144.Black Tap Craft Burger & Beers,[u'This place is a "highly" recommended place to eat at when coming to New York City. I think this has been the BEST burger and shakes I have ever had-EVER! The music is all 90\'s hip-hop (which I LOVE). I enjoyed the Greg Norman burger and it was delicious. The shakes are HUGE and also delicious. I will most definitely be back with my family on the next New York Trip. \n\nP.S. Best time to come is 15/30 minutes before opening to avoid waiting in a LONGGGGG line. But the wait is 100% worth it.' u"Probably one of the best burgers and milkshakes I've had in New York City! I had such a positive experience when I was here back in June and I say overall when you're in the neighborhood and you want a good burger and milkshake go here!! And also there should be one in LA because it would do so well there!\n\nAmbiance:\n\nI heard and I've seen that there have been 2 hour lines to get into the restaurant but we lucked out that we only waited 15 minutes. You have to take a very narrow set of stairs to get down to Black Tap (there might be another level but we went down the stairs). It's actually pretty small in there but it is has a very pretty setup. Every part of the restaurant calls for a hipster photo on your blog. I even got a few pictures of myself in here! Lots of people order the milkshakes don't know how big they are and only finish 1/3 of it.\n\nService:\n\nI don't really remember the service but the guy who bought us into the restaurant seemed to be very happy with what he was doing and was super friendly. I believe our waitress was friendly and accommodating and bought our food in a pretty reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nFood (the most important part):\n\nAs much as the other two parts matter the food is of course the best part of Black Tap! We had burgers here (a regular burger and a marinara mozzarella pizza burger). I got the regular which was pretty tasty but the pizza burger my dad had was the best I've ever tasted. The sauce was delish with the already flavorful patty and mozzarella! I was so hungry I didn't have time to take a picture of my burger. We tried to save room for the milkshake but ended up eating almost all of our burgers. The milkshake we ordered in advanced and got it about 5 minutes after our burgers. That thing was a monstrosity! It had all of our favorite things in it but it was limited edition which is sad. It was the rainbow fruity pebbles shake and it was so worth taking a photo of. My dad and I ended up surprising the waitress and my mom because we finished it!" u'DISCLAIMER: If you want to bring little kids the music is BLASTING and it is NOT EDITED.  If you want your kids to hear "99 Problems" etc. with nothing edited out at least now you know.\n\nNow onto the food.  The burgers are great the shakes are amazing the service not so much.  Our table of 4 ordered 3 burgers one salad and 2 shakes.  The shakes came out before the food which we thought was a little odd (normally it would all come together or after the meal?  It is kind of like dessert...) and the wait for the shakes and the food was not long at all.  I must say for a place that is "famous" for their crazy shakes their burgers are also out of this world!  What is preventing me from giving them 5 stars is the service.  We got our order taken the shakes/food delivered and then we were ignored the rest of the time.  After trying to flag down several servers who just walked by us we joked that the food must be free since we were trying to pay for a good 10 minutes.' u"If you're reading this review stop and go get in line..right now.  Apparently a lot of people know about this greatness. The line was down the street around 2pm on a Saturday.  Candidly we went somewhere else for lunch and was disappointed.  We went back around 10:15pm and there was still a line. Roughly a 30 minute wait.  \n\nWhen I stepped in the restaurant I was greeted by a dope mural and hip hop muisc. This is New York the city that is constantly buzzing. There were these massive Shakes passing me by...and I simply felt at home. \n\nFull disclosure we walked in and placed a to-go order for a juicy turkey burger and fries because our time was limited. The food was ready in about 25 - 30 minutes.  Overall it was a great experience. I have Black Tap bookmarked to explore the menu further and have dessert on my next visit to The City." u'This place is worth the wait. I arrived with a group of 4 on Saturday at lunch time. There was a line out the door but looks are deceiving this place has a really fast turn around. We waited about 30min before we were seated. \n\nOnce we sat we ordered right away. I got the Californian burger and my fianc\xe9 got the Bison burger. We were so hungry that neither of us shared but I can tell you we both were extremely satisfied with our meals. While we ordered our burgers the waitress told us that the shakes take about 20-30 min to make so it\'s best to order everything at once. \n\nWe ordered our shakes at the same time as the burgers and they came out shortly after we were done eating. They have the timing down to a science! The milkshake was delicious but in all honesty you\'re paying $15 for the "look" of the milkshake. They load the top portion of the glass up with fixings but the glass itself is small and skinny. Don\'t get me wrong they\'re very filling and delicious but the shake is more expensive than a burger. \n\nI enjoyed the experience the food and the service so 5 stars from me!' u"I followed this place forever on Instagram before my trip to New York. I heard amazing things about the burgers and the milkshakes look like a childhood dream so when my boyfriend and I were back in New York this summer visiting my family. After a nice stroll through Central Park we headed over to Black Tap. They have a line area outside which we quickly jumped in and got lucky - the group ahead of us was too large but they had a table for 2! \n\nThe inside is quite small with cool graffiti all over the walls vintage music playing & an 80's 90's vibe throughout. It screams fun [& is very New York]! We got to sit at a small table right by the counter where they make the shakes so it was pretty cool to watch. After perusing the menu and wanting to order absolutely everything but having to hold ourselves back we ordered a side Caesar Salad [$6]  the Greg Norman burger [$19] and a Bam Bam Shake [$15] for dessert.\n\nMy Caesar salad was good and quite large but squeezed into a small bowl that made it hard to eat. The burger was a wagyu beef burger with a house buttermilk-dill aioli blue cheese & spicy arugula. It came with fries which we upgraded to sweet potato. The burger was juicy flavorful and delicious and they had no problem cutting it in half for us so we could share. I wished we had each ordered our own burger but we had more food journey's to go on that day.  Finally we ended with our glorious shake: the Bam Bam. The Bam Bam is a fruity pebbles shake with a vanilla frosted rim covered in fruity pebbles a fruity pebbles rice krispy treat a strawberry frosted pop tart a nerds rope whipped cream and a cherry. SUGAR OVERLOAD! But we ate the whole thing because gluttony can be fun. Its hard to say what I would come back for more the burgers or shake.\n\nPrices are obviously a bit higher but the quality of food was up to par and we had excellent service. They provided water and beers for us quickly and checked in a few times. They also helped us buy some tshirts and such when closing our bill. Note the bathroom was gnarly so I recommend waiting to go somewhere else. Overall we had the best time here and look forward to coming back again! FYI: great social media pictures to be taken here ;)" u'The hype has finally simmered down. We only had a short wait in line for a table for two. We parked on Broadway and did a two hours parking meter and we were able to wait in line order get our food and eat all in an hour and 15 minutes.\n\nService was great. Our waiter checked up on us constantly to assure we had all we needed. He got us in and our of the restaurant without feeling rushed.\n\nFood was pretty damn good. I really enjoyed the chicken sandwich. It was huge! Portions are more than generous. However the $2.00 substitution for  onion rings is totally not worth it. I would suggest to just keep the fries. \n\nShakes were more than insta-ready. We ordered the cake shake which was delicious! But for $15 a shake..... At least the huge slice of cake sort of made up for it.' u"Came with my friend on a Thursday night and we got seated almost immediately even though we weren't near the front of the line. So would recommend going in smaller parties.\n\nWe split the chips and guacamole ($9) I got the Texan Burger ($17) and a Cookies 'N Cream Supreme crazy shake ($15). She got the Steak Au Poivre Burger ($16) an Ommegang Witte beer ($8) and a Brooklyn Blackout crazy shake ($15). Absolutely everything was just incredible. I felt like I spent a lot but that I was getting very high quality food and in the case of the crazy shake very unique food. \n\nThis is definitely not the place to go if you're watching your wallet or your waistline but if you're on vacation in NYC and want good tasting food that looks good for your Instagram Black Tap definitely delivers. Would definitely come back! Great service too btw." u"Had an awesome experience here.  First off they sell crazy shakes.  Yeah I know they're $15.  But this is New York where every price is inflated.  And how can you see a picture of it on yelp or someone else order one and not do the same thing?  So yeah I got a crazy shake.  Definitely worth the experience at least once.  I also got the Texan burger.  I added a fried egg and chipotle mayo.  The meat was cooked perfectly super juicy.  Loved the burger.  The shake was an experience.  I ordered the cookies and cream crazy shake.  It could have been enjoyed by more than one person.  But I have no problem being gluttonous and taking it on alone.  It was hard to finish by myself though with the burger.  \n\nHere is why they get 4 stars.  First no ice in their water.  Other places in New York were similar not sure why New York restaurants are so skimpy with the ice but it was a little annoying.  Also when we were done and ready to get out of there it took our waiter 15 minutes to bring us the bill.  Nothing worth no going to the restaurant over I definitely still recommend going.  But this time around they get 4 stars.\n\nUpdate to 5 stars\nI went in again a couple days later before heading back home.  Much better service experience.  This time I did the Greg Norman their award winning burger.  I don't usually like arugula or blue cheese.  But on this burger it just works.  That beef they use on the Greg Norma's is awesome too.  Next time I'm in New York I'm coming back." u"The notorious Black Tap home of the insta famous milkshakes (and burgers too). We visited here on a Sunday during lunch which meant we didn't have to wait in line outside for 2 hours to get a table. We ordered the cake shake and burgers for everyone. The shake was huge (as expected) and quite tasty. The burgers were disappointing. The meat was very bland and the fries were extremely plain. I can only recommend the shakes here and echo the thoughts of the rest of the group when I say skip the burgers just go here for the shakes. Will return but only to try another ludicrous milkshake." u"Overpriced tourist trap. The burgers were way over cooked and downright disappointing.  I ordered medium rare and got well done. They care more about the milkshakes which are good but not worth the price.  You're better off going across the street to the Burger Shack in Parker Le Meridian." u"It's a super hyped up spot and everyone goes here to see what it's all about and I fit right into that category! \n\nMust try: \nSweet potato fries\n\nAndddddddd...wait for it! \nBirthday cake shake! It's as sweet as it sounds and it doesn't even have to be your birthday to have this goodie! They actually put a piece of cake on top of your milkshake. And that cake is everything! Definitely get it to share because I had a sugar rush by the time I was done mine. \n\nI believe it's their most popular so it runs out fast just keep that in mind!" u"Black Tap did a great job with social media because one of my friends dragged me here. I'm not the biggest fan of burgers and I don't even like ridiculous smoothies. But I haven't seen my friend in forever so Black Tap it was. \n\nThere was no wait which I thought was weird for dinner but once we sat down I saw a line accumulate by the door. My friend ordered a smoothie and we both ordered a burger. The smoothie looks delicious and it's very gram-worthy so I get it. It was super sweet and my friend couldn't finish hers. We both ordered their burgers and although they were satisfying they just seemed like your run of the mill burger. \n\nThe service here was phenomenal though. Our waiter was so funny and personal that it made the whole experience great. I probably won't return but it's a good place to go once for the smoothies." u"This review is for the Sour Power Milkshake and passion fruit lemonade. \n\nMy girlfriends and I came here for dessert. We didn't mind the wait. We waited for about 30 mins. We were busy looking at the reviews and images of the milkshakes to decide on one. \n\nIt's huge inside. Customer service is good. In the women's restroom there are two stalls but only one sink working. \n\nIf you like sour and sweet flavors sour power is perfect. There were colorful sweet and sour gum drops all over the rim pasted with vanilla cake frosting. The black cherry milkshake tastes good but a bit too sweet for my taste. The whip cream is delicious. Nerd candies were dispersed on top of the whip cream. It was tasty! There are so many candies involved in this drink. \n\nI recommend 3 adults to share this.  It is picture worthy. You also have the option to order just a milkshake for half the price of the special one." u"I found this place through different online bloggers and food reviewers raving about how crazy good the shakes here are and after my boyfriend saw the pictures he was set on coming here. There were only two parties in front of us when we arrived and the line moves pretty quickly especially if you're spending your wait time staring at the menus they have posted outside. \n\nI wasn't especially hungry so I just ordered a Nutella shake. The boyfriend ordered the Texan burger and a Sour Power shake. I thought the Nutella shake was more regular chocolate than hazelnut chocolate and didn't wow me quite like the Hopdoddy's Nutella pretzel shake which is my benchmark for all Nutella shakes. The Sour Power black cherry shake didn't taste much like cherry at all but had a good amount of other sweets for decoration but the sour belts are stale a knock-off version of the Sour Punch belts. The boyfriend loved the burger and we Texans were very proud. The huge portion of meat and the bacon - yum yum yum. He also really appreciated the Sriracha mustard and ketchup bottles already on the counter for easy access." u"The burgers were good but the fries were cold and doesn't live up to my expectations. I had the Texas n my friend had the original burger. The drinks on the other hand were delicious." u'Worth the stop if you don\'t have to wait a long time. Burgers are all tasty. Buns get a demerit for being a little too soft to support size of paddy. The Greg Norman burger was great to try as a change of pace. It had the right complement of blue cheese and greens. Skip the onion rings. They don\'t look great in the pictures and that is representative of the taste and texture. The sweet potato fries are worth the up charge.  \n\nThe shakes are more "sizzle than steak" but worth getting for the art and experience.' u"I have been to two black tap locations and this was my most recent. After their popularity from viral marketing I was sucked in and me and the wife had to try it. \n\nThe first time we went had the shakes and burgers. Nothing was memorable however now honey is pregnant so she was craving a milkshake and it was the only place I could think of as we had been at Mt Sinai earlier for an appointment so we came right over. \n\nThis location has a much quicker line or did for us. We we're in about 15 minutes but we were a party of two. All parties of three or more kept waiting as the smaller parties walked past. Worked out for us but this would piss me off being passed up three times if I was part of a group with only one more person. You can sometimes wait over an hour at these places. \n\nWe ordered burgers and had the completely wrong order brought to us twice. They were mixups for the table but then people seated after us started eating and apparently we sent back the wrong orders but when they gave another customer our order they kept and ate it. Who does that?\n\nAnyway we alerted the waitress and they got the right order out next. Burgers are OK but I mean it's crazy to come here for a burger and a designer shake (and I've done it twice). You should do one of the other or it's just too much. Shake shack has much better burgers and better quality. I'd compare this to an Applebee's. For a place called Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer I'd also expect the craft beer selection to be better. \n\nThe shakes are insane. They are great to look at. Freaking amazing. My favorite part about the shake is all the fudge and toppings on the rim. The only problem is it's just way too much food. It's so sweet and on the one my wife got there was literally an entire piece of cake. We started to feel guilty as we watched everyone remove and leave the insane toppings. It's very wasteful. The shake itself is pretty damn good and for $8 you can get one that's not as crazy as the $15 shakes. \n\nWould return for a normal shake. Never again for dinner." u'If you are not pre-diabetic at the start of your meal you will be after you ordered a shake. So much sugar in the shake. There are elaborate designs for each shake which is great for someone\'s birthday or you are in the mood for a treat. Otherwise my liver recommends not getting the shake. \n\nThe burger- I ordered the greg norman burger "2016 Best in Land Burger". I would rate the burger as phenomenal as it was juicy (not from the fat juicy but from quality of the meat). Highly recommended. Everything went together very well. I can understand why it won a burger competition.\n\nThere is usually a wait on the line. I waited approximately 40 minutes. The shakes takes awhile to make as it seems like everybody orders one. Black Tap falls on the special occasion destination bookmark. I wouldn\'t get the shakes on a regular basis. For a 40 minute wait for a great burger it is hard to convince myself to make a second trip.' u"Hands down the best milkshake I've ever had!! I was visiting New York and I'm so glad I made it to this location. I can't wait to visit New York again just so I can have their milkshakes. Their burgers were also soo good!!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
191.Thai Villa,[u"This place is dripping with opulence. As soon as you walk through the large red doors you are taken to another world. The decor reminds me of the Temples in Thailand; gold everywhere and extravagantly lavash. \n\nMake sure you call ahead for a reservation. I made one for 8:30pm on a Tuesday and the waiting room was packed. There was a celebrity that walked in after me with no reservation and they told that person it would be a 30 minute wait. \n\nWe ordered:\nDrinks: Thai Iced Tea\nApps: Ray Rai Nah Phu & Spicy Chicken Wings \nMain: Red Curry w. Chicken & Pad Se Ew \n\nThe wait staff were very attentive refilling your water removing empty plates and taking additional orders. You don't have to call on your original server anyone working there is happy to help. \n\nThe Thai Iced Tea was delicious. A perfect sweet (but not too sweet) drink to accompany with your spicy dishes. \n\nThe Ray Rai Nah Phu came in small saucers. This bit sized appetizer had a burst of coconut flavor with a curry zing to it. The Spicy Chicken Wings although not as spicy as I wanted were also quite good. They were large sized pieces and had a great crunchy outer layer with a spicy/tangy sauce. \n\nThe Red Curry w. Chicken was my favorite. I was looking for a really spicy dish and this hit the spot. The coconut milk balanced the heat in every bite. I just wish the side of rice it came with was larger. The Pad Se Ew was also good. We had to ask for chili sauce to make it more spicy. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place if you want to WOW a date or celebrate a special event. It's a beautiful spot with great food and service!" u'Beautiful location with your assortment of Thai food and the clever idea of having a "royal" menu to add some taste sides and price to your usually good eats.\n\nSo many options to choose from here so be ready to be impressed with a variety and a great ambiance but when it comes to the food and price I\'m not impressed. \n\nIf you want to impress a date with the right setting yet want to seem cultured a bit or know your way around a large and complex menu come check it out.' u"Came in on a Saturday at 3pm knowing that they're closed at 4. So by 330 and last call we placed our order for soup appetizer entree and dessert for 2. It's such a shame I had such hope for this place. Beautiful decor good partner to eat with friendly and capable staff and delicious food. Sadly I only enjoyed 2 out 4 of what I mentioned.\n\nThe food was just ridiculously salty and the dessert never came. Don't mean to be negative but for what I paid.." u"I came here with a group of 4 to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We made a reservation for 6pm on a Wednesday night. I was super surprised to see that they were really busy. They don't seat you until the whole party is there so make sure everyone comes on time! \n\nThai Villa is beautiful. Upon stepping inside there is a small wait area with seats. Going in the restaurant it may seem small but they have upstairs seating as well. The lights inside the restaurant was pretty. And the dining tables under the lights gave off a romantic vibe. This place is definitely a nice place to go on a date.\n\nFor starters we ordered the fried calamari. It was fried well and the sauce had a very small kick of spice to it. \n\nI had the chicken pad thai which was good. It was the right amount of serving and I'm glad that they put the peanuts on the side instead of on the top of the noodles. Although the chicken was on the dry side it wasn't horrendous. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the sorbet trio which came with mango lemon and either strawberry/raspberry. I thought that it was refreshing although very hard to break and scoop up to eat. \n\nWe also ordered the Thai Medley Compote. It reminded me of honey bread with mochi and coconut icecream and condensed milk. The small was kind of strong and this was something I've never had before. The mochi (rice cake) was good and chewy. I really enjoyed the coconut icecream. But the honey bread was soaked in condensed milk which isn't how I'm normally used to having. \n\nOverall Thai Villa is a nice place to get dinner and take someone out on a date. It's cozy and seriously beautiful inside!" u"Such a beautiful restaurant; Love the gold leaf decor so much. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered:\n-Kao Tang Na Tung (rice cracker w/ minced shrimp pork crab meat coconut milk & lemon grass) \n-Ray Rai Nah Phu (minced shrimp rice noodles curry paste wrapped in betel leaves & topped with  crab meat \n\nEntrees:\n-Royal pad thai\n-red curry\n-special duck dish that was recommended by our waitress \n\nPresentation with each dish was nicely done & the dishes were flavorful and had great spice. I didn't care too much for the appetizers but I enjoyed the pad Thai curry & duck entrees greatly. \n\nWe also ordered a Thai iced tea and ended up getting a 2nd thai tea each because we enjoyed it so much & it was perfectly refreshing to have with our spicy food." u"One of the main reasons why I had this place bookmarked was because of the gorgeous interior design. Finally decided to come for a birthday dinner with my girls. With all the good reviews and high ratings I came in with high expectations regarding the food. I been to Thailand so I really wanted to see if this place lives up to the authenticity of Thai food. \n\nIt seems like it's really hard and near impossible to have a reservation here especially on a Friday or Saturday evening. If you're going to come here for dinner I suggest to come around 5:30/6pm so you don't have to wait extremely long. Service here is mediocre. Not super attentive and since it gets quite busy inside the waiter tends to forget about you once your food is served. Yes there interior design is gorgeous and is definitely picture worthy but that's all I can say that was great about this place. \n\nMy friends and I ordered Thai Ice Teas and Lychee Ice Tea to start and they were way too sweet for our likings. Had some appetizers to start such as curry puffs ray rai nai phu and meing kum. The appetizers were okay wasn't something that made me say wow that was good. I ordered chilean sea bass in aromatic coconut milk and it was good. The sea bass was soft and the tiny kick of slickness was perfect with the meal. Tried some of my friend's pad thai and I wasn't too impressed. \n\nOverall food was okay. Not as great as I hope. I feel like they Americanized their food a bit to please their customers. I had authentic Thai food in Thailand and this place doesn't come close. I had Thai food else where in Brooklyn that was a closer representation to Thai food and way better than here. Not a place I'll come back to. Glad other people enjoyed it here but nope not me." u"Beautiful restaurant with incredibly unique Thai food. I've never had Thai food quite like the dishes here. First off the place is gorgeous from the waiting room to the booths everything looks like gilded gold. Even the bathrooms were beautiful....how is that possible??? We got here at 5:30 and things looked like they were just filling up by the time we left at 7 there was a line outside the door. They don't take reservations on certain days & the entire party has to be present so plan accordingly.\n\nWe got 2 appetizers the Ray Rai (curry & crab meat in a leaf bowl) and Kao Tang (same base on a warm rice krispy thing. Both were incredible. Even though they had the same curry the base & texture change was lovely. For the main course I got the Kaeng Neur Lamyai Bai Chapoo (braised beef coconut longan meat). It was spicy and delicious! There was a lot so I didn't finish it. We also got the seafood crepe and a chicken stir fry (sorry I forgot the name). The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Thai iced coffee which was kinda dark & didn't have enough condensed milk. Otherwise this is a fantastic restaurant." u"A reservation was made the day before at 7:30p. We were seated within a few minutes. While walking through the restaurant I was in shock by the decor and the size of the restaurant. This place is two floors filled with majestic decorations that would honestly convince me that I was in Thailand if I was under the influence or something.\n\nI tried the Kao Tang Na Tung and the Pad Se-ew. Both were good! Kao Tang Na Tung is minced shrimp and some other seasoning placed ontop of a rice cracker. I just followed what other yelpers recommended and I was surprised by how tasty it was. Pad se-ew tasted like any other pad se-ew. I definitely want to come back to try the other things on the menu.\n\nI suggest making reservations as I heard it gets pretty hectic during the dinner time. Definitely a great place for an intimate dinner NOT a great place for children. It is also quite loud depending on where you sit. \n\nRandom thought: After ending the dinner with a discussion about really creepy movies I went to the bathroom and it was so dim that it freaked me out. So uh.. I guess don't go to the bathroom right after conversations about scary topics lol." u'I wanted to check out this place because of the d\xe9cor. I would come back for the ambiance. The food is pretty decent. It is authentic. The spiciness is actually spicy unlike many places. I think the royal pad thai is more about presentation. I will probably order a regular pad thai next time. The duck salad appetizer with pomelo was delicious. The portion sizes are good for sharing family style. \n\nI will come back to sit in the booth. I came here with party of 2 only. We sat in the center of the main dining room next to other tables. It was hard to speak because you have to speak over the tables right next to you.' u"Great place with great ambiance. The inside decoration is superb. The food is well decorated tasty and well apportioned. The food might be a bit spicy at times so you better ask the waiter/waitress first about the level of spiciness of the food before ordering. \n\nService can be lacking at times. The waiter was too rush and didn't fill the water too often. \n\nOverall it is a great place to come to have an awesome time with friends XD" u'Really underwhelming. The Yelp reviews were great so my expectations were high but it didn\'t live up to the hype.\n\nThe decor was nice and had small "villa" like booths - definitely a 5 on decor especially for Thai which typically has simple interiors. \n\nHowever the food was overpriced and sub-par. The meal began with a free chunk of watermelon which was very exciting but had weird salty toppings. My boyfriend and I split a vegetable crepe appetizer which wasn\'t that flavorful (but did have a cool blue crepe) the beef pad see ew which was pretty standard and the chicken green curry which was a bit odd. \n\nThe restaurant is a solid 3 - I wouldn\'t choose to go back but I wouldn\'t protest if a friend wanted to go here for a birthday.' u'Thai Villa is an architectural beast. I have never seen a restaurant with the uniqueness in design similar to this one.\n\nThe food was equally beastly. Thai food is my favorite cuisine. So it is saying something when I say this place has the best thai in NYC.\n\nA note it is a bit more americanized and not that "authentic thai". If you are ok with that then come here blindly....you will not be disappointed.' u"This is an updated review. I have to say Joe the owner has put in a lot\nOf work and thought to his place. I also appreciate the fact that he takes time to read and respond to the reviews. The food here is amazing. Flavorful savory and cooked w quality. They also cater to vegetarians which my friend who dined in w me appreciated and it was so easy to order. Stag is amazingly friendly. I will def be back here whenever I am in town. Cheers blessings and all the success on this place that's a hidden gem." u"Great Thai food. They've got a million options so there's something for everyone! Decor is gorgeous as you probably know. \n\nI started with a Thai iced tea (delicious) and shared:\n\n+ taro chips\n+ curry puffs\n+ pad Thai\n+ Cornish hen\n+ mango sticky rice\n\nThe apps were great. Pad thai was my favorite main. Every dish had a beautiful presentation and it was a nice surprise to find out the rice in the dessert was blue! In general I find it kind of unusual to see mango sticky rice on menus around here (if you disagree please drop me a DM and give me reccs because I love the stuff) so it was a treat." u"Thai Villa is definitely is one of (if not) the best Thai restaurants I've been to since moving to New York! The service space and food all come together to make for a worthwhile dining experience in the Flatiron area. All I can say is make a reservation NOW!\n\nI stopped in with a friend (after making a reservation) on a Tuesday night. After first glance you can't help but notice how beautifully decorated the space is. It has an assortment of golden leaves hanging from the ceiling which makes for an experience in itself. After my friend arrived we were promptly seated at a table on the second floor towards the back.\n\nWe started with a shared appetizer specifically the Kao Tang Na Tung ($10). It's a mixture of shrimp pork and crab meat on rice crackers which were extremely tasty. I HIGHLY recommend.\n\nWhen it came time to order the entree's I ended up choosing the Param ($14-$15). It's a sauteed meat dish which also has vegetables cooked alongside it (Also cooked in a peanut sauce). It was extremely filling and also really savory. If you're looking for a dish on the heavier side with sweet and meaty kick definitely go for this one.\n\nGreat food great service and a great atmosphere definitely makes for a five-star experience. Visit ASAP." u"I was visiting NYC for the weekend and my friends from college and I had dinner at Thai Villa on a busy Friday night. The restaurant was packed and we had to wait a little bit despite our reservation but it wasn't long before we were seated. When you walk into the restaurant you instantly notice all the gold colors illuminating the entire space. Our group was seated in a large booth with a lot of gold decor and lighting. It was beautiful!\n\nWe started out with a complimentary appetizer of watermelon with topped with minced fish crumble. Yes it sounds weird I know - but it actually tasted pretty good! The sweet juicy watermelon actually paired well with the salty tangy fish! For our main courses two of my friends had the green and red curry entr\xe9es which were pretty spicy but they enjoyed their meals. I ended up sharing a few dishes with a couple of my other friends: Kha Nom Boung Youen (mixed seafood in a crispy egg crepe) Kua Gai noodles and Panang curry w/ crispy duck. All of the food was absolutely delicious!! My favorite had to be the Kha Nom Boung Youen - but they were all so good. The dishes were flavorful and unique. \n\nOverall my friends and I had a wonderful time at Thai Villa. The staff was super nice and welcoming and I can't wait to come back!" u"Thai villa has definitely won me over (or at least my first experience here did).\n\nThe minute I walked in I knew I wanted to eat here regardless of the wait (they told me it was a 30 minute wait for a party of two). You could tell that this restaurant is authentic - the staff spoke Thai and I had noticed that a good amount of the customers were also Thai (or at least they were speaking in Thai). The decor and ambience is on point and I must say the food is even better! They have a large menu consisting of your basic Thai foods that you'd find at most Thai restaurants a wide selection of local Thai foods and their chef's specialties.\n\nSince I've eaten at a fair share of Thai restaurants I decided to go with items on their local Thai foods menu. I got two appetizers and the royal pad thai and this was enough for two people to share. The presentation of the royal pad thai was beautiful and the entree itself was bursting with flavor. Between the appetizers I liked the ray rai nah phu (I would recommend this) more than the gai hor bai touy (chicken in pandan leaves).\n\nI enjoyed my meal here so much that I came back two weeks later and ordered the pad kee mao which was alright (a bit salty). I also got the the pun sib salmon (salmon puffs) as an appetizer to share and though it was good the puff pastries were quite small so I didn't really think it was worth the price.\n\nIf I were to come again I'd definitely go with the Thai local foods menu and try some new appetizers." u'First walking into this restaurant it was so beautiful! Excellent decor! We started with the dumplings and the chicken satay which were both delicious. For entr\xe9es we got the read chicken curry and the royal pai thai. The red curry was very good but the royal pai thai fell short. I had purchased that one over the regular since it seemed to have extra items that made it more authentic but it was just meh. Overall I would definitely come back and maybe try different entr\xe9es.' u"Absolutely beautiful restaurant that I can't believe their price point isn't higher. Have been here now twice with work buddies and everyone enjoyed the food. Lunch specials come with appetizer and soup or salad. Highly recommend their mushroom house soup the cashew nut entree and curries. If you love spice then don't be shy to ask for extra heat!\nWe'll be back!" u"The interior decor of this place was absolutely stunning... Elegant and high class with gorgeous and beautifully detailed gold leaves hanging down from the ceiling and golden lights throughout the restaurant. The Thai Villa menu is also quite lovely: A black book with a dainty silver tree on a circular shaped cut out in front. \n\nI decided to order a Thai Iced Coffee which was pretty good though a little more condensed milk would have been nice... I prefer my coffee a bit sweeter. \n\nWe were given an amouse-bouche of watermelon cubes with savory flakes on top. I am not a fan of watermelon but this wasn't bad. \n\nFor the appetizer we ordered the tumeric coconut fried calamari which came with a delightful roasted bell pepper-peanut vinaigrette dipping sauce. There was the flavor of tumeric but I was disappointed because I couldn't taste the coconut at all. The calamari was nicely fried but tasted like regular calamari. I was expecting it to be more unique. \n\nI tried the Kea Mao with crispy duck which consisted of broad noodles chili onion bell pepper egg and basil leaves.The crispy duck was great with the skin being wonderfully crunchy and the meat being tender well seasoned and yummy. The noodles were just okay.\n\nService was pretty good... Quick and efficient. I just was not wowed by the food so wouldn't come back."],-0.4449,0.0,0.774,0.226
129.Gotan,[u"I've woken up this weekend to Gotan in the living room for breakfast twice. The first morning I had coffee orange juice avocado toast with feta cheese potatoes bacon and eggs and Greek yogurt with fruit and sliced almonds/oatmeal that make it have the consistency of ice cream. The second morning I forgot as I was quite sleepy but I remember it being really good too. \n\nIt's a filling healthy and hipster place with a great price point. While I haven't been there in person yet the food I had was delicious." u"Hard to follow them cant keep coffee in stock for pour overs then finally told no pour overs between 12-2 but they close at 3???\n\nAfter 5 times of trying to get a pour over finally gave up. Just take it off the damn menu if you don't wanna make it." u'What we ordered: Avocado toast ($10) | Acai Bowl ($10) \n\nTaste: Portion was huge for the avocado toast. I felt that there was too much feta cheese. The acai bowl had a variety of fruits like fig strawberry blueberry etc. I just thought it was too soupy. I prefer more frozen acai and acai that is sweeter. Their bowl was a little too tart for my taste. \n\nAmbiance is really nice but I was bummed out  that we smelled like the food after eating inside.' u'Gotan is a rather charming little restaurant specializing in breakfast and lunches with an aim at what would be considered healthy foods. It has an interesting d\xe9cor I might best describe as being faux ruin with bricks showing with intentionally diminished plaster. You order at the counter are given a number to place on your table and merely wait for your order to arrive. \n\nFor my meal I had their Salmon Bialy (baily refers to the bread which is very close to that of a bagel) totally delicious with a good heap up their own house cured salmon along with an herb mascarpone (an Italian cr\xe8me cheese) side with a really delicious super dill enhanced pickle. \n\nTaste wise and price wise Gotan is a far better deal than those of nearby or surrounding restaurants.' u'Great find had the chicken soup and it came with toasted bread and pesto spread.  It was loaded with chucks of chicken and plenty of vegetables.  My friends at the table had avocado toast which I tried and that was also very good.  They loved it.' u"Cute cafe located a few blocks away from Times Square. My dad and I came here to rest and grab a quick pick me up while my mom and sister were souvenirs shopping. \n\nI got an iced almond milk chai latte which was a tad too sweet for my but the cup it came it was super cute and my dad got a hot mocha which came with  pretty latte art and finished it real quick. \n\nGotan also serves food for breakfast/brunch/lunch and pastries. It seems like a really cute study spot. Plenty of tables and free wifi! Check it out if you're in the area." u"Great brunch deal! Includes entree fresh OJ and coffee. Everything was well made delicious. Fluffy scrambled eggs sprinkled with chives and soft yummy biscuit. Filling and good value. \n\nHonestly the best black coffee I've had in midtown. Props Gotan!" u"This place is a wonderful spot to chill out and grab a bite to eat in midtown. I've only been for breakfast but I'm sure their other items are great too.\n\nI opted for the Scrambled Cheddar Biscuit - made of fluffy scrambled eggs with cheddar and chives mixed in served with a biscuit and tomato jam. It was delicious and came out of the kitchen quickly. (See pic)\n\nService was very friendly and the line (if there is one) moves fast. The tables could use a little more of a wipe down between customers but that's a minor thing." u"I ran away from my office longer than I should have because I really really wanted avocado toast for lunch and of course I had to go to the most bougie millennial place of them all. Now I've been to Gotan a few times before for brunch & I always left satisfied. The location's decently sized with a weekday lunchtime crowd consisting of young professionals grabbing a bite freelancers working on their laptops & a few tourists who wandered in from Times Square. The cafe has a hip modern feel with people slowly sipping soy lattes juxtaposed by waiters rushing around delivering fattoush salads.\n\nYou order at the counter get a number stand and grab a seat. It's busy but not overcrowded. Your meal (in this circumstance avocado feta toast with an egg) will be brought to you promptly afterward. The toppings were delicious--tomatoes doused with EVOO fresh feta and A LOT of ripe avocado. The presentation was a winner but unfortunately the egg was a little too runny (some of the whites were still liquid) and a corner of the thick multigrain toast was burnt. It wasn't terrible enough where the food was deemed inedible but it was distracting enough where even the avocado couldn't mask it. \n\nIt's hard to be quick & perfect but the menu--brimming with ingenious combinations that ensure Gotan isn't just another basic brunch joint has me yearning to venture back." u"Food was good the cappuccino & the coffee are okay the experience is better if you like a little heat on your food...which my other half doesn't so my review went from 4 to 3." u"It's a busy lunch service as I sit here and write a review for this coffee destination. People are dropping in left and right but for some reason the place doesn't feel too crowded. It is rather larger compared to other coffee places in the area but with the amount of peeps stopping by even the biggest of stores can suddenly become bottlenecked.  Gotan however busy they maybe still feels welcoming and not stifling. I was able to grab a seat very quickly and noticed that there were still plenty of open spots left. Perhaps the customers in the area are in too much of a rush to sit and relax. Anyways more open space for me!  \n\nI really love the classic coffee-house motif this place exudes with effective use of exposed bricks and air ducts.  It gives it a very modern and NYC look...which obviously it should have. Anyways I ordered an iced chai latte when I came here and found it quite yummy. Nothing really groundbreaking but still left me satisfied.  I wouldn't have a problem coming here again when I'm in the area. Maybe I can comment on the food offering this time around." u"I was debating on what to eat hungover for brunch and remembered just how delicious everything looked the last time I went to Gotan. I went and honestly whenever I'm in the area I think I will always eat here for brunch. Or dinner. This place is SO phenomenal but it can also be the fact that I've been craving Mediterranean all the time for some reason.\n\nFirst of all kudos for a caf\xe9 to not only give you table service (the staff always do a walk-around the caf\xe9 to drop off orders or pick up any finished plates). The kitchen is also completely open so not only do you see everyone working on each plate--everything is so beautifully presented--but also the smell is incredible.\n\nWe got the hummus vegetable plate shakshuka and the tuna salad. I left so satiated and so pleased and with this review I want to go back like tomorrow." u'It\'s in the heart of midtown. \n\nWe found this place by typing "healthy food" into the options after church.\n\nWe got the brunch deal of coffee and juice and an entr\xe9e for $13.\nThe juice is really sweet and tasty.  The avocado toast was good.\n\nwe also got the acai bowl.  It was on the less cold side. I like my acai bowls a bit more chilled.\n\nOtherwise if I were in the area I\'d go back again.' u'I am such a huuuugeee fan of this place. I went here for breakfast for my very first day and the meal was so satisfying. \nI bought a glass of orange juice ($5) and an avocado feta toast ($10). The entire meal was really fulfilling and fairly large. \nThe orange juice was fairly pricy but I think the freshly squeezed orange juice was definitely worth it. :) I really loved the avocado toast because of the massive amounts of avocado touches of radish and sprouts and a spritz of lime and feta just combined perfectly.' u"Really nice cafe/lunch spot in midtown - This place has actual been on my To-Yelp list for a while really upset I didn't go here sooner. Aside from some very decent coffee and some great-looking breakfast goodies they serve really thoughtfully-crafted sandwiches and salads. They serve a pretty mean-looking avocado toast that I certainly wouldn't mind trying next time as well as 'health bowls' (\n\nThe ordering process here is a 'order at counter take a number table flag pole thing and put it where you're sitting we'll come find you' deal. Convenient if you're not in a super rush but I could see where it could be tight if you're in a rush. That said the service I experienced was rather prompt and kind.\n\nI ordered the much-Yelped Tuna Avocado salad and it was Fantastic! The tuna salad had chunks of tuna and little filler/mayo had tons of avocado (didn't cheap out at all) and pesto-laden crustini's were a great touch for some extra crunch. And the egg yolky goodness!! Amazing.\n\nI'll definitely be back. Gotan is some good stuff." u'Cheap when it comes to filling drink cups. I ordered a juice in the morning and my cup was only filled about 75%. I asked if they could top it up and I saw the manager lecture that person for filling my cup all the way. Don\'t be cheap... Or get a smaller cup or at least pretend with filler ice cubes! It left a bad taste in my mouth in an already expensive breakfast joint. \n\nThe breakfast sandwich that I got was good but it was dripping with grease and I would have been equally happy with a significantly cheaper (and maybe less "fancy"?) sandwich. Service was quick. It\'s a cute spot if you sit in (I got my food to go). But for the service and prices I won\'t make this a regular spot.' u'Great spot for breakfast. We got the avocado toast brunch special where you get juice and a coffee. Delicious!\nAlso good place to study' u"We ate here every morning on a recent NYC trip.  So. Good.\n\nInitially we came here because it was steps away from our hotel and we were super hungry.  We ended up loving it so much that we planned to come back every single day.\n\nThe location for me was great because it was so close to our hotel but I cannot say if its an easy place for a Native.  Its very unassuming from the outside so thankfully they had a sign on the sidewalk directing us to the door.  The space is really cute it reminded me of a European alley.  The food and the decor make it highly Instagram-able too.   \n\nWe arrived around 9 AM most days and there was either no line or one person ahead of us.  Though I felt like every time we sat down a line formed behind us quickly.  It seems it is a popular place to have a quick work meeting as a lot of people had computers with them.\n\nA lot on the menu interested me however I went with the avocado toast every morning.  Add a fried egg on top for an extra burst of flavor (and protein).  M-F you can order more items and the weekend is brunch only fewer menu items but you get a small coffee and orange juice with your meal.  I also had the mint lemonade and it was so good that I sucked it down before my food arrived.  Granted the glass was pretty small but still highly recommend getting one for yourself next time you visit.  Tap water is free located on the wall near the back.\n\nMy friend got the salmon on a bagel and the chia bowl during one of her meals and enjoyed them both equally.  I wish I would've tried more but when you are on vacation and find something that not only fills you up but its super tasty I tend to not experiment.  I really can't say enough about the avocado toast it was so dang good tangy avocado with a thick slice of bread and an egg if desired feta cheese sunflower seeds sprouts and cherry tomatoes topped off the deliciousness.  Avocado. Toast. Get. It.\n\nWe both said that we will be booking our hotel next time based on proximity to Gotan.\n\nThank you for keeping us full and happy during our trip!" u"I finally tried Gotan today after bookmarking it for a while.  We showed up right at noon and there was no line and plenty of seats around.  You can choose to take out or eat in in which they give you a table and serve you directly.  I would suggest coming early if you're looking to get a seat as the place got pretty crowded as time passed.. though most people seemed to be coming in to pick up lunch to bring back to their offices.\n\nWe had an assortment of items from the menu:\n\n- Avocado toast - wow that was one major heaping pile of avocado smash on a delicious thick slice of bread.  Delicious and slightly tangy.  Probably my favorite dish of the bunch aside from the chia bowl.  This is a must get at Gotan and I'm not even a fan of avocado toast since it's easily made (and much cheaper) at home.\n\n- Tuna and avocado salad - I liked the dressing and the avocado and the little baby toasts they give you but sadly I was not a fan of the tuna salad.  I'm just not really a fan of tuna salad to begin with and I just didnt think it went well with the rest of the salad.  It's good if you think tuna salad and avocado go together or just really like tuna salad but this was not for me.\n\n- Chia bowl - yum!  It was so many different flavors and textures and not too sweet.  Also something you can easily make at home but all the yummy toppings on this one made it worth trying.\n\n- Lentil and chicken soup - this was literally the biggest bowl of soup for $7 ever.  I would suggest sharing this with someone as it's quite huge and would probably be a lot for one person.  Also high in the sodium as are most soups from restaurants.\n\n- Hot coffee - strong and not burnt.\n\nNot the cheapest weekday lunch meal but definitely unique and worth a try if you're in the Midtown East area.  Makes for some pretty Instagram pictures too.  Come early!" u"Loved this place!  To the extent that it became the go to breakfast place for our entire trip. The location was perfect as it was right next to our hotel and the service was always friendly/helpful but the food is what kept us coming back.  Everything was tasty and filling.  My favorite was the Salmon Bialey (Salmon on a bagel) with the Avocado Toast coming in a VERY close second.  I tried the Chia bowl one day as well and that was also good.\n\nCan't wait to find this place again on my next NY adventure!"],0.3382,0.094,0.906,0.0
142.99 Cent Fresh Pizza,[u"Despite the economical price the cheese pizza here is actually pretty good. 99cents per slice of cheese or $2.75 for two slice and can soda. \n\nTheres like 5 bottles of condiments you can top it with; garlic powder hot sauce chilli powder and some other stuff I am not sure what they are. \n\nTrust me this place is worth a try.\n\nI always questioned why people get cheese pizza and not other toppings but it was good enough that I didn't think the need for additional toppings. Cheese alone was good enough. Especially knowing that it was $1. \n\nFYI. I had to eat 4 pieces and 2 soda to feel satisfied though (not full satisfied). I'm not that fat... I think" u"Looking for a cheap slice? This is the place! Walked in here with a dollar and happily through it for some cheese pizza. I had low expectations because of how cheap it is but it tasted good. The crust was a bit soft like a flatbread but the cheese-sauce ratio is good. \n\nService was quick and the portion is a good sized slice. Not the best pizza but definitely the best value I've ever had. Honestly I'm impressed!\n\nFood: 3.5/5\nService: 4/5\nValue: 6/5 (yes it broke my rating system)\nOverall: 4.5/5" u"It feels weird writing a review about a 99c pizza joint -- kind of like writing your trusty bodega a review? But I felt compelled to point out how this one stands out. Staff is super friendly. They've got the 2 slices + drink for $2.75 deal and they're insanely quick. I come here a lot and have never gotten a cold slice. Most days the lines are out the door but it takes 5 minutes tops. I walk in hand them a dollar and head back to my office.\n\nCan't go wrong with that." u'This is literally 99 cents! Be warned though they only take cash!! Thankfully I had exactly $2 on me but if they accepted card I would have purchase more slices! Keep in mind its 99 cents so dont expect something amazing and over the top. That being said the slice WAS good. The crust was crunchy (which I love but I know some people prefer pizza that folds up). I would definitely return here for a cheap nighttime bit when I return to NY.' u"Everything about 99 Cent Fresh Pizza is quick and satisfying. You walk in you toss a buck and you get a solid slice of pizza. Just one dollar and then you get your za. Is this the best piece of pizza I've ever had? No. Can it compete with really good slices of pizza? Not really. But is it an incredible deal and one of the best bangs-for-my-buck that I've ever experienced? Absolutely.\n\nThe slice itself had a standard airy crust not much to write home about but still met my standards. Sauce to cheese ratio was nailed which is often what makes or breaks a slice of pizza if you ask me. Leopard spotting on the cheese made for a nice smokey flavor while I blotted the excess oil to make it a little easier on my gut. You can't beat an instant solid slice for a buck in New York plus their $2.75 two slice and drink combo is a big win for anyone who goes that route." u"I'd definitely be back.  For a little over $2 you can get two slices of pizza and a drink. They are open late so even when you are wandering around slightly buzzed back to your hotel you can get a piece of New York City. I haven't had a chance to compare other pizzerias as I am from out of town but this is what I picture real New York City Pizza being like. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and my pizza was delicious!" u'$5.01 for 5 slices!?! I stepped back.\n\nCheese slices are a great go to after a fancy meal where each of us dropped way way more than a Washington. Hot sauce and garlic available in handy and nonhandy squeeze bottles.\n\nA New York tradition fold your slice.' u"What a great business model! The advertising and price point is in the name of the business! And if not obvious despite the low price point profits are made up with the endless foot traffic in Times Square. Don't surprised if there is a line at this 24-hour joint.\n\nHow's the quality you ask? For 99 cents the pizza is definitely worth it. Toppings are 50 cents extra and the slice will take a little longer to prepare for you since they need to add the topping and warm it up. If you don't want to wait give the man a dollar for a constantly produced cheese slice and be on your way living your busy New York life.\n\nIf you're in a time crunch before watching a Broadway show (like I was) stop at 99 Cent Fresh Pizza to fill your stomach--then eat something better after the show!" u"Given the high costs of living in NYC I'm amazed dollar pizza is a concept around the city. It's an unassuming pizza shop near Times Sq with little seating - the intent is to get in and get out. The cheese pizza is 99 cents and for an additional 50 cents you can add a topping to your slice (pepperoni mushroom pineapple etc). They even have a deal where for $2.70 you can get 2 slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda - there's a good variety of soda in that fridge (pineapple Fanta Welch's grape soda etc.)\n\nThis place was right across from my hotel so I visited twice and both times the slices came from a fresh pizza from the oven. And they were hot! The way they do toppings is pretty clever - if you ask for pepperoni they take a slice of the cheese throw like 5 slices of pepperoni and toss it back into the oven to reheat. It doesn't really dry out the pizza as there's enough grease to keep it from being dry. =P\n\nIt's not the greatest pizza but it's pretty good for what it is - hence the 5 stars. Definitely better than pizza from 7/11 or Little Caesar's - the crust is thin enough that it's pretty tasty. It's great they let you add toppings - there's the usual oregano parmesan cheese and red pepper... but they also have garlic powder which was really nice to throw on my slice. Also the pizza isn't super filling so a quick slice makes for a good snack.\n\nOpen 24/7 it makes for a great late night meal in the city especially since they're so close to Times Square! I really enjoyed it and there seem to be plenty of locals who stop by for a dirt cheap bite." u"You know what? This place has fresh pizza and it's 99 cents so it is true Tony's name! I popped in here to grab a slice of cheese which had just come out of the oven. They have a variety of pop and also bottled water for $1.00-1.50. You can get two slices and a drink for $2.75 which is crazy cheap. You're not getting any rustic white pomodoro pizza if you're coming here but really--you knew that already. They're open 24 hours and it's easy to hop\nin and out!" u'My husband and I were staying down the street from this place so on our way back from grand central station we decided to grab a late night quick and cheap slice of pizza. Every time we passed this place we would see people going in and out so figured the pizza was always fresh and it definitely was! For a $1 this is the best bang for your buck! The pizza was greasy but it was gooey and crispy. Even the pizza sauce was delicious. We were so glad we gave it a try. We even decided to come back again the next night (stuffed after a huge dinner) to get some more and there were no regrets :D' u"You can't beat an 18 inch pizza pie for $8. When it's fresh and hot from the oven after you've been walking the streets for like an hour... it's like the best pit stop for food. \n\nThey're quick the pizza is simple. \n\nNot much else to say. A go to spot if you want pizza that's cheap and simple. No frills pizza!" u"Kinda weird to write a review about a fast food/hole-in-the-wall type of place but its worth mentioning. I randomly walked by this place for a quick bite after work and was surprised to find that there was actually quite a line up outside. They had a great deal- 2 slices and a pop for 2.75 and since normally restaurants in NYC are usually way more expensive - I wasn't expecting much to be honest. However I was very pleasantly surprised! Pizza was being made fresh as we ordered and it was actually delicious! I got 2 cheese slices and topped it off with some hot sauce parmesan cheese garlic powder and some oregano- amazing! Its a great place to just quickly grab a bite to eat and be on your way. The crust was decent - not too crispy or too soft. A good amount of sauce and cheese- super yummy and super fast!" u"This is my favorite dollar pizza. I've tried other places but I stick with this one.\n\nFor $2.75 you can get the combo: 2 slices of plain pizza and a can of soda or bottle of water. \n\nI really recommend this dollar pizza. They are fats and the pizza is always hot and they add a lot of cheese." u"When reviewing any restaurant the review has to take into account the price as well as the  food quality and taste. Here you can get a slice for $1 or 2 slices with a can of soda for only $2.75. That get 5 stars in my book. Some people seek out the highest mountains to climb the most scenic byways to drive or the most thrilling roller coasters to ride. My thrill is to find the cheapest food deals. This is on top of the list. For what you pay for 2 slices and a can of soda here would be the exact price you would pay in almost any other NYC pizza place for just a single slice. So anyone complaining about this place would be akin to paying $5 for a cross country cab ride from LA to NYC and then being upset that the cab didn't stop directly in front of your house but on the corner instead.\n\nIt's open 24 hours so you can satisfy your cheapskate cravings even in your sleep. No the pizza isn't going to be on display in the Museum of Excellent Food but it's more than tasty. It's not just tasty for $.99 cents but it's tasty period. Since this place is constantly busy your pizza will most likely be fresh especially if you come during lunch hour. My only knock is that it could use more sauce. No place to sit here just 2 standing room counters that might fit 4 people standing up each and that's if each person is of normal weight and keeps their elbows down while holding their slice. You have to fight for the spices on one of the counters and if you can find napkins you've found the rarest characters in Pokemon Go.\n\nSo come here for the pizza. Mostly come here and get your cheapskate on. Your face will glow when you think you got over on these guys for paying so little for your food. The only thing that would make me happier than this deal is when a certain President of the U.S. gets impeached.  It will almost make you feel guilty that you are so darn cheap and giving them so little money but then you are reminded that being a cheapskate means never having to say you're sorry." u'When I am visiting this place I feel myself not as a client but a gangster robbing those guys by giving $0.99 for a decent slice of yummy pizza. In the are the prices of food are ridiculously high - one needs $10 - $15 for a lunch or breakfast. But this restaurant managed to keep the prices under the radar. So low - for $275 I can take two slices of hot cheese pizza plus a can of soda. The topping is $0.50 per slice. As far as I know this is one of the cheapest place in Manhattan. Well that explains is overcrowded. Fortunately the line is moving fast. Actually the whole service is pretty fast and the staff is friendly. \nMaybe the biggest pron is that this place works 24/7. They offer no fancy dishes or gourmet - only pizza and drinks. As drawback could mention they accept cash only. \nI tried to pay with e-wallet but this is not an option here.' u"99cent thin crusted pizza with minimal cheese and sauce. Add topping for 50cent. Definitely cheap eats for when you are on the go or on a budget. The place has no seating. They are open 24/7 and that's probably the reason why staff are so grumpy. Not a place if you are looking for good customer service. Nothing too spectacular but pizza does come out of the oven fresh because a lot of people come to order it." u"I was staying at a hotel just a few buildings down from this place and I was really bummed that I didn't have more NY pizza before my last day in New York. Luckily 99 Cent Fresh Pizza is open 24/7 so I was able to come get one last slice super early in the morning before I headed to the airport. I got one slice with mushrooms and sausage they were able to pop it in the oven to crisp up the edges and crust. It was so bomb and so cheap! Definitely wished I ate here at least once every day that I was visiting NY." u'Tasted like Ellios pizza but better.  Its 99cent pizza what are you expecting' u"Cheap oily pizza with surprisingly little sauce. Get ready for the grease to drip down your elbows because this is a minimalist joint without a napkin in sight. That being said it's filling and tasty for a great price. If you're looking for a quick bite you can't beat it especially in the wee hours of the morning."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
53.Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant,[u'I only hold the fondest memories for Buca. I\'ve been numerous times in both Michigan and Atlantic City. Not really in Midtown when there are so many great options for Italian food in this city. But yes it\'s better than just a fancy family style huge Olive Garden. One of my greatest memories is going to one that eventually closed down in Birmingham Mich. We\'d order a basket of wine I\'d have two sips and state how much I hate alcohol (my how things have changed) we\'d share a bunch of food until we felt uncomfortably full and pile back into the car. Mom would be in her \'moment\' at this point after probably only one glass. One particular time she screamed at the top of her lungs at a prime moment when one of her favorite songs The Shangri-La\'s "The Leader of the Pack" came on "LOOK OUT LOOK OUT LOOK OUT LOOK OUT!" causing my Dad to scream "WHAT?!" and slam on his brakes in a panic. This followed with the three of us kids busting out laughing to the point where tears were streaming down my face. Only Buca\'s can invoke that kind of spirit.\n\nMy first visit to the one in Midtown didn\'t fail to impress. The staff was amazing. How can you hate on a restaurant that does \'BUILD YOUR OWN PASTA?!\' You can now adjust a family size (I\'m serious about the portion sizes here - meant for 2-3 people at least) and add whatever the hell you want to whatever pasta you\'re feeling. Pink sauce alfredo garlic olive oil marinara pesto meat sauce add on an array of vegetables pick a meat (even prosciutto is in there) and boom. \n\nOther things to order - calamari - surprisingly quite good for a chain. Cheesy Florentine Bread that has like alfredo sauce and spinach slathered on - do it. Garlic bread - do it. One or the other because both might be over kill. Meatballs - the size of your head. No explanation necessary. The Salmon Sorrento - Bizarrely one of my favorite dishes I\'ve tried here. The garlic butter sauce and the salmon was so tender and juicy. They also serve an impressive Colossal Sundae Brownie desert in a giant martini glass that again is for like a party of ten so come with a huge group and try everything.' u"So many cheese pulls! I had an outstanding meal Buca Di Beppo. Part of that was the delicious food part of that was the excellent company I had during the meal but more than either of those was the outstanding customer service received. \n\nServing our group of 10 people with as much food as we ordered and all the running around staging photos was no easy task. Didn't matter to our servers especially Sade. She was on top of every need and request. \n\nI'd eat there again and again. The giant meatballs and make your own pasta is the way to go." u'We arrived on a Saturday right when they opened there doors we were there second table to be seated. Our server was JJ nice customer service. It was just my husband and myself we first received bread before ordering bread was dry and seemed stale tasting. In an establishment like this kind of place you bread should come out fresh warm and tasting homemade. \n\nFYI-This is a family style restaurant- small serves around 3 people\n\nWe  ordered the Small- Baked Rigatoni ( spicy Italian sausage and meat sauce tossed and topped with mozzarella Parmesan and ricotta). Pasta was cooked perfect and dish had nice flavor.' u'It was a pretty good experience but I would probably not go back. It\'s probably good for younger kids the interior decoration is kind of tacky and overdone (but hey it\'s Times Square!) Some of the drinks are pretty good and the food is pretty good too but kind of overpriced even if they call it "family style". However portions are generous. We got the lasagna and fried mozzerella and it was good but I felt like it was built for the average American palette--\n same flavors just tomato cheese and carbs nothing special. Personally New York has so many better Italian restaurants than this and I would not recommend it unless you have a family.' u'This was our only Italian restaurant that we ate while we were in New York and it did not disappoint! The portions are different because they are all for families. No individual plates. We got the spicy chicken pasta and it was really really really good! Overall the experience was grrrrrreat!!' u'Perfectly cooked and tasty pasta. Quantity was huge. We ordered small pasta plate which serve 3-2 people and buca cocktails. But their bread was not good at all. It was salty. Restaurant can improve on it or customer can escape it' u"We've been to Buca di Beppo in other locations and it's been okay.  There were only three of us so basically we were only able to order things that satisfied one or two of us.  Sometimes this chain has options other than large family style dishes but not here.  I was left with the basic impression of yuck." u'Stopped in for a late lunch on a Monday. We were a party of nine and received excellent service from the beginning. Al was our server he was very attentive and welcoming. Food was good portions are large. Loved the feel of the restaurant very authentic.' u"Came to here because I have a coupon: free small paste. Oder it as take out and wait for about 15 minutes. The small paste actually is 3 people portion and I can't finished by myself. They even give me the free bread. Happy with this meal and will come back with friends." u'We ate at Buca for lunch on a trip to NYC.  We were hoping to find an Italian restaurant close to Times Square and found this.  We enjoyed our food we got separate dishes even though they offer "family style".  The food was good but the service was even better.  Our server was Nahid and he took care of us the entire time!  The only disappointment was that the garlic bread was like $13.00  and should be priced more like $4.99 for what we received.' u'Had a reservation before going to the theatre. Immediately seated after we wondered around checking out the decor!!  All went well with suggestions from our waitress- so we thought. We landed up getting an extra entree!  When we told the waitress she said "just keep it it\'s on the house".  Had a wonderful shrimp pasta dish and equally delicious antipasto salad -- both very large (even though we ordered the small) and enough to feed 4. \nWe got antsy waiting for our check and the waitress apologized telling us they were serving a party of 90. Explaining that we had a time commitment she did expedite the bill and we made it to see Lion King in a timely manner  \nSo overall very good but not a five star. In spite of the few snafus I definitely would recommend going!!  Be hungry and you\'ll be satisfied' u"Bucca is my favorite happy hour spot in the city. The happy hour is only available in the bar area but it's always a good time. Cheap food and alcohol you've caught my attention. The bartender Jerry is a sweetheart and I always have a good time when I visit. Looking for a nice happy hour spot before a show hit this place up." u'Visited this place last nightMy friends and I had a hard time getting a table (staff was not the greatest at welcoming our group seems like they were not sure or simply ideally wanted to take family groups instead)We decided to seat at the bar after the host told us it would be 20 extra minutes previously we were told 8pm it was 8:07pm and we were not seated yet. Once at the bar we were warmly welcomed by ALYSSA the only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars (food was good enough not the best I had). She was amazing we saw an empty table that NO ONE WAS USING and asked ALYSSA if we could take it (we did tell her that we were waiting for that specific table just to make the process seamless). She happily helped us transfer to an actual dining table and  treated us with exceptional customer service. \n\nWe were very uncomfortable and felt bad when we heard the manager ( maybe his name is RICH) yelling at her for giving us the table when she was simply taking care of us when no one else cared to do so. This is public humiliation towards staff for unnecessary reasons I run a business and would never handle one of my team members the way that he did. I simply wrote the email for ALYSSA most likely I will visit the bar if she is there when I come by.' u"5 Stars for an awesome happy hour! I was seeing a Broadway show that was literally next door...had 1.5 hours to kill and needed a drink so I decided to give this place a shot. So glad I did!  They have a nice spacious bar area an great deals on food and drinks until 7pm. My friend and I had a couple of apps and I had a couple of drinks. I think our total was around $30...we were both stuffed and I was buzzed enough to sit through a play and actually enjoyed it. \n\nIf this place wasn't situated in the epicenter of hell aka Times Square I would come here way more often. Next time I find myself in that neck of the woods around happy hour time I will gladly stop in. \n\nBartender was super nice and funny too always a plus in my book!\n\nLooking for a place in the hood? Def check it out but I have dibs on a barstool!" u"The food was good here. That is the best I can say. The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived still it took ten minutes for our waiter to arrive and take our order. 20 minutes later (we hadn't even been given water yet) the waiter came back out to take our order again because he had lost it. A manager never came out to apologize or say anything. The server then never came back to ask about the food. The service was not worth the price." u"I know it is sacrilege to a) admit to liking a tourist place like this and b) go to Times Square at ALL if you are a NYC resident...but I really really love it here.  Even to the point where even though I have a birthday right around Christmas I would consider having it here (I guess I like masochism but that's besides the point).  I've literally never seen it busy here when it's adjacent to a place like Planet Hollywood and a few blocks from the Hard Rock.  Another thing I think that works in its favor: Carmine's get the rep.  I've never been to Carmine's because I like to keep my sanity in check.  People who have been to Carmine's though...prefer Buca!\n\nAnyway you can't really go wrong here if you love Italian food or pasta.  And who doesn't love pasta?! (bad if you're gluten free to low-carbing though).\n\nHubby and I usually split a large portion bring the leftovers home.  Favorites include penne san remo chicken and sausage ziti shrimp pomodoro...and standards like spaghetti and meatballs.  All good all good.  Large feeds about 5-6.  Small 2-3.\n\nWe did the create your own pasta once and the only thing we were disappointed in was the pesto sauce.  Not very heavy on the basil which was disappointing.  \n\nTheir drinks and desserts are also HUGE.  The brownie sundae...we've never gotten it but have seen it several times.  It's HUGE.  You probably need about four people to eat it without you know dying.  Their Sicilian margarita is awesome.  Really it's well worth trying even if you live here." u'We were seated at a table in a corner by a pole. After asking for a new table and even offering to wait. In order for anybody to walk by they had to bump our table and servers with dirty dishes would have to cross the dishes over our table to get out of the room. \n\nI ordered a draft beer from the bar but was told there was no draft beer today. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. \n\nOur food came out before our drinks were even brought to the table. \n\nThe pasta and bread were average at best. The pasta was over cooked and the bread was dry and seemed stale tasting. \n\nOur server was great. He kept trying to make it a good experience. None of our problems were his fault.' u"Worst birthday experience at Bucca di Beppo by far. Because the waitress was horrible. I have been at Bucca many times and had celebrated bday at Bucca before multiple times. But this time was truly the worst. The waitress was not attentive and disappeared for most of our service. We even had to wait so long to get our checks to pay the bill. Suffice it to say we did not even celebrate our birthdays (mine and my bro's). Because the waitress did not come. So after waiting 45 to one hr  we decided not even to order the dessert for the birthdays. And did not even bother. This experience deter me from coming to this restaurant again. I dont think I will be coming back to this branch again. Other branches are okay. But this one with today's experience is the worst. \n\nEdited: our table was not the only table that complain of the horrible service. The two tables near ours the people also complained and said to us that today waitress service was the worst they ever had. And they couldn't wait to leave. But what piss me off the most was the waitress had the audacity to complain to another waiter that our tip was little. She should be glad we gave her a tip at all. Because she truly did not deserve any tip. She was lucky I did not hear her smirk remark to her colleague. My brother heard it. I was this close to complaining to the manager about her since he was near the front of the restaurant.  Had I heard her remark I would had 100% complained and she would probably had been reprimanded. Worst waitress whom my brother-in-law said it best she was clueless. Like as if it's her first day being a waitress altogether. Just plain disgusting.\n\nThis review should only get one star the second star was for the food. Food today was okay. I remember it being better. Yup bad bday experience for bro me and my whole family." u"Love this place! I've been here twice and both times the food and drinks were delicious! Yes the portions are amazingly huge but which Italian restaurant's isn't? \n\nI just don't understand how a location in Times Square can be so empty. Maybe it's just my luck but both times I've been here have been very quiet. Although I actually appreciated to be away from all the noise Times Square is known for... I just found it to be bizarre." u"Given that this restaurant is in the middle of Times Square expect there to be a lot of tourists families and little kids. A group of 6 other people and I made a reservation and we were seated after only a few minutes of waiting. The waiting area was packed and crowded with people. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. \n\nDo not come here for super authentic handmade Italian food!! The food was pricy and quality average. You could definitely get better Italian food somewhere else in the city for a much better price. But that was what I expected assuming that it's main business is tourist-type.  However the portions were quite big and the restaurant made family-sharing style incredibly easy. The restaurant ambiance was also warm and welcoming and the decorations reminded me of Christmas (in a good way) with all the lights colors and friendliness. After eating all our food which took a good 45 minutes we ordered a dessert sundae for my friend's birthday. They sang a cute fun song to him which was nice and made all of us pretty happy. The huge sundae was as good as it looks (which is VERY good) and was shared between us 7 people... it was STILL a struggle to finish. We were SO full.\n\nEven after eating most of our food we stayed in our booth for another hour and a half talking laughing and nibbling on the small food we had left. We didn't get ANY warning or harsh looks to leave even though we stayed for a really long time lol (2.5 hours total). Overall although the food was not great the restaurant friendliness was awesome. I also really liked how the food was geared towards family sharing.\n**we came here in late December at about 7 or 8 o'clock so that may be the reason why so many people were there."],0.4754,0.091,0.909,0.0
163.Jacob’s Pickles,[u'Best breakfast Food In Manhattan! Food Coma Warning! \n\nGreat service Madina the girl from Africa was super friendly I think she may have been a manager I am not sure. She really took a liking to Donna for some reason and they even took a picture together! \n\nI ordered the most awesome plate of pancakes with chicken and bacon! it was absolutely huge and the chicken was somehow marvelously flavored to melt in my mouth! Hence my claim of warning about FOOD COMAS! \n\nI am a pretty big guy and big eater and I actually could not finish the last couple of bites of my pancakes so its a great serving! \n\nThis place is also a full bar and I would imagine has food after breakfast too. \n\nThis is my favorite manhattan spot now for a good feeding!' u'My friends took me here for my birthday dinner and it was cool. When we arrived the wait time was about a hour because apparently this place is ALWAYS packed and they just opened back up after a fire happened a while ago. The girl at the front took our number to call us when the table was ready so we didn\'t have to wait in the cold outside. We decided to have drinks at a place next door because they do all day happy hour. After a while we realized no one called us so we strolled on over back to the restaurant and the girl said she took our number down wrong...so right there was a strike for me because she definitely took the number down correctly she just forgot to call to tell us our table was ready and it was already super late which was a tad bit annoying. \n\nLet\'s just get straight to the food. It is very heavy and decadent!! They make down south comfort food and I must say I enjoyed it. It\'s usually not my normal go to style of food but I wasn\'t disappointed at all. I ordered fried pickles and the friend chicken with mushrooms in gravy that was laid on top of a huge biscuit. There is no way in hell you can finish that "sandwich" in one sitting! It was a monster! The biscuit had a light layer of honey brushed across the top and it was so good! After literally three bites I was full. The fried pickles were amazing too and it was paired with some type of chipotle aioli. The only issue I had with that appetizer: It was only about five pickles!! And for the price it definitely should\'ve been more in the bowl. To drink I ordered one of their cocktails that was pretty good too. My friends ordered the meat loaf and one of the other fried chicken sandwiches. \n\nNow dessert...they told the waitress it was my birthday so they came out with a pumpkin pie in a skillet and ice cream on top and of course with a sparkler! That was nice and the dessert was really good too I couldn\'t believe how smooth the ice cream was. I assumed they made the ice cream at the restaurant because the consistency and flavor was excellent and seemed fresh in my opinion. The pumpkin pie was smooth too! I was really impressed by the pie because the pumpkin flavor wasn\'t over powering. I would try this place again because I seen one or two things on the menu I would like to try but it isn\'t a place I would come to regularly...I\'m pretty sure I gained 10 pounds after that dinner lol.' u"BULLSH*T!!!\n\nFirst off I'd like to say that I love this place. I have been coming here since the first week they were open. I love the food. I love the drinks. I love the service and the ambiance and everything. This place has it all.\n\nBUT- unless you are a large party of 6 or more they don't give a sh*t about you. \n\nI came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend for date night. We wanted some good food and good drinks and immediately thought of Jacob's Pickles. For me autumn means comfort food and there isn't much more comforting than this place.\n\nWe realized that since it was a Friday night there would be a wait. Fine. It's NYC. We were quoted a 25 minutes wait and gave our number and went next door for a drink. At 45 minutes we checked-in to see what the hold-up was and were told that there were a lot of large parties and that there were still 3 people ahead of us. Even though there were 3 open two-tops. We were told we could be seated immediately if we wanted outside. We said yes and they then proceeded to ignore us again. \n\nAt 1 hour (remember we were quoted 25 minutes) we checked-in again visibly annoyed. They apologized and said 5 minutes. And then we're ignored again.\n\nAt 1 hour and 20 minutes a full 55 minutes after our quoted wait time we stood and stared angrily at the hostess until she acknowledged us and apologized and sat us finally. \n\nAfter that the service was great and the food was great.\nBut until they update their reservation system to allow small parties or actually value people who want to eat at their restaurant I say f*ck this place. Bad form." u"A solid and super popular joint for brunch and solid Southern fried things. Inside track - they open way early; those who like breakfast should head this way to avoid crowds. Don't miss the fried chicken & pancakes. Me and my friends have enjoyed this place a lot. We'll be coming back for sure!" u"Won the lottery - no wait to sit outside on a Sunday night. WHAT. How glorious. The atmosphere is extremely trendy and classy great for dates with your boo with hip-hop music playing with gold lights and mirrors all around. Looks like a real standout place. \n\nOrdered the meatballs appetizer honey chicken sandwich and the meatloaf. Food takes forever to arrive which is the reason I took away a star. It's damn near torture! Well the meatballs appetizer was great. Comes in a skillet with tomato sauce and cheese. The entrees were delicious. I highly recommend both! If you want a sweet dish get the honey chicken. Comes with grits and super soft biscuits. The menu is interesting as it combines Jewish food with southern and does it so well. JP's is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city." u"Our server warned us that the portions are large. All of the restaurants we've been to have said that the portions weren't even large at all.\n\nWe ordered the Croque Madame and pancakes with fried chicken. When the pancakes came out my mom dropped! Never have I seen that large of pancakes! \n\nThe Croque Madame came out on a hot pan all the flavors melted in my mouth the cheese biscuits eggs and hams all in one. \n\nThe pancakes with crumbled bacon bites on it was also a winner. The syrup was dark and didn't taste like the generic store bought one. \n\nThe employees and manager was really friendly. Madina came to check on us right after we ordered food. So we couldn't say how the food was yet. She chatted with us for a bit and she even gave us a ice cream bread pudding on the house! Her name is Madina. I will definitely come back here again." u"Be ready for a baby food coma and waiting for brunch at 1-2 hours if you want to come at prime time on the weekends. If your party is 6+ they will accept reservations. Be smart and go before 10am or after 1pm or get a large group w/ reservations together. \n\nThis is heavy southern comfort and for a food city like NYC - there aren't that many places that will even stack up to Biscuit Head or Bojangles (yes I said it!) in NC or Fried Chicken and Catfish from SC and GA. But Jacob does a pretty damn good job.\n\nThings to Do:\n1)Split entrees. They are large especially if you want some appetizers \n2)Fried Honey Chicken w biscuits and cheesy grits\n3)Pickles\n4)Bloody-Marys and any cocktail. DO NOT be that basic and just get a MIMOSA\n5)If you get a salad to pretend to make yourself feel better get the caesar with fried chicken or the kale w/ shrimp. \n6)Vegetarians be aware that a lot of the collard greens/greens use pork-fat\n7)Pass on the Matzo Ball Soup and Catfish Tacos\n8)Decent but not spectacular devil eggs\n\nIf you need something different from the traditional brunch spots in NYC come grab a piece of the south at JP's." u"Undoubtedly hands down no questions asked one of the most delicious and indulgent meal of my life. After way too much anticipation I came here with a dear friend for her birthday (that is my only critique; they completely forgot to address her birthday despite me asking the manager in advance for some sort of candle acknowledgement!! Very unfortunate) and we had a lovely time. \n\nOur server Cory was so so passionate and excited to recommend his personal favorites. With much help we finally decided on the skillet of Mac n Cheese the Fried Honey Chicken Biscuit and the Turkey leg--all washed down by Jam Jar cocktails and sour pickles. \n\nI'll let the pictures do the talking but the portions were so decadent and filling...the leftovers were plentiful! Every single item was simply the most delicious bite. We agreed after much deliberation that the biscuit won first place followed by the Mac as a close second. \n\nMuch to my delight the cost wasn't too crazy at all! Although they did have us pay right there via iPad which I found to be awkward. \n\nI am still dreaming of the pickle spears and expansive cocktail menu. Do yourself a big favor and head over--it's such a romantic vibe too." u"Our favorite spot. Jacob is here every night & is more than happy to talk to every table. We've tried & enjoyed everything on the menu. Great beer selection. Service is outstanding. Everything very delicious. the presentation of the bloody Mary is epic. The biscuit French toast and fried pickles were great. Always expect a wait here! LOL!" u"I get it. I get what all the fuss is about. I'd been craving chicken & waffles for the last few months and finally decided on Jacob's to satisfy my food baby (shall we name her Martha?). I wasn't aware of the fire incident that left Jacob's indefinitely closed since March but thankfully they re-opened a few days prior to when I went\u4e00Lucky me!\n\nAs a first timer I opted for 'Honey Chicken & Pickles' and it was a solid choice. The buttermilk fried chicken was succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside. The clover honey though seemingly a bit heavy handed at first soaks its way into the southern biscuit like a sponge! It becomes such a soft and delightful treat as you're nearing the end of your meal. I wouldn't call this a sandwich as the biscuit is way too soft and fragile to even pick up let alone encompass a hefty portion of fried chicken. The cheese grits though placed unassumingly to the side is fabulous especially when dipped with the biscuit chicken hot sauce even the pickles! The 'Sprecher Root Beer' paired well with my entree and was just what I needed. Vanilla-y caramel-y a classy glass of fine root beer.\n\nHuge portions good value. A smashing selection of beer on tap. I'll definitely be back to try other chicken and waffle variations and preferably with a group because their pickled goods have a great crunch and are saliva-inducing masterpieces. \n\nP.S. This place gets loud so it's not great for holding conversations." u"Literally my new favorite restaurant and I can't believe it's so far from LA! When I originally found this place I Yelp I knew I had to go since I was in NYC and I life for Mac & Cheese. I went on a Sunday afternoon so I assumed most people would be watching football. Wrong. It was absolutely packed! With loud music. At first I was off put for sure. We were sat at a community table basically squished. We saw some people leave at a four top table and asked to move. At first they said no but later came back and let us switch. It was super nice and changed the whole experience for us (for the better)!\n\nWe ordered the dill pickles pickle slaw mushroom mac & cheese and the hot chicken biscuit sandwich. \n\nThe mushroom mac & cheese was incredible! Very cheesy but not too rich at all and the mushrooms were so flavorful. I shared with my sister and it was plenty. The boyfriends said they loved the hot chicken sandwich but they said it couldn't be called a sandwich. The bottom side of the biscuit was inedible because it was soaked in hot sauce. The slaw was normal coleslaw with pickles added (brilliant)! \n\nThe drinks were less exciting than the food and not worth $12 IMO but still good! You have to go here!" u"I give this place a strong 4.5. \n\nI came on a Tuesday evening around 6p and there were a decent number of people there but still a few open tables. No wait? Woohoo! \n\nThe wait staff is very friendly and helpful. When waiting for the bathroom I had 4 employees tell me there's more bathrooms downstairs if I didn't want to wait. \n\nI've heard great things about this place and they certainly delivered (overall). \n\nI got:\n\nBiscuits with sausage gravy: bomb diggidy! This was delicious. The sausage gravy was rich and meaty and the biscuit was nice and crisp. They don't make their biscuits fluffy but I still like them! ($11)\n\nPickled thyme jalape\xf1os: these were very mild. I expected a bit more of a kick but it wasn't like that at all. I still liked them ($4)\n\nChicken and pancakes: can you say bomb.com? These were dynamite and the portion was huge! My friend and I had enough leftovers for a few meals. The pancakes were fluffy the chicken crisp and the bacon sprinkled on top was divine. Their maple syrup is a great addition. ($17)\n\nCheesy grits: I've heard people rave about these but I wasn't a fan. They topped it off with cheese so I definitely got that flavor. Overall it felt a bit weak in terms of flavor. I love grits but could do without this next time. ($6)\n\nOverall I'm glad I came. I'm also glad this place isn't outside my doorstep otherwise I'd become an oompa loompa. Because yes it's that good." u'Do not over order you will leave ten pounds heavier and needing a nap with some turmeric tea. \nWe had to wait 38 minutes once our name was on the list which went quick since there are clothing stores nearby. The vibe is electric with music from the 2010s. The waiter had great suggestions and the lemonade tasted fresh. The Buffalo Mac and Cheese was a great mix of different cheeses a classic blu cheese and chicken that crunched when bit like it was just taken off the stove. The Honey chicken with pickles had a side of grits and cornbread below. If you got a bite with each item from that plate the flavors of sweet sour and a bit of spice mixed incredibly well. \nCannot wait to workout for two weeks before I can physically come back and eat it again.' u"Are we supposed to be honest when waitstaff checks on you after meal is delivered and patron has had a taste of it? I didn't want to tell staff that the 6-hour Short Rib was too salty for me to enjoy it. I tried eating it along with the seemingly unseasoned mashed potatoes and honey-glazed carrots which lost its glaze in the mashed potatoes. \n\nIn my opinion the mashed potatoes should've been served in a ramekin and carrots on the side of the short rib.\n\nMy friend ordered the Chicken & Pancakes topped with it's special bacon and maple syrup. That looked delicious. Also they give you a bottle of Molasses Maple Syrup to pour on top of your food.  Imo you don't need extra syrup of any kind. The Pancakes were real sweet like you're eating dessert. Though I didn't try the chicken but it looked beautifully battered and cooked.\n\nTo drink I sampled 3 beers to figure out which one I wanted. I gave up and blindly ordered the Hudson Bourbon Peach Tea. Bourbon was the predominant flavor in the tea second is peach flavor. Tasted a bit like summer.\n\nThe one item I'd like to come back for is its Biscuit Bread Pudding. Judging by the photos it looks scrumptious and huge. I'd like that with a cup of coffee." u'Felt right at home from the moment I stepped in this establishment.  It was like I was dining at a restaurant in (North Park) San Diego.  The vibe in here.... somewhat lax and hipster\'ish.  They specialize in southern style food.\n\nCame in for brunch and ordered the "Biscuits French Toast" with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar.  The Hubby ordered the "Coop Platter" which is basically a platter consisting of a little bit of everything (3 eggs bacon sausage grits biscuits and potatoes).  Of course we shared our meals.  The "Biscuits French Toast" were delicious.  Their house made syrup wasn\'t too sweet.  This dish was subtle and fulfilling.  The "Coop Platter" is your typical hungry man platter.  They use Niman ranch bacon. Their sausage is made in house and so is their ranch sauce.  Now you\'re probably wondering "What the heck is she eating with ranch?"  Yes I eat my sausage and potatoes with ranch.  In fact I\'ll eat anything with ranch.  Their ranch really sticks out to me because they use dill and some other wicked secret ingredients I don\'t know about.  I liked it and wished I could\'ve took some back home with me to Cali.  The one thing I didn\'t care for from the "Coop Platter" was the grits.  Not a fan.  Overall great atmosphere and food was good for the most part.' u"To be truthful Southern food intimidates me. It can be overwhelmingly heavy and overly sweet making me feel even more calorie-conscious. But Jacob's Pickle does is well actually they kill it. Portions will not disappoint. Whether you'll finish the dish may depend on how much you've eaten earlier in the day the perfect balance of sweet and salty will tempt you to scraped the plate clean. \n\nI went on a weekday afternoon with five friends. There wasn't a wait but I'm told there would be one during peak hours. Service is incredibly friendly. I loved the modern/rustic interior. As for the food we ordered: buffalo mac&cheese fried pickles  the classic honey butter chicken bacon cheese egg chicken with biscuit and one of the spicy chicken dishes (the name slips my mind; my friend rates it 5/10 spicy but the waiter rated it 7/10 so I think it depends on your tolerance). All dishes were to die for. Mac & cheese is definitely a sharing portion if you're someone who likes to try various dishes and want it as a side. I don't normally like grits but the ones that came with each of the chicken dishes were amazing. \n\nExperienced wonderful service. It's got a cute vibe. Definitely one of my and my friends' go-to brunch spots in the Upper West Side." u"We came for brunch on a Saturday and waited almost two hours. The food coming out from the kitchen looked amazing. We basically knew everything we wanted before we sat down so we ordered right away.\n\nI got an order of the biscuits and gravy. We also got fried pickles and biscuits and jam as appetizers. The fried pickles were good! But for a place that does a lot of biscuit based dishes I found the biscuits to be underwhelming. The minute I cut into the biscuits they basically fell apart. The taste was buttery and flakey but they really lacked structure. The gravy was pretty good though I just wish there was more of it.\n\nI suppose brunch options are really slim in this area if this place is rated so highly. I found it to be pretty average but not somewhere that I'm going to be rushing back to any time soon." u"Def some good comfort food. I'm not a huge comfort food type of person especially during dinner but I was quite surprised as how much I enjoyed eating here. I don't like pickles but my fianc\xe9 and our friends we were with love pickles so it was great for them. They have tons of variety when it comes to pickles (it's called jacob's pickles they'd better be all on that pickle game). \n\nThey also have a pretty extensive beer list which definitely caught my attention. Wasn't expecting that. \n\nSo 3 of us ordered the sausage gravy smothered chicken with fries while my fiance got the salmon salad. We all enjoyed the food very much and all had trouble finishing our meals as the portions are quite large. The biscuits they come with are true southern type biscuits and tasted great." u'Best matzo ball soup! Ate inside first time and enjoyed the bar view. Came back to eat again  \nal fresco. Amazing inspiring soup. These folks make soup! Dining partner had fried chicken biscuit honey pickle sandwich. Disappeared left satisfaction. Decent beer list. I plan to return again snd again...' u"Went to Brunch yesterday - waited a good hour to be seated fortunately it was a beautiful day! \nWe were seated at a rather cramped table( five of us at a four top with a bench).\nNot dare complain-it would've been another 30 minutes. \nAnyway the service and the food were amazing.\nOur waiter was perfect and our brunch including chicken and pancakes Mac and cheese sausage gravy grits deviled eggs- all just delicious. \nPrices are good too.\nOnly thing maybe I'm old but it was so loud in there!\nAll in all it was a fabulous time and I will\ncertainly be back. Highly recommend."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
104.Mom’s Kitchen & Bar,[u"When I stay in the area I typically head to The Tick Tock diner for breakfast. This time decided to try something new and glad I did! This is a really fun cute spot with a menu of standard classics and some interesting new items. \n\nI arrived around 11 o'clock on a Sunday typically a pretty busy time for breakfast/brunch places. My party of two was seated about 20 minutes later so not an awful wait. They were offering to call people when their tables were ready. I enjoyed the kitschy decorations. It wasn't too overwhelming and featured a ton of my childhood favorites from the 80s - Strawberry Shortcake ALF Garbage Pail Kids... I also enjoyed the Cartoon Network playing on all of their big screen TVs.  \n\nI got a MOM-osa served in giant square goblet with bendy straw and Mac & cheese pancakes. They were massive! And very delicious. Service was friendly and attentive.\n\nI look forward to returning!" u"Stopped by in a group of 5 for an early Sunday brunch around 10:30/11 no issues with seating and it was surprisingly open for another hour or so.  Super sweet waiter excellent service great (and inexpensive) food.  We ended up sharing everything family style which is the way to go. \n\nChicken & Bacon Waffle: Really tasty the bacon is cooked into the waffles and the chicken has a great texture. Served more on the savory side with a cheese sauce. And Cholula honey - you need it in your life. \n\nShrimp & Cheesy Grits: I was more a fan of the grits than the shrimp because they were so well balanced with the peppercorn gravy & texturally sound. \n\nMac & Cheese Pancakes: I was not big on the idea of these (I imagined a stack of pancakes with mac & cheese and syrup thrown on top) but it was well-executed and I'm glad I gave it a try. The noodles are cooked into the pancakes and they're coated with a creamy cheese sauce. Completely savory. Again with the Cholula honey delicious.  \n\nDropkick Mushrooms: I'm super into mushroom dishes right now and enjoyed this though it wasn't a table favorite.  Creamy and served with toast. \n\nRainbow Bright Shake: It sounds completely over the top and it absolutely is.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't get one (to share). Topped with fruity pebbles frosting a ton of whipped cream and an entire cupcake. \n\nWatermelon Salad: Not actually a salad at all just a bowl of watermelon. Still good and I recommend some form of produce to counteract the greasy delights aforementioned above. Maybe greens or an actual salad. \n\nIced coffee was a table favorite.  They also serve Sunny D and Capri Sun for all of us nostalgic '90s kids. There's a Sunny D cocktail that looked great but we were all a bit too hungover to try that - next time!" u"Arrived Sunday morning around 10:30 and had a little bit of a wait expectedly. Got seated very quickly though. \nOur waitress was very nice but seemed rushed.\nCoffee was average.\nCheapest place I've found around nyc for chicken and waffles so I wanted to go here (most places I saw were over $20 but here is $15 I think).. DEFINITELY the best I've ever had.\nChicken and waffles could be served separately but they're amazing together. \nI got eggs as a side and they were a little cold which was upsetting but I got over it.\nId definitely return to this place if I visit nyc again.\nReally want to try one of their crazy milk shakes!!" u"Stopped by today for a quick breakfast. They were just opening. It's on a convenient corner of 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen and had a great low Key diner atmosphere. I got quick service and it was friendly.\n\nI ordered black coffee which was good and the shrimp and grits. The grits were amazingly good. Like among the best I've ever eaten with a delicious cheese sauce and smooth and creamy savory like I love. The shrimp and the gravy on the other hand were not good. I almost wanted to ask them to take that off and just give me the grits. The shrimp was too salty and the sauce not quit balanced. It was more like bbq sauce than gravy in flavor and really didn't complement the grits well. I'm still giving four stars because I have a feeling other things on the menu will be home runs. I want to come back and try some other things." u"I've been wanting the milkshakes here ever since I saw them on instagram and recently saw this new location in Manhattan. We came around noon on a weekday and the diner was about 1/3 full. \n\nMy sister and I shared the mac and cheese pancakes. They were amazingly delicious--I thought it would just be mac and cheese fried in a pancake shape but it was a fluffy pancake with mac and cheese mixed in. The sauce was creamy sweet and had a subtle kick to it. The different flavors went perfectly with the hot pancakes.\n\nWe also each got a milkshake--my sister got the mint chocolate one and I got the fruity pebbles. I liked how the fruity pebbles were still crunchy and the milkshake wasn't too sweet. My sister's milkshake had a nice minty chocolate taste but it was a little too sweet due to the fudge.  Definitely want to come back to try the other flavors though!" u"We had an excellent time here.  The food and drinks were great and the service was wonderful.  Special thanks to Joshua for making the night special. \nTry the friend chicken is nice and crispy not greasy.  The pitchers to share are not a bad deal either.  One thing to note it's a bit bright in there.  For a Friday night we felt like the lights were way too bright - they might consider dining them a bit." u"We went to Mom's this week for their opening day and it was quite good despite some opening-day snafus. But that of course was to be expected since we were hitting up this spot on their first day of business.\n\nSERVICE: The VERY best I've had in some time! The young man who handled our table was fun on the ball and very attentive! I forget his name now but when I return I'll be sure to ask and add it to my review.\n\nDRINKS: They have some big ass drinks and they are cheap! The margarita was a bit sweet to me but everything else was spot on... and did I say HUGE!!\n\nFOOD: Mom's features southern cuisine and everything we tried was great. We had a table of 6 and were able to try quite a bit of the menu. We had the wings cheese curds mushrooms fried chicken sandwich shrimp and grits pork benedict chicken and waffles and mac & cheese pancakes. All were super tasty! Some of the food came out lukewarm but we understood that the chefs were still working out the kinks so we were forgiving (and everything was tasty which made up for it)." u"A Southern/American diner-ish place (one in Astoria) now opened in Hell's Kitchen. I came by this place during their soft opening this and next week. They offer all-day brunch menus as well as other classic American options like burgers and of course diner-favorite: shakes. The decor is a bit like polished diner as well with cute detailed touches like old metal lunch boxes on the counter and bar taps that look like an old fridge (the one that you see in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull in which Indy gets into to survive the nuclear blast--don't ask me why I remember this detail).\n\nThe service is pretty great. All the staff members help each other to make sure the customers are taken care of. They asked me how the food was so that they can improve.\n\nThat said I think there some kinks that they'll have to figure out for food. I ordered chicken & gravy. For me the chicken was a bit rubbery. Not sure if it's the seasoning on the chicken or the batter but the chicken was too salty. For my sides I had the roasted zucchini and watermelon salad. The zucchini was not all that warm so it felt like they had been sitting there for a while. The watermelon salad though it looked cool the execution could be better--perhaps fresher watermelon slices and sweeter. It was not a refreshing as I hoped.\n\nAll in all I think I'll come back in a few weeks to see how they've changed. Welcome to the neighborhood." u'Amazing breakfast!!! The Ellsworth cheese curds were delightful. I ordered the Tex Benedict and would definitely recommend. Family friendly plus adults can enjoy a libation or two. Great place to cap off a great long weekend in NYC.' u"Okay now this place used to be Jolly Monk which was a pretty cool bar with good food. Now it's done a total 180 degrees and I love it! I went on Columbus Day with a few friends around 8pm. It was pretty slow. \n\nThe interior is full of black and white and the wallpaper has jukeboxes on it. The bar has a fake 1950s looking fridge that's actually for beer on tap. Really cool interior. Lots of hightop seating. They also play Cartoon Network on their televisions and their music selection is full of 90s and early 00s music which I was really digging. \n\nService was super friendly.\n\nThe food was pretty good. For a drink I got the Sunny D lite which is essentially a sunny D with i believe vodka. Really really good. Also the cheapest alcoholic beverage besides beers. \n\nFor my entree I got the fish sandwich with curly fries. The fish they use is catfish which I will say I don't normally love but they seasoned it pretty well. There is supposed to be a Cajun tartar sauce on it but it didn't taste like Cajun. There was also a cole slaw on it which was very fresh. \n\nFor dessert I got the rainbow bright which took a while for them to send out so that was a little annoying but didn't bother me too much. The milkshake was tasty with nice bites of fruity pebbles in easy sip which I loved. There was also lots of whip cream a vanilla cupcake two lollipops strawberry sauce and the glass was rimmed with icing and fruity pebbles. Really great shake. Definitely would recommend.\n\nThis place is great for either families or couples or even for a cool bar experience. Really had a good time. Definitely recommend this place for an array of people. Check it out!" u"Was curious about trying this place out and I'm very glad that I did! I had the Bayou Shrimp and my friend and I split the Dirty Shirley 32oz drink. The shrimp was delicious! It came with two sides of your choice; I picked the green beans and mac & cheese. The drink was good although it was described as enough for 2.5 drinks I felt the 32oz deal was just enough for 2 drinks as we had powered it into separate glasses. \n\nOverall I will definitely return! Really want to try the milkshakes and other drinks. Happy that this opened in my neighborhood." u"mac & cheese pancakes with cholula honey drizzled on top. not only was this place the cutest lil lunchbox diner but the food was SO GOOD and my server (Dylan?) was probably the kindest person that lives in NYC. Y'all I loved it here. Honestly when I walked by I knew I wanted to give it a try and then when I saw MAC & CHEESE PANCAKES on the menu out front I practically ran in to claim my table. This combination sounds insane but I tell ya it was good af. praise be to the brunch gods for this magical meal @momsmidtown" u"What an awesome new place !!! You can have breakfast all day long. The chicken & waffles was excellent. The staff is very friendly and know the menu  if they didn't know something they asked someone else" u'Came here based on Yelp reviews...super happy we did. Daniel our server went above and beyond to make our dining experience a good one! The skirt steak and Mac n cheese were highlights and the location and menu choices were fab! If we lived here we would be regulars...' u"I went during the soft opening and the restaurant has lots of potential.  There is room for improvement on the level of service (water timing of food condiments straws...small things customers shouldn't have to worry about).  The decor of the main room is cool and has a retro feel.  The second room however seems unfinished and needs a little more personality (color accessories). The menu is well designed and easy to read.  The food presentation needs some work to match the menu descriptions.  The wings were great but half the batch was slightly burnt. The salad had great ingredients but the crispy chicken wasn't crispy by the time the food came out (we waited 30 minutes).   The tomatoes soups and the curly fries were delicious !!  I will definitely come back after the full opening and will update my review." u'Wish we had found this sooner so we could have eaten here more than once! Everything about this place is awesome! I ordered the appetizer mac & cheese as my meal with one of the shakes for dessert...it was everything that I could have hoped for and more. It tasted delicious and the presentation was very cool! My husband had a burger and fries (started eating it before I could snap a pic) and some green beans that were well seasoned and well cooked. Atmosphere was the right mix of retro and modern and the music was fun and nostalgic. Service was awesome too. Honestly not a single bad thing to say about this place!' u"I Have been to Mom's Kitchen & Bar at least three times. The last time was to have the Fruity Pebbles Pancakes and the Cracker Jack Bacon.  I will always return for the Watermelon Rita!!  Ask for a few limes!  Sooo goood!  #HKRoulette" u"I wasn't overly impressed. Went in for breakfast. Eggs were good. Bacon was fine but skimpy for a $3 add on.  Waffle was very small for the price. So not a great deal.  Quality was middling good. Service was good but I was literally the only customer in there lol." u"Had the mac and cheese for a starter. It wasn't gooey as I had expected. Instead it was more like cheese curds and bacon with not enough macaroni. Next the chicken and did not come out hot. Waffle was a bit soggy even though I got the cheese sauce on the side. The chocolate milkshake was the best part of my meal. Service was friendly but food was mediocre." u"Second time here.  We were heartbroken a while back when we found our beloved Jolly Monk had closed since we moved from the neighborhood but we've been pleased with our meals both times.  The staff is friwndly & attentive the decor is nice food is really good & my daughter loves that they play Cartoon Network on the tv's rather than sports."],0.902,0.345,0.655,0.0
15.Margon,[u"yooo this place is OFFICIAL. If you don't speak up the Spanish-speaking people behind the counter will straight up ignore you forever...haha...it's great. Gotta have the Cubano...the bread is out of this world soft and good. It is huge very filling. The little chicken lollipop thing they give you with your rice and beans is also incredible...I might have even liked the chicken more than the Cuban sandwich. \n\nAlso highly highly highly recommended is the mango batido. OMG this was to die for. \n\nGotta hit this place up if you're in NYC and you want Cuban or you're in midtown." u"I work in Westchester County NY. I have a staff of employees that work on 42nd St. I can't always make it down there to visit them. On Halloween we were having a luncheon in our Westchester office and my staff in NYC is unable to come. I researched found Margon via Yelp. They opened up early which was a huge plus. The man that answered was very pleasant and patient; I explained I wanted to have 2 deliveries (for the morning crew and then the evening crew). He confirmed the food order the delivery time and location both my contact phone numbers and took my payment information. The first order was delivered successfully and the staff loved the food. Since placing the order I had an employee call out sick. I called the restaurant back to change the order and it was done with no hesitation. They processed each delivery separately at the time they were scheduled for. Second order went as great as the first.\n\nI look forward utilizing them again in the future. I am huge on customer service and professionalism. They exceeded my expectations and I am thankful!!" u"This is the best Cuban diner around. No frills cheap hearty and delicious. The portions are impossible to finish but just be careful because you'll want to save room for a mamey milkshake. Sweet and generous staff. You can't go wrong with the roast chicken oxtail octopus or ceviche. \n\nHide from the midtown crowds and tuck in." u"I only come here for a lunch to go but I have to say I'm so impressed! \n\nThe Cuban sandwich was just as delicious as everyone said it would be. There's all the right components and I really liked the condiments they put in it. It's also pretty big so I had half for lunch and half for dinner! \n\nI've also tried their entrees which rotate depending on the day of week but they're all delicious. I got the Oxtail Stew which had amazing flavor. It was so tender and comes with rice beans and the best fried plantains I've ever had! Again great portion sizes. Definitely going to be back to try some more." u'Amazing authentic Cubanos with lovely family-run vibe. Food was incredible and very generous. Tucked away in an unassuming little shop front no frills but the food is amazing! A must try!' u"Pepper steak was tasty. Yellow rice and black beans were great. Sweet plantains we're okay. Guy at the cash register was helpful and thanked me for my business. Once you walk in go to the back and get in line. Let them know what you're eating and proceed toward the cash register to pay." u'This hole-in-the-wall offers different specials each day of the week. I have been told to make sure to get there after the rush hour lunch period because it can get extremely packed. The place is extremely narrow and can barely fit tables in there so I would advise to bring the food to go. \n\nThe employee who was helping me at the counter was extremely helpful. I asked him for recommendations and he let me sample different types of meats and salads.\n\nI ended up ordering:\n\n-Oxtail Monday specials $12\nIt came with beans and rice. However there was only 4 pieces of oxtail in it and it was mostly bones. Its a problem with the rice and beans were hotter than the oxtail. \n\n-Octopus Salad\nThe flavors were enriched with all types of peppers. However for a tiny container of the salad it was $8??\n\n-Cuban Sandwich\nPrice to portion the cuban sandwich is your best bet! The flavors come together really well especially with all the different sauces on top of the meats.' u"This place is a gem ! When a restaurant is the size of a storage closet but the line goes out the door you know this food is gonna be good.\nI ordered the chicken and pernil both orders came with a huge portion of rice and beans with a side of sweet platains. \nThe chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside what else could you want from it ? It goes great with the side of garlic sauce that comes with it.\nThe same goes for the pernil that I got as well only available on Wednesday so be aware. The pernil was perfect because it was shredded and easy to pull apart. It's common where some places over cook the pernil and its dry and bland but this place does it right. \nOnly problem is I don't live closer to this place otherwise I'd be here everyday" u"What an awesome place in the heart of the theater district. The Cuban cuisine is incredible and the people are better. I love that as soon as you walk through the door you see the sandwiches presses working overtime.\n\nThe Cubano sandwich is a must. It has to be one of the best ones I've had north of Miami. The pernil was juicy and the saltiness of the ham were a perfect balance.\n\nThe chicharron con pollo were amazing and their mojito dipping sauce is killer.\n\nI haven't met a plate of maduras I didn't like but these were so good  I was definitely keeping my sharing at a minimum!\n\nThe beef empanadas were almost as good as my wife's ( had to say that or she might never make them again!). There were some garlicky undertones that we're really nice.\n\nSo if you are in midtown and are looking for something other than a TGI Friday's with a giant neon sign do yourself a favor and stop here for lunch." u"Had this place for the first time after co-workers were raving about it. I had the cubano sandwich. It was authentic and really good(very oily). The place however was very tiny and crowded. I would like to try more than and see if I can give this place 5 stars. \n\nI would recommend this place for lunch since it's only open till 5 however; be ready to wait online for at least 15 minutes." u"Super cute and cultured little restaurant! You can see that everyone there was really passionate about the Cuban culture because they had music on the entire time and the workers and some customers were dancing to it as they work / order food. They were closing at 5PM But we decided to take a chance and dropped by since we were starving and had no food since the AM. \n\nBy the time we arrived it was around 4:50PM and they didn't have a lot of food left (meaning that it must have been awesome since they sold out). I ordered a roast pork which came with a very large rice and beans side. Oh my it was delicious!! The pork was super flavorful. One thing I would like tho is the food to be hot. It was cold when they plated it. My boyfriend ordered a Cuban sandwich and I had a try. It was really good - tasted like a panini to me. There were people coming in still after 5 PM and they were still serving them. Super nice workers! They also gave us each a drumstick to sample since they were closing anyways and it was delicious! Definitely will order that again!" u"Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Had the Kingfish with rice and gravy.  AMAZING!  I'd be back there again today and just found out it's CLOSED!!!  I'm going back ASAP.  That food is so scrumptious!  The staff are friendly and accommodating.  It's the BEST!!!" u'Horrible service. This place used to be a bit better way back in the day but lately they\'ve gotten really bad.\n\nI was standing in line waiting to make an order - person taking orders walks by is busy walks away. Another person comes in gets in line behind me person taking orders comes back takes that person\'s order. I said "um excuse me" to try to get the order taker\'s attention but was completely ignored for some reason. Never going back.' u"Everyone here is so friendly and welcoming! I came here early morning on a weekday as they were still preparing the sandwiches for the day and you can tell that they have many regulars. The customers could see that it was my first time here so I didn't really know how this place worked and they immediately recommended me to try the Cuban sandwich which was what I had come for anyway. Since the sandwiches were not ready yet the workers told us we could sit down and they'd let us know when our order was ready. They had a decent amount of seating which was great. The Cuban sandwich was amazing and really hit the spot. I was able to split a sandwich with a friend since it's quite heavy for an early morning meal. Though I'm sure there's much more to this place than the Cuban sandwich but you should definitely try it." u"Only reason I couldn't give that 5 star was because of the condition of the restaurant on the inside. Staff were polite ( surprising since it's NY) and professional. Got my good promptly and the foot traffic was high and fast. \n\nFood:\nCubano sand which (5/5): first time having one and I loved it. Crispy heavy mayo and juicy meat. \nYellow rice and red beans (5:5) I know it's just rice and beans but the simplicity of it made me love it. A few Fried banana pieces included was ok but the star was the rice and beans and I usually don't eat beans.\n\nLove finding hidden jems like this. No reason to go to an expensive spot to have quality food. Much respect guys keep up the good work." u"This is a small Cuban restaurant hidden amongst the crazy of Times Square nearby. I wanted to come here because I heard it was easier on the wallet and plus I don't think I have ever eaten Cuban food before. I got a breakfast plate and took a snapchat and my old roomie from Peru commented on my picture and said that was what he ate when he was a kid living in Peru!! Definitely very authentic Latin American food. It filled me up pretty quick. However the place is small and so the kitchen smoke and grease seeped through our clothes. And it was a hot humid NYC morning so our experience was a bit uncomfortable despite the few fans/AC units they had installed at the top. The workers were so busy so it was a bit troublesome to get their attention. And over all the noise of the kitchen it was hard to hear and understand them. But they were nice anyways. Will I come back? Definitely for the price and the authenticity of the food." u"1000 stars for the f$%#ing Cuban sandwich.\n\nI swear to god this was the best Cuban I've eaten in my ENTIRE LIFE. As I was eating it like a piggy my tongue responded with all of the nuanced flavorings by running away from me. I don't normally converse with strangers at a restaurant but I was gushing to the person sitting next to me how amazing the sandwich was. He kept laughing because I couldn't go through more than one bite without a string of expletives and crooning the sandwich's praise between mouthfuls of meat and bread. Granted it may be on the small side for voracious eaters but for someone like me it hit the spot just fine.\n\nThe Cubano runs about $10 and it's cooked on lightly toasted bread with mustard pickles and ham. It's completely constructed and cooked right in front of you. Well... sort of. I was sitting at the bar and they had one cook making the Cubanos in the corner so not everyone could see him doing his majestic work. But trust me this sandwich is made-to-order every time. It's gloriously messy (I used over half a dozen napkins) but packs so much flavor that it's kind of a revelation. As for the establishment itself everyone is right about it being a smallish hole in the wall. But the service is quick and you can get free water (but do note that it extremely busy).\n\nGet the Cubano get the Cubano get the Cubano. It is simply fantastic." u"Margon is right in the heart of the Time Square tourist area but you won't find many tourists eating there. When we lunched at Margon the customers were mostly people working nearby and Latinos. Margon is on 46th between 6th and 7th Avenues. \n\nThis place is simple and inexpensive with great tasting food. It is basically cafeteria style and one chooses their dishes with a tray and then pays the cashier at the end of the line. My daughter had the Pollo Asada and I ordered the Cuban sandwich. We also shared a beef empanada. The chicken was really flavorful and was served with rice and beans and plantains. The empanada was delicious also. My Cuban sandwich was a little messy but fantastic. This was the best Cuban sandwich I think I have ever consumed and I have consumed quite a few. This was also a prefect size sandwich.\n\nAll this food and two drinks set us back $25.00. That is darn good for NYC! Margon is not pretty inside but comfortable enough. Highly recommended if looking for simple great tasting Latin food. Margon is also a great choice if time is of an issue also. We were in and out quickly.\n\n4 Yelp stars." u"First day in NY my friend and I were jet lagged and wanted a quick bite. She wanted to take me to a place remembered that had a really good Cuban sandwich. She looked it up on Yelp and we headed over.\n\nIt's a deep hole in the wall. A take out counter with prepared food and also a menu to order from. It looked like it was close to closing it was partially empty when we got there.\n\nMy friend was recovering from food poisoning or some stomach virus so she didn't really want to eat much so we split a Cuban sandwich ordered some waters an espresso drink and a vanilla soda for me. The sandwich was as good as she described! A little bit messy with the sauces oozing out the other end!\n\nThe guy that worked there took notice that she wasn't feeling well and made her his special concoction. It was sweet of him to do so! It didn't really help but it was very nice of him.\n\nIt's not a fancy place. Very casual and convenient. It passed the NY food safety according to the sign posted at the door. So that's good enough for me. I would definitely recommend this place!" u'Cubano in New York City! I ordered it to go; food was hot fresh and delicious. \n\nThe pickles are fresh the meat is tender and not too salty and the bread was nice hot and toasty. \n\nI will definitely come back. \n\n-- The coffee was really good too. Perfect for the 20 degree weather this morning.\n\nThanks Margon.'],0.5719,0.316,0.684,0.0
115.360 Bar & Grill,[u"Talented friendly professional staff. Cook a perfect medium rare burger (I'd recommend the blue cheese it's perfect). \n\nThey're new at this location so no crowds (for now). Lovely place stop in for wings a drink or a good chat!" u"This place just opened! I came here on a Friday night for happy hour although I think their drink specials last all day at the moment since it's still a soft opening. $4 beers and $5 wine - amazing prices for the area!! And good beer too not just the usual bud light. One thing to note is that their draft beers are 12oz not a full pint. Service was great - one of the most attentive waitresses I've ever had although possibly because there weren't many other patrons. I'm happy this place popped up near my office and look forward to returning!" u'This is my local while I am staying in NYC! The service is 10/10 and they will definitely treat you right. \nInexpensive drinks and good service what more can you ask for?' u'Very chill place. If you ever want to sit back relax and have a casual conversation then this is the spot!' u"This has got to be the gem of the theater district. I've lived here my whole life use to work at the Film Center building and had no idea this place even existed. The mood of the place is casual and easy going great staff amazing mixologist bartender who makes a drink that's well balanced. Me and friends ordered food after a few drinks and to our surprise the food was all well balanced too. The mussels coconut soup base wasn't over salted the oysters were fresh calamari was perfectly done on the crisp side and the texture on the inside. The best part is their special on the Mongolian beef skewers I've no idea they were serving that prefect shish-kebab where most restaurant just couldn't seem to get it right for the life of them. I nearly questioned myself if I was in Beijing or if I was in Manhattan." u'This place was fantastic! Came in because of the great deal they had ($10 for a burger and a beer) which I think was a deal that lasted all day. Super solid burger great beer and the owner and staff were ridiculously friendly and sweet. Totally intend to come here again. Beers were also $4 outside of the deal and it was a really solid selection.'],0.2247,0.127,0.873,0.0
106.Hunt & Fish Club,[u'Ambiance is perfect for a date. Dim lights good music and the food/ drinks are good as well. They offer many different dining and lounge areas for private events parties or just a night out. \n\nThe service was good as well. Our waiter was very attentive and informative. He suggested a Hennessy cocktail since I am fond of Cognac and ended with a suggestion of their Margarita sorbet which was amazing!' u'Went here for a work dinner. We had a set menu but the food was really good. Started off with the lobster bisque (frankly just ok) filet mignon (exceptional) and 3 layer choc cake(yeah!)\n\nDecent upscale restaurant.' u"I just went here this past Saturday and absolutely loved my experience. I went with a group of about 12 people for my friend's birthday dinner. I have to admit when I found out my friend picked a steakhouse located in Time's Square for his birthday dinner I was disappointed. Right in Times Square seriously? I felt like a complete tourist on the ride up but this place is worth the crowded traffic buzzing outside. \n\nBread: \nThe bread they dropped off at our table was some of the best bread I have eaten in a really long time. The bread is large doughy circles hollow on the insides. I could have continue eating that bread and forgot everything else on the menu. \n\nTruffle tater tots:\nJUMBO! Served to us piping hot with a large enough quantity to share with a friend. Delicious.\n\nMain course: King Crab Spaghetti: \nThe pasta was cooked to perfection. The ratio to crab meat and pasta was just right. I was beyond happy with my main course selection. \n\nI tried both the 100 year old cognac ice cream and cheesecake selections. Both delicious. \n\nService: \nEveryone was so kind. Our entire group felt very well treated all night long. The waiters were there exactly when we needed them and gone when we were in the midst of enjoying each other's company. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try one of their seafood towers. \n\nThanks Hunt and Fish for a lovely time." u'It\'s pricey popular gets crowded even on weeknights so you best have reservations. If you don\'t they don\'t mind telling you as they told me "there will be about a 2 hour wait." But lucky for me I found a seat at the bar. \n\nThe d\xe9cor of the area near the bar is near men\'s club like warm and charming. The rear dining area boarders on being somewhat gaudy but not tastelessly so. You just have to keep in mind that you are in New York.  \n\nThe food at Hunt & Fish Club however is top notch very good with their HFC Three Course lunch for $38 being of particularly good value. For my dinner meal I went for their 8 ounce filet mignon with additional sauce ($48) along with a side of Parmesan fries ($14) and a Maker\'s Mark Manhattan ($16). \n\nWhen served my steak was not only eye appealing but prepared exactly as order. My Parmesan fries were likewise good as was my cocktail which contained real extra sweet maraschino wine soaked as opposed to red brined cherries. The only thing preventing me from going Five Stars on Hunt & Fish Club is that the menu isn\'t all that innovative or creative that would mark it as being superlative or exception as compared to other restaurants in its same class.' u"Let's get some good food in Times Square (said no one ever....successfully) - until!!! Hunt & Fish club is that place. I mean legit food. Bring an important client legit. \n\nThe bar out front is an acceptable please to start but I've had better service. They also didn't want to transfer the bar tab to the table check - not as expense account friendly as I'd have hoped.\n\nNo worries as the food is the main event. For starters If you're into seafood towers they will not disappoint. However the secret side order item is definitely the truffle tater tots. They are jumbo marshmallow sized and insanely delicious. Don't eat more than one or they'll roll you out. In the main department you'll enjoy their fish of the day (especially if it's the halibut) or the on-menu branzino (ask for it to be deboned). Where you might want to keep the bone in is the rib eye - steakhouse grade! Save room though for the dessert. Go straight for the 24 layer cake (confirmed - 24 layers- see my picture) and share (it's pretty big)." u"A traditional New York steakhouse located right by times square. The menu is filled with traditional steakhouse entrees with a few surprises that will entice the pallet.\n\nThat being said we wished the menu lived up to expectations.\n\nThe steaks did not come out ideal the flavor was lacking and the service was less the ideal.\n\nA few words of advice if you're thinking about making a reservation.\n\nMake sure you love the menu we asked if there were any specials (Friday night) and surprised to hear there weren't any that evening.\n\nThe bar staff was extremely friendly had a great attitude and if I were to return again it would be to grab a quick cocktail from them." u"After an internal company Friday happy hour we needed to get our grub on and this was in the vicinity and to our pretentious liking...we were in that kind of mood what can I tell ya.  Haters gonna hate!\n\nUpon entering past the red velvet curtains we found ourselves sitting at the cozy bar/lounge area while dinner service seemed to be in full swing in the expansive main dining area situated behind the bar.  There were two bartenders behind the bar being that it was a Friday night.  We had the bar to ourselves for the better part of the evening and they regaled us with their humorous stories.  We forged ahead with our evening and ordered a couple of old fashioneds along with the magnificent seafood tower!  I was rejoicing being in shellfish nirvana!\n\nEverything tasted fresh and magnifique and their ginormous rolls were simply blissful.  So airy and light to the touch warm and buttery once devoured!  From king crab legs jumbo prawns to lobster tails oh my!  I needed to be revived from my shellfish stupor!\n\nOn my way to the restroom located in the back of the restaurant I got the chance to check out the dining area.  While more formal and staff being on their p's and q's it seemed tastefully charming with a minimal air of pretension going on.  It is the city after all!" u'Oh wow! This midtown restaurant was amazing! From the seafood tower to the apps and followed by the steak. The decor is grand and the service was elegant. \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner!' u'This is probably my favorite steakhouse in town! The food was simply amazing ! We ordered the stuffed lobster and tomahawk steak. The server could of been better but the busboy and hostess made up for it. The ambiance is romantic and excellent for anniversaries. I will definitely be back !' u"Beautiful setting well-lit with hospitable staff making you feel welcome even if you've been walking around all day in casual attire. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The meal was nothing spectacular in terms of creativity or flavor but safe can also be satisfying and enjoyable. Good for entertaining groups with multiple dietary preferences in a pretty and moderately priced venue." u"The food was out of this world. My best friend and her husband loved the Brussel sprouts and I had the salmon which was divine. To top it off they ordered the chocolate cake which was large enough for 4! Decor was trendy and on point. I'll definitely be back." u"Tried this place out for restaurant week early Thursday evening so it wasn't crowded. Service was fine and the decor made it memorable. Of note the temperature needs to be better controlled. The majority of my party was freezing the entire time and even the drinks (great wine selection) couldn't warm us up- helpful tip bring a cardigan!\n\nFor the food we tried all four appetizers from the RW menu: poached egg & mushrooms burrata fried polenta and oysters- listed in order from best to worst IMO. If I was rating solely based on that poached egg & mushrooms dish this place would be a 5 star. Perfect egg with amazingly seasoned mushrooms over a spinach sauce that was heavenly- really good! It's hard to go wrong with burrata over prosciutto but nothing special; the fried polenta was decent but the glops of honey everywhere made it cloyingly sweet; and the oysters were a bit too salty (FYI don't eat the foundation the 3 oysters came out on because its inedible salt...)\n\nWe also tried all four main entrees: Arctic char hangar steak chicken and bolognese. The fish was by far the best with a great crispy seared skin and juicy filet. The steak was fine but a dish of very small portion- the many burnt potatoes around the few pieces tricked us into thinking there was more meat! The chicken also had amazingly crispy skin but the meat was extremely dry and tough... and the bolognese pasta was fine but pretty doughy and heavy on the butter. Overall the dishes were decent but nothing remarkable. \n\nThe desserts were probably the most disappointing as the cake gelato and sorbet were all very sour and heavy on the acids which definitely did not satisfy the sweet tooth craving to end the meal..." u"My sister and I came here for my birthday lunch since she couldn't venture too far away from work and we wanted something a little more luxurious. It happened to be restaurant week so we went with that menu. \n\nAs soon as we entered we were greeted by a friendly hostess who offered to check our coats. We were then immediately seated. Unfortunately it was the first seat upon entering so every time someone opened the door we felt the harsh chill of the winter weather.\n\nService was attentive and not overbearing. The popovers impressed both of us and we could not stop raving about them. Our appetizers came out and were also delicious. I got the burrata and my sister got the baked clams. It was my sister's first time trying a burrata and I think I've introduced a new cheese in her life. The baked clams were so flavorful and borderline heavy. For the main we both got the hanger steak medium rare. It had an assortment of mushrooms and this wine sauce? Dessert here wasn't as amazing as some of the other restaurants we've been too but by the end we were really stuffed. I got the pear tart and my sister got the gelato. It was pretty normal.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty large and gorgeous inside. There are large chandelier-like lights in the center and booth like seating. While dining we noticed mostly business people enjoying their lunch here or groups of friends. There is also a bar right as you enter next to the hostess' stand." u'Came to the hunt and fish club on a Tuesday night and I was not disappointed!\n\nFirst of all you walk into a curtained room that opens into the bar area & the hostess stand which is very dark. The hostess then walks you into a chic low light room with the most fabulous chandelier/lighting fixture. \n\nI wish I had gotten our waiters name because he was amazing helpful & very attentive. I was there earlier in the night around 6 PM so that could account for it - as the place was not exactly packed. \n\nI had a delicious cocktail called the Sound Machine. It had pineapple juice so it was the perfect amount of sweet. I am not 100% sure what kind of liquor was in it. But the drink was great. \n\nWe started off with oysters and the crab cake. The oysters according to my mother were the best she\'s had. Although I cannot attest I did not have any but I do trust her on this. The crab cake was perfect - it came with a dipping sauce and an apple cole slaw. \n\nAlso we were given a tasting of a salmon crostini that was DIVINE ! The bread for the table are rosemary popovers that can only be described with the word WOW. \n\nFrom just the first half of the meal I was blown away. \n\nFor my entree I ordered "Max\'s Lobster Lasagna" which is not like a normal lasagna at all. It was layers of Long thick pasta and lobster with the greatest San marzano fresh tomato sauce. The lasagna I would compare to a savory cinnamon bun. It was so innovative I love it !\n\nMy mother had the swordfish which she also was over the moon about. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the carrot cake with the bourbon ice cream. The carrot cake was my least favorite part of the meal but the bourbon ice cream was fantastic ! I had never had a liquor infused ice cream and I am upset I hadn\'t tried one sooner. \n\nAlthough it is pricey I highly recommend the Hunt & Fish Club for a great night out with either a group of friends a parent or a date.' u"If you are looking for the best place to go relax and feel like you're in your own home relaxing and eating great food with amazing service this is it. \n\nSo conveniently located but more than that amazing food and drink. \n\nYou must meet Nelson he will stop by your table.  \n\nTheir wines are perfect and their bar drinks are made perfectly. \n\nThe octopus is the most try. It's grilled and somehow tastes creamy and dreamy!  I have no idea how they do that but it's the best I've ever had. \n\nTheir rolls... I don't even know what they are but they serve them with the most amazing herb butter... again impressed even this cynical foodie. \n\n\nWe also had the meatball. I don't like meatballs. I loved this meatball. Their red sauce was divine! \n\nI don't know what they do to their food but I know I can't wait to go back. \n\nThey really get it right here.  Very impressed." u'Past by Saturday night for dinner just the two of us. We sat at the bar tables by the window and we were greeted by a very lovely young lady from behind the bar I think her name was Charlie. Anyway the food was very good though the menu is a bit small and cocktails were delicious !! Service was great thanks Charlie. Will be back.' u"I have traveled the world and have been eating in the theatre district of New York for years. \n\nA friend recommended this place prior to seeing The Jersey Boys show. I was blown away. \n\nWe walked in a little later than I'd hoped because of needing to see the show. The multiple people to greet is were all very friendly and accommodating. We even met one of the owners Nelson who bought us our first cocktail. Within 3 minutes we were seated in this spectacular dining room. (We wanted to sit at the bar but it was packed). \n\nThe server came over. Asked if we were going to a show asked what time we needed to be there and assured us he would make sure we would be taken care of in time. \n\nWe ordered multiple things all at once not caring how they came out. This is where it blew me away. The food was spectacular. Burrata chilled shellfish cocktails baked shrimp and believe it or not the highlight were the tater tots with a truffle dipping sauce. These are NOT your frozen tater tots. \n\nWe left in time and were at the show just as the show was starting. \n\nWas my first time there. Will not be my last." u"The food was fine but this is a pricey place and for the money i have had much better food elsewhere.\n\ni started with a iceberg salad.  they served it chopped and it was really good.  Had the french onion soup and it was just ok.  i would get something else next time.\n\nthe staff was less than expected.  we were on our way to the theatre and not in suits and ties and they didn't treat us so well.  We had to keep waving the waiter over to help us.  They brought the wrong thing once.  And we told them we had a deadline for the theatre he acknowledged it then pretty much ignored it.  We had to pay as we were running out.\n\nI see a lot of other nice reviews so maybe we just hit a bad night.  but we sat down early at 5pm and were the first people in." u'I was surprisingly impressed.  I knew the decor would be nice (having walked by before) but thought it would be overpriced and not of a quality to match. It is still overpriced (however a Gilt City coupon fixed that) but I really had a nice meal and lovely surroundings with attentive service.\n\nFirst came an amuse bouche.  I think it was a risotto ball which was very good with excellent flavor.\n\nInitially they forgot to bring their popovers but one of the waiters realized that and brought them over and glad he did.  One does not see popovers very often but these were perhaps the best I have ever had.  They were moist and had a consistency inside a bit like custard.  Fabulous.  They came with herb butter but I also used olive oil.  \n\nThe oyster presentation was very nice.\n\nThe strip steak was 16 oz bone-in at $62 which is way too much for a bone-in.  It would be high if it were without the bone but way too high for a bone-in.  Also it was a bit small for a steak lover.  It really should have been 18 oz. if not 20 oz. given the bone.\n\nThe mashed potatoes portion for $14 was very large. They were very good but too creamy for my taste. I really prefer a lumpier and less creamy mashed.\n\nFor dessert the Twenty-Four Layer Chocolate Pudding Cake at $18 is very good.  More than enough for two or even three.  I generally prefer a flourless cake but with so many layers and so much thick ganache between each layer it is definitely pleasing to a chocoholic. \n\nThe service was efficient and attentive.\n\nThere may be better steaks in New York at a slightly lower cost but you will probably not get the same atmosphere.' u'My friend and I made reservations for this place since it was featured during restaurant week. \n\nBad choice. \n\nGot the oyster appetizer to start with. It did not taste fresh and it also had a pile of what looked like the "polenta" as stated in the menu. Took a bite of it and realized it was a mixture of salt bread crumbs and some seasoning. \n\nWe were told after the fact it was not edible! \n\nA educated chef would know not to serve anything a customer cannot eat!!! \n\nTwo days later and I now have a uncontrollably cough! \n\nFor the main course we ordered the steak. The potatoes were spicy and well seasoned but the steak was very bland. \n\nFinally dessert was something you could have gotten at the local bakery. Nothing special.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
57.Best Bagel and Coffee,[u"All the other bagels I've tasted in my life now taste like dirt compared to these bagels.   Even the most delicious bagels of my past don't even compare.  \n\nMy sesame bagel was still warm.  Perfect combo of crispy and chewy on the outside but so soft in the middle.  \n\nYou could see the hand rolled layers of dough.  \n\nTruly delicious so glad I trusted all the other Yelp reviews." u'So my wife says "let\'s go here for coffee and bagels" and I say " you\'re nuts - it\'s at least a 10 min cab ride why not find something here". Well we went here and when she\'s right she\'s right!\n\nLong line but it moved quickly so didn\'t feel too bad. Ordering was accurate which is always nice. I got a poppy bagel with scallions cream cheese and she got a whole wheat everything with eggs. All were delicious.  We took a third bagel for later (lots of walking planned!) Sesame with jalape\xf1o cream cheese ... wasn\'t spicy at all which was disappointing. \n\nCoffee was okay - nothing special but not bad. \n\nOverall a great food!  Lost a star since it has very few seats!  Think there is a better layout to optimize seating.' u"For a place that called itself best bagels I've had better in nyc. I only stopped here because I was in a rush. It was busy but the service was quick. Which is the good news but 12$ for two everything bagels with tofu cream Cheese and a soda..... \n\nThe everything beagles are lightly covered and the tofu cream cheese was only half spread lightly on both bagels.\n\nIf you go to pick-a-bagel or Ess-a-Bagle are both far superior to this place simply for quality and amount of what you get for what you pay for. Won't be coming back to this place." u"I will forever dream about their bagels. Scallion cream cheese + lox on a whole wheat everything bagel = heaven. Seriously heaven. \n\nThe lox was great (no fishy smells here!) the helping of cream cheese was a plenty and it was toasted just enough to give the bagel some crunch and make the cream cheese extra gooey and perfect. \n\nI'm sure everyone on my train ride to Newark airport was super jealous of my awesome breakfast and throroughly hating my guts. \n\nI'd call that a win!" u"My husband doesn't eat bread or other carb-y stuff that much but we went here anyway.\nWe ordered:\nHam cheese and egg with garlic bagel chives cream cheese\nlox egg and cheese with garlic bagel and chives cream cheese\n\nThey were soooo good! Especially the ham bagel. He even asked to come back but sadly we had no time. We came at 7.55 AM on Saturday and there was a line already and it got longer and longer. Service was pretty quick though." u"Don't come here expecting a lot of place to sit down and eat. You should know what you want to order to avoid getting the busy New Yorkers in line behind you frustrated. I found this place on yelp and decided to eat here on my recent trip to New York where I left in a hurry without having my breakfast or coffee. Their menu and types of cream cheeses is perplexing. Their cream cheeses made me feel like I was at a gelato place only I did not ask for tasters. Ordered the onion bagel everything bagel bacon cream cheese and jalape\xf1o cream cheese to go. Yes you should never be very hungry when you come to such places because you end up over ordering. Everything was delicious. They have a good array of sandwiches too. I ordered cappuccino too which was honestly too sweet and disappointing. \n\nStick to the bagels and cream cheese and you won't be disappointed. There will be a line to order first then to pay. Don't stand in the wrong line or else you'll end up waiting for the food you never ordered." u'I am a firm believer that the best food in NYC is located on the streets and not the Avenues.  To stay alive in NYC restaurants need frequent patrons.  That either comes from natural foot traffic (avenues) or because you have a real damn good reason to go there (streets).  Best Bagel and Coffee is proof of that. There are so many dumpy options around Penn/MSG that do well because of foot traffic.  BBC is actually good though.  Although their name is kind of reminiscent of that scene in Elf ... "Worlds Best Coffee" they truly do have incredible bagels.  I cannot really speak to the quality of their coffee though. \n\nBagels have the perfect level of density softness and crispiness (if you get them toasted). When you order a bagel sandwich they DO NOT SKIMP on the works.  They load it up with lox and CC you are good to go on a full stomach for the entire day.  I may actually skip lunch today. \n\nThey also renovated their shop about a year ago (learned this today) so it doesn\'t feel like a hole in the wall any more.  It is a bit off the beaten path (a couple of blacks from Penn but worth the trip if you have 30 min to spare before a train. \n\nI think they are closed on weekends so just a heads up.' u"This place is good just barely any seating cus so crowded all the time!! \nTheir bagel was like 3$ ! My friend ordered an everything bagel and I had a few bites was yummy fluffy :) satisfied! \nIt doesn't have a toilet downside.\nAmbiance is nice there are some neon sign lights!" u"With this place being in midtown I was a bit skeptical of the reviews before coming in since I usually feel that many midtown locations are hyped up for no reason.\n\nWith that said I was very much surprised. We came in on a Saturday morning and it was packed. You do have a few tables available but might have to wait for one to free up (the space is quite large for midtown but for some reason they don't have that many tables).\n\nWe got three bagels: egg and cheese on an everything bagel onion bagel with sun dried tomato spread cinnamon raisin bagel with cinnamon walnut and raisin spread.\n\nFirst things first don't roast your bagel. The bagels were fresh and had great texture without being dry and hard. We asked for the onion bagel toasted and it ruined the taste because the little bits of onion on the bagel were burnt.\n\nThe egg and cheese one was just right and the eggs were freshly cooked (I hate it when eggs are prepared in advanced). I also really enjoyed the cinnamon raisin combination. Ideally it's good to get a sweet option along with a salty option. Size wise they were massive!" u'From when I started in line to getting my whole wheat everything bagel with Lox spread was 16 minutes and 53 seconds. The line went quick especially since the line started out the door.\n\nI thought it was overall a good bagel and if I am by Times Square this is where I would probably go. The coffee seemed overpriced but I did like that people could get cartons of orange juice reminded me of the simpleness of childhood.  \n\nSuggestion: It seemed to me that by the chips over by the garbage can by the door there was room for my tables. I think you could fit another table or two to accommodate more patrons since there were people eating outside in the rain.\n\nWill most likely try the low fat lox spread next time but do plan on visiting again.' u"I really enjoyed the bagels and coffee here that I came back here back to back days. I would have done a third visit too but it may have been too much. The lines can get long and I don't have any tips of when to go but both times I went it was at least a 5-7 mins wait and this was around 9am and 10am the other day. I really missed my NYC bagels so I found this one closest to my airbnb. They make their bagels on the premise too and there are several choices to choose from. Also they have a wide selection of cream cheese. My colleagues got their lox spread for bagels and loved it. I got my standard sesame with scallion cream cheese and man was it delicious. The bagel had a perfect chewy-ness to it and it was delicious. I didn't even need to toast it. I'm drooling over in Cali and I'm dreaming of a NYC bagel. Oh how I miss thee..." u"The name says it all and I have to agree with them. I have been coming here since my first trip to NY and always find myself coming back. I haven't tried that many other big-name bagel shops but this one reigns.\n\nThe bagels themselves are dense yet fluffy chewy yet soft. They get them right. As an added bonus they are huge! I love breakfast sandwiches and my go-to is bacon egg and cheese on a whole wheat everything bagel. It is literally the best thing ever.\n\nThe first time I came I was a bit confused. First you have to order your food from a man deeper in the store (it has been the same man even from a year ago). Then you head to the cashier who is closer to the door (also has been the same lady haha). From the lady you can also order your coffee or tea. Best bagels in Midtown!" u'I see why this place is always crazy busy. The name suits them. It definitely worth the 30 min wait. They have about any type of bagel you could possibly want and all the fillings to go with it. They have about twenty spreads from sweet and savory also you can make build a breakfast bagel or a lunch bagel with an assortment of boars head meats and cheeses. \n\nWe ordered the garlic bagel with garlic spread wheat bagel with pb & j and a everything bagel with bacon egg and cheese. The bagels were fantastic. They were dense and chewy soft and crispy. All the flavors were spot on and the fillings were dynamite. Best bagels for sure.' u"The name is right best bagel. I got pastrami (the king) of all lunch meats on a pumpernickel bagel one word FANTASTIC. The bagel was soft inside and crisp on top. The pastrami was boars head a great brand of lunch meat. The Swiss cheese was melted perfectly on top and touch of deli mustard. Got a bootle of Coke and a bag of miss Vicks sea salt chips. Will be back again for sure. Came back three more times. Just can't believe the how consistent this place is I got the egg and bacon on the everything bagel twice then I got the turkey club both fantastic . The egg and bacon the bacon was crisp and the egg perfectly cooked . The bagel was soft and spiced perfectly. The club was Boars head smoked turkey tomato bacon lettuce and mayo on an everything bagel . Big sandwich with big taste. The staff here are so friendly." u'A definite NYC bagel must. Loved the vegan cream cheese option \nLove the vegan cream cheese option! Thank you! \nLine went quickly on a busy morning' u"Was visiting NY for work and knew I had to get a bagel for breakfast. I had a day to walk around the city and for my itinerary this bagel place was a mix of within my walking path and good reliable Yelp reviews.\n\nWednesday morning the line didn't go out the door but it was just about to the door inside. However as others mentioned this place works so efficiently that the line goes pretty quick. It wrapped from the door to the ordering counter and back to the register but I was only in line for probably 15 minutes total. \n\nI ordered a breakfast bagel of bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel as well as an iced coffee. I like my coffee black and the flavor from the coffee was just how I like it! The bagel itself was warm and perfectly toasted while still having  a good chewy interior. The bacon egg and cheese themselves were really good as well! The bagel is a good size and they definitely live up to their name!\n\nThere's some indoor seating and I was able to get space at a stand up table on the side. They also offer more than just bagels like pastries sandwiches etc. I definitely want to return to this place if I'm ever back in NYC!" u"They expanded their shop so now there's more seating inside but don't even think about planning to eat at a table on the weekends.  We were there around 11am on a Saturday and there was ~25 people ahead of us.  It only took about 20 minutes before we were eating our bagels on the sidewalk with everyone else who couldn't find a seat inside.\n\nIt's totally worth the wait and I will come back again and again." u"I was staying across the street from this cute little place. I found the reviews on yelp and I decided to go for breakfast one morning. This place ran like a machine lol.\n\nWe were a little scared that the wait would be long since the line was out of the door. But the line moved very quickly. I don't think I was waiting in line for longer than 5 to 7 minutes. \n\nThey was a vast number of bagels and spreads to choose from. I'm thinking at least 10 of each or more. There were also options to get bagel sandwiches. The first time I was there I choose a garlic bagel with regular cream cheese egg bacon and cheddar. The bagel was amazing! It even had bits of garlic on it. Trust me you need to get them toasted. \n\nThe second time I went I got an onion bagel with garlic cream cheese. Again I was not disappointed. \n\nI'm thinking that the sandwich was around $5 and the bagel with spread was around $4. The restaurant was tiny not a lot of sitting place yet there is always a full house. The workers are busy yet helpful. I would definitely suggest checking this place out." u'Line is long cash register guy very brash frankly I don\'t know what the fuss is all about Re these bagels. I\'ve had equally good bagels at Einstein\'s or at a street vendor\'s cart. \n\nI really don\'t want to or mean to go poo-poo on someone\'s establishment like this but once you\'ve become "big and mighty" or popular it\'s important to keep service up and pay attention to the "little guys". This bagel & coffee joint has forgotten about that. I' u'My last stop in NY and I had to go out with a bang! \n15 minites away from my hotel and I had to come in to try the bacon egg and cheese and the turkey club. I loved each bagel on its own. The bacon egg and cheese was so moist and delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked and the bacon had a nice sharp bite. The cheese was a tad bit overwhelming but overall an awesome sandwich. The turkey club was fresh filling and good! The bacon and turkey combined did come off as a little salty at times but the tomato did help cut that down a notch. \nSeats are difficult to find and even when you are waiting for a table to open up it may be dirty and you have to clean it yourself.'],-0.4019,0.084,0.748,0.168
103.Ramen Sanshiro,[u"Not too busy. Has AC (which is important during the summer months in NYC). \nNice servers who are respectful and refill your water cups often. \nOnly compliant is that the ramen takes a while...so make sure you're not in a rush when you come here. Had my cup of water refilled 3-4 times before we got our ramen. And oh yeah... CASH only. I believe their daytime and evening menu are different so make sure you ask.\nWe ordered the dumplings that came out piping hot and pan seared as well as the SPiCY MISO ramen (thicker in broth) and SHOYU ramen (more of a clear broth). Both were very flavorful and delicious! One of my family members thought it was a little too salty but being that I love flavor...I really enjoyed it! \nAlready finished the meal and wanting more..." u"The ramen was salty.\n\nMy gripe is that we've literally finished eating 20 minutes ago and we're still waiting for our check. We've tried flagging down the waiter we've asked for the check but he's still ignoring us. \n\nService sucks." u"The Last Bastion of late night NYC Ramen Joints is still Standing!! \n\nFor a while NYC had an awesome little collection of late night ramen joints. Sadly so many of them have closed down including this Gem of all Gems which reopened at this location and has come back better than ever! \n\nRamen Sanshiro has grown to be one of my absolute favorite Ramen overall and currently my favorite of the late night options \n\nYou can't go wrong with anything here especially given your options at this time of night.  Start yourself out with some piping hot Gyoza. Wonderfully thin wraps and good flavors inside. \n\nNow let's move on to the main event. Sanshiro is not a complex bowl of ramen. It's beauty lies in its simplicity and quality. It all starts with the Noodles I'm not sure if these are sun noodles or home made but wherever they are getting their stuff it's definitely up there with the best. I've ordered their noodles Uncooked for take out orders and the quality is very apparent.  The noodles have a nice thickness and very satisfying texture. \n\nThe star of the show is their broths. These are some of the best broths you can get in this city. They do an excellent job balancing the weight of the broth. What you get is a broth that's not overly rich but still has those essential pockets of fat with that porky flavor. \n\nThe Shoyu broth has cloves of garlic that have been rendered to a crisp texture. Every time you slurp a pile of noodles and bite into one of the crispy cloves it's like heaven in your mouth. \n\nThe Sio Broth is just as good as the Shoyu. It's a bit more fatty and rich and has a little more complexity to it. If you have tried the fattiest broth at the uber popular and uber expensive ichiran this will probably be reminiscent of it though in my opinion a far superior version\n\nThe Miso is an All Star too. It stands up with the best of the miso broths in the city. The fermented broth is a burst of flavor and is a great option if you're hungrier and want something more filling. \n\nAll of the other ingredients are well done but pretty standard fare. The scallions and veggies are fresh and the pork is well made. \n\nDoesn't hurt that the guys that run this shop are so incredibly friendly and attentive.  \n\nBottom line If you want an AUTHENTIC  ramen bowl great service and are wandering around late at night this is the only place you need in your life" u"Okay. I still don't understand why more than a half of tables were filled.  It took forever to get our food and food was horrible horrible horrible... Noodle wasn't even fully cooked; It felt like chewing rubber strings. I wonder why there is only one negative review on this place. It was just an awful experience... \n\nDO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE IF YOU CARE ABOUT FOOD AND YOUR MONEY. SERIOUSLY!!!" u"I'm from Southern California where ramen places are pretty much a popular hotspot for anyone who wants their Japanese fix so I'm pretty picky on my ramen. However visiting New York I had pretty high hopes for the food in Manhattan.\n\nI say pass this place.\n\nI waited a good forty minutes or my miso and shio ramen which is very odd considering ramen is a pretty fast prep kind of meal. For $12 I was throughly disappointed with the small portion of lukewarm ramen. It wasn't piping hot and full of flavor and I finished the damn thing in about five bites. The pork was okay but I've had better. \n\nService was nonexistent. They seemed like they were having a hard time with some new system so they were spending more time on that than on the customers. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to tourists like me or even regulars. I had to eat from a food vendor afterwards to feel full." u"If I didn't know better I would have thought I was back in Japan. From the laminated menus with pictures to the food advertisements on the walls to the cash only policy (still ubiquitous in Japan - even at many high-end places) Ramen Sanshiro screams authenticity! If I was a little worried at the reasonable prices I should not have been- the ramen is on par with what you will find in Japan. The spicy ramen will open sinuses but is not overpowering and the shoyu ramen has the delicate taste of soy without feeling you are eating a salt lick. I did not get to try anything else but all around me I heard the sounds of satisfaction. I will definitely return whenever I am in NYC!" u"Great late night spot for some of the best ramen. The pork is perfectly cooked and is by far the best that I've had at any of the ramen restaurants in midtown west" u'This ramen is very authentic remind me of Japan! You should give a try shouyu ramen. It has very delicate flavor!!!'],0.3333,0.372,0.628,0.0
79.Legasea Seafood Brasserie,[u'Highly recommend!  My girlfriend and I went to Legasea for a 6:45PM reservation on a Saturday evening and had the best time!\n\nAmbiance:  \nVery trendy as is such with the Tao Group restaurants.  Decor was almost identical to CatchNYC in MePa.  Restaurant was busy but not too crowded at that time.    \n\nFood:\nFood was delicious!  We ordered the calamari and the trio dip for appetizers and had the Red Snapper and Fish and Chips for our main dishes.  The fish was so tender flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Best part is that it came in HUGE proportions so bring your appetite!  \n\nBonus:  The bread rolls were so buttery rich!  I could have filled up on those alone!   \n\nService:  \nService was impeccable.  The wait staff was kind and very attentive.  They offered great suggestions.' u"Didnt know about this place until my inlaw's relative invited us here for dinner. It is tucked away from bustling tourists and when we came here on a sunday night it wasnt very crowded. They have coat service and the ambiance was between casual-upscale in my opinion. \n\nWe were still very full from lunch so we didnt order much from the entree selections. The servings for the fried calamari was good enough to share for 3-4 people however taste wise i think i've had better. The bread starters were very good they were light fluffy and buttery which instantly reminded me of a croissant. Next i complimented their tuna tartar which had very good flavor; was very fresh and tasty. My husband had the spicy crab beignets and those were pretty delicious. They came in four pieces almost like the size of a french macaroon but only thicker from the crab meat. Surprisingly despite the sweetness of the beignets the crab meat blended very well with the dough." u"Good place to eat and hang that's away from all the touristy places in Times Square. From the couches lighting seating and ambience of the place- it has such an evening chic vibe. They bring out the best buttered buns  for the table with sweet pickles and cold slaw. For my experience we ordered all the unhealthy stuff like Mac and cheese bread spreads fried chicken biscuits and fries. Everything was buttery tasty and filling! The fried chicken was just okay but the fries were super crispy and the Mac and cheese was one of the best I've ever had. The banana pie dessert was not good however - stay away from that. It had no flavor. Afterwards we went up to their roof top bar which was also beautiful and chill." u"I'm staying at The Moxy and was so happy to dine at Legasea. The bartender was very kind and personable. The Foxy Moxy cocktail was almost too pretty to drink very delicious! I ate the spicy crab beignets they were unlike anything I've had before. Crazy delicious! Do yourself a favor and dine here." u'New restaurant owned by Tao group at Moxie Hotel. Awesome food awesome chill vibes they have a bar area restaurant area relaxed lounge area with foosball table. Place is pretty large. Next door is Magic Hour which is a nice rooftop bar great for weekend after dinner drinks. Food was actually really good. The bread they start you with was so soft and delicious that I asked them to give me half a dozen to go! I think this place is going to be a big hit especially because everything else is condensed into meatpacking this gives an alternative to those living closer to midtown east. Highly recommend!!' u'Excellent new modern upscale approach to seafood. Beautiful decor. A little on the noisy side but not too much. I opened with an amazing golden beet salad with champagne vinaigrette. Then luscious got tuna tartare with avocado served with flatbread crisps. My entree was seared scallops with a farro salad. Modest portions...modest wine list. Good service. Highly recommend!' u"This was my favorite restaurant during our nyc trip. While the seafood did look amazing I'm a vegetarian and the salads and appetizers were delicious! The dip trio was the best thing on the menu. And you have to make your own sundae for dessert! Definitely share with at least 4 people that thing is huge. Great wine selection and atmosphere. Check out the roof bar afterwards." u"Throwing the 5 bomb to my old friends at Tao Group. One of the best Seafood meals I have had in a long time..The large tower was ridiculous!! Great service drinks/wine and dessert. Reasonable Prices..Trendy scene but more subtle than other hot spots... Can't wait to come back!" u'Great food and amazing service.    Had a birthday party of 12.   Definitely would recommend this place' u'Legasea is great addition to Midtown West! It has an excellent vibe and wait staff.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Roasted Crab Claws Large Shrimp and Tempura Squash as appetizers.  My girlfriends and I also indulged in a signature cocktails that were more sugary than expected.  We were curious as to why there was chicken and biscuits on the menu and that was our least favorite item ordered.  After dinner we took a walk to the Magic Hour Lounge and boy oh boy what a gem!!! Very fresh and playful scene.  These additions to the TAO Group are sure to be the talk of town.' u'The food is excellent and the ambiance was great. However it took them 45 minutes to take our order and over two and a half hours to get our food. Each time we ordered a round of drinks that also took between 30-40 minutes. We had to complain a few times until eventually the manager came and comped us a round of drinks and our entrees. Certainly they acted appropriately and were very apologetic however someone at our table had a similar experience three weeks prior. Would be a great spot if they can get their act together!' u'Absolutely the best restaurant i have eaten in nyc. I come here often and am always looking for a new place. Apparently they just opened. Eclectic menu something for everyone. Ps. Part of the tao restaurant group. Cant go wrong.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
160.Souvlaki GR,[u"My team and I ordered lunch from here last week. First of all delivery was only a 30 minute wait which is awesome.\n\nI had the pita chicken sandwich which had tatziki tomatoes fries. It was really good. \n\nMy coworkers got salads that came with extra pita bread and we couldn't get enough of it. Lots of flavor warm fresh.\n\nGood prices too!\n\nI would definitely recommend." u"Not the greatest Greek place I've been too especially for the price but their tatziki with pita bread was very good and the octopus was good as well though somewhat over cooked. The gyro was also pretty good.\n\nGiven the midtown location it gets very busy and very loud especially during lunch time and given the fact that the place is pretty small. \n\nIt does have a very cool vibe to it almost feels like you're sitting outside while you're inside." u'Did not honor reservation. Showed up on time and was greeted with "wait outside and I\'ll call your name." Waited 30 minutes. Asked again and was told 10 more minutes. When we expressed displeasure we were given a restaurant business 101 speech. \n\nRestaurant\'s priorities are 1. Walk ins 2. Various delivery services like Uber and Caviar 3. Treating those with a reservation like dirt.' u'My friend and I were so disappointed with our first time experience here this evening.  Whether I give one or five stars is irrelevant as there was a line out the door when we left. Apparently it works for many patrons.\nSince my friend passed by Souvlaki Gr on numerous occasions in the past she suggested we check it out for dinner.\nTonight we did just that. I arrived first at around 5:40 whereupon it wasn\'t packed (yet).  The hostess informed me that there might not be any availability and asked me to wait at the bar. I did. There were many vacant tables but she said they were reserved. Shortly thereafter my friend arrived and we were quickly seated to our table in cramped close quarters. Hmmm--raised eyebrows\nWe were in the midst of catching up a bit but felt rushed by the waitress at the start to place our order. We needed to view the menu!\nWe inquired about house wine by the glass and after a small sample of the white Greek wine made with pine and not grapes we selected something similar to Pinot Grigio. At first we were informed of the wine serving size (fine with us after observing it on other tables) and was nearly encouraged to get a bottle. No thanks we just wanted one glass.\nAfter a few questions about the food menu we decided to try a hot  pita sandwich.  Mine was vegetarian while my friend selected lamb. Upon arrival both sandwiches were served on one small plate. No garnish or side salad. Just the sandwiches.\nAt first I thought it was my friend\'s meal because each sandwich was very small.\nMy pita sandwich was good but there was hardly any vegetables in it. I was quite underwhelmed and my friend and I still felt hungry after we finished.\nKeep in mind no olives or complimentary bites were set on the table as many restaurants offer something whether bread olives etc.\nStill contemplating whether to order more food or dessert next thing we see is our check set on the table! Our waitress didn\'t ask if we wanted anything else nor did we ask for the check!\nI asked the really nice bus boy if everyone is always rushed out. He felt badly and brought a small dessert for my friend and I.  In addition there was an error on the check and we received attitude for that as in: "Oh it\'s just two dollars". That\'s not the point.\nOverall impression? This restaurant is way too busy crowded uncomfortable and with a slight attitude to even consider returning. Arriving patrons congregated at the entrance and it was challenging to get to the restroom and/or even leave. Dining out need not be such a hassle.\nThe atmosphere was cute and the food (mainly what was being brought to other tables) looked and was probably good but portions were underwhelming. It seemed to vary across entrees.\nI highly doubt I\'ll return again. I know my friend felt the same sentiment.' u"Just a little bit of Greece tucked away in Midtown East of all places! We went on a Saturday evening around 6:15 but were glad we made a reservation because the place filled up quickly soon after although tables turn over relatively quickly. \n\nThe restaurant is just as cute to look at inside as it is outside with its white and blue decor and lights strung up overhead. The staff is very friendly and efficient with taking orders refilling water etc.\n\nThey have a lot to choose from both on their drink and food menu - all of which is a great value for how much you get. I decided to go with their $8 house red wine which was a great deal. For a meal my husband and I ordered the spanakopita and the grilled meat platter for two people ($32 - on the menu as Psita tis Oras Poikilia). It was so much we couldn't eat it all but it was delicious. The spanakopita was some of the best I've had in a long time while the lamb in the meat platter just was amazing." u"Awesome interior that feels like you're in a ma & pop shop in Mykonos. \n\nThe food is good and large portions for the price. The chickpea salad is a filling and healthy entree and I like to get a chicken skewer as well. The dips are fun too - the hummus is one of my favorites and the pitas are warm and buttery. The Greek fries sound great with herbs and feta but are often soggy. \n\nFun for both a date with lots of shareable dips and for large groups." u'Food was cooked right authentic taste! I felt like I was overseas for the meal the places us right in Santorini. Highly recommend! Staff was pleasant and very accommodating food delish prices reasonable.' u"Service was good - the guy was really quick to take our order and super attentive but he wasn't the nicest. He didn't like answering questions about the food - maybe most of the customers here are very familiar with the food so he just wasn't accustomed to customers asking questions. \n\nInterior was so cute - SO decorated and cozy. A ma & pa shop feel with cute Greek Island decor.\n\nFood was okay. Portions were small. The meat was kind of hard to chew and maybe overcooked. I ordered stuffed peppers from the main course part of the menu and they were definitely not main course. 5 small jalapeno sized peppers stuffed with cheese (in retrospect I think they gave me the appetizer stuffed peppers but I definitely confirmed with the server that I was ordering the main course portion). \n\nThis place had solid reviews so maybe I just totally missed the mark. Since service was fast and the pita bread refills were flowing I would be down to give this place another try." u"The waiter who greeted us was so sweet and he was probably my favorite thing about this place. The service is a bit slow but they don't urge you to eat more or anything and they check on you only when needed. \n\nI had a souvlaki pita with lamb with spicy sauce thing and it was short and sweet - small in quantity but big in flavor. Seriously love lamb. ($9.75?)\n\nI also tried moussaka (?) for the first time. Huge chunk of food. It was like layers of meat and peppers topped with whipped potato and cheese mixture. I could be totally wrong but it tasted like it and I enjoyed it. ($18?)\n\n They have wifi for those visiting or lacking data so you can ask for the password if needed :)" u"I love Greek food and so when looking for a place to grab a quick pre-theatre bite that was close to our hotel Souvlaki GR seemed like a no brainer. \n\nThis cute little Greek restaurant looks as though it was ripped right out of the heart of Greece and taste like it too. Delicious fresh Greek food and at a reasonable price.\n\nThe place is quite intimate so it's great for friends. The staff is very friendly too.\n\nBut the food is where this place shines. Deliciously fresh ingredients abound. The portions are great too not too much not too little. Unfortunately I was a feeling a little under the weather so didn't eat a whole lot but what I tasted was excellent and everyone else I travelled with loved the food.\n\nI can't wait to come back again!" u'A big fan of this fresh and tasty Greek cuisine. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are visiting the Greek islands in real life!' u'This place is great! Been here multiple times as I was traveling to NYC. Really good Greek food! So far I have only had the kalamakia (chicken and beef both great) the Revithosata (chickpea salad) and my absolute favorite the lamb chops!!! Oooh man the lamp chops are my favorite so flavorful and come with pita and Tzatziki (yogurt-cucumber) sauce.....highly recommend!' u"100% authentic delicious Greek food. Hummus is arguably the best in the city and their pita is served perfectly warm and seasoned.\n\nI had the seared octopus and various meat skewers; all were rock solid. Wine list had a lot of excellent Greek choices particularly the Assyrtiko.\n\n10/10 would return. Service was helpful and attentive. Place is cramped but in a good way feels like you're transported to a European cafe." u'I have been here a few time for lunch and the food never disappoints.  I typically order the SGR pita with chicken.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned and the pits is to die for!  In addition the entree you must have the baklava.  It simply melts in your mouth.' u"We went to this restaurant after seeing the play Chicago it was a nice walk and it is located across from Carnegie Hall.  This was the most authentic and delicious Greek food I have every eaten to date.  So worth the trip.  Some things to note... It is a very small venue extremely close seating and gets filled/crowded at dinner.  We arrived at 5:15ish (earlier than our 6:00 pm reservations) and they took us right away which was to our benefit as it got filled by the time we were leaving. \n\nHaving read the menu before we knew what we wanted to try and order and it was to our table fast hot and absolutely delicious.  The pita bread was warm soft and fresh.  I cannot even describe the feta cheese.  It is not the store bought cheese that I've only eaten.  Just amazing.  \n\nMy order consisted of:  1)  Hand-Cut Greek Fries Sprinkled with feta cheese and seasoned with Greek oregano;  2)  Bifteki Gemisto - Two handmade Greek burgers stuffed with Greek cheeses scallion and dill;  3)  chick pea salad chick peas onions feta cheese olive oil; 4) lamb gyro which was a perfect size and it came with french fries tucked in the pita;  and 5)  a glass of red wine which was served in small water glasses - a very good portion and delicious.  It ended with Loukoumades - Fried dough drizzled with honey walnuts and cinnamon for dessert.  It came with 8 of them - this portion was a bit much for two people but we managed.  \n\nWill go back many times in the future!" u"I visited Souvlaki GR for the first time last week - I was craving Greek food! My media partners and I went out for a celebratory business lunch and we had such a blast! \n\nFood/Drinks: All in all the food was amazing! I personally enjoyed the lamp chops (medium well) I ordered; they were very well grilled and seasoned. We ordered about 5/6 bottles of rose which was also great. At one point we got a bottle on the house! Check out the pics of the different plates we ordered. \n\nStaff: Our waiters were beyond charming! Angelo recommended the lamp chops and I'm glad I took it. Alex was very friendly and told us about his Greek background and experience there. They both went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. \n\nVibe/Decor: The Midtown location was smaller than I expected but still nicely decorated. We felt like we were in a small part of Greece! :) \n\nI highly recommend this spot! It makes for a great date spot. :)" u"Very busy spot in an area with few good choices. On a Thursday at 6:30p the place was already packed so make a reservation. \n\nVery cute decor with lots of character. Good for a date although a tad loud. \n\nWe got three spreads: hummus eggplant and garlic and they were good and plenty. \n\nTheir zucchini croquettes are tasty. \n\nThe SGR Arni Souvlaki Pita (with lamb and spicy feta) is ok although the pita does overwhelm every other flavor. \n\nTheir donuts are forgettable: the dough wasn't completely cooked and was flavorless. Sure you're supposed to give it flavor by dipping it in the honey but the two of them didn't quite go well. It wasn't a good choice. \n\nOverall it's a good spot to go if you're hungry in the neighborhood. You do feel rushed by the service but considering the line of people waiting I guess it's understandable." u"I've been to both souvlaki GR locations and every time I visit it brings back memories of being in Greece again. I also feel like I'm in Greece! \n\nThe souvlaki's taste great (but way more expensive than Greece) but can be on the small side. So you're probably going to need to order a side or an appetizer if you get the souvlaki. \n\nI also got the spicy feta dip which was tasty and definitely a little spicy. But I think they add salt or something to the pita so it tasted a bit salty. \n\nLove it here and will be returning again and again!" u"Review for delivery: I placed an order through delivery.com. I ordered 3 dips and extra pita bread to go with dips. The restaurant sent the dips but not the pita bread. I attempted to call the restaurant numerous times to rectify the situation but their phone was busy each time. I ended up calling delivery.com who also couldn't get through. As a result they were only able to give me credit and not a refund for the dips and pita bread. \n\nSave your money! Much better and less expensive Greek restaurants in the area." u"The food is delicious and the delivery is always quick. When I go into the restaurant the service is speedy with a smile. Can't say enough about these good folks!"],0.4926,0.347,0.653,0.0
55.Crossroads American Kitchen & Bar,[u"Came here for a night with two of my girlfriends. We started at the bar near the windows that looked out over Times Square. The waiter there unfortunately I forget his name was really bad. It took him 10 minutes to bring us a bottle of wine that we ordered and he knew we only had 30 mins before our dinner reservation. I had asked for the bill and he left it but didn't come back to check on us or get the bill until I motioned to him 15 mins later. \n\nHowever things turned around at dinner. We were promptly sat and had Morgan as our waitress. Morgan was an amazing! She was great. Kudos to her. \n\nI had a cheeseburger with fries which was absolutely delicious. My friends had grilled chicken and the hummus plate. All of our food was really good. We had two bottles of wine while at the establishment and had a great time. Would definitely go back and would absolutely recommend this place if you are going to a broadway show! Amazing and perfect location in Times Square while not feeling annoyed by Times Square!" u"I came here with colleagues for a business lunch and overall we had a solidly positive experience. We had pre-ordered meals but Amtrak delays forced us to delay our arrival. I had the In and Out trio with a turkey sandwich chicken noodle soup and watermelon salad. The salad was really nice; with enough feta to add accent to the arugula but not enough to overpower it. The watermelon was VERY good; and I'm not even that into watermelon. The turkey was moist and could almost even have been slow cooked from the flavor. \n\nWhile they tried to push us into the buffet option which we didn't want the service was overall good. We will be using the Marquis for some business conferences so I'll probably find myself here in the future!" u"Its a Marriott in the middle of TS so yeah there is way better food for the price for breakfast though if you are like me and in the mood for shelled pistachios and walnuts it kinda makes up for it. The salmon was fine. Rest of the food was ok outside of a spinach dumpling that was pretty good.\n\nIn short worth it if you are nuts. I wouldn't go out of my way" u"I'm going to agree with most other people who reviewed this place: 3 stars because of service. We came in as a group of 4 all ordered the bacon cheeseburger and they made a mistake on almost all of them.. nothing crazy but it's sad that she couldn't take a simple order during a time when there weren't many customers. \n\nTwo people got the wrong fries meat wasn't cooked enough she handed people who ordered avocado with their burgers to the wrong person... Having worked in a restaurant I know servers should have at least a general idea of who ordered what. Quite disappointing for a restaurant that should have higher standards for its location. \n\nThe view is great there's tables located right next to the window so you can see the view of Times Square. We sat at this circular table the restaurant really is set up beautifully. Which is a shame as to why the service is so bad! \n\nThe food itself was good. I'm not super particular on how my meat is cooked unless it's really dry or way too red. The sweet potato fries were yummy. I'd probably try a different place in TImes Square if I were looking to dine with a view." u'This restaurant is part of Marriot Marquee.I have been here couple of times and never disappointed !\n\nWe ordered the Salmon. It was just awesome. The salmon comes with rissotto.The combination is just great.\n\nAwesome = Glass of wine+Salmon+Rissotto\n\nWill certainly recommend this place !' u'Pleasantly surprised with how phenominal the food was here the steak was juicy and perfectly medium rare like we ordered.  Melted like butter!  Highly recommend this place!  Local beer selection is small but on point.  Service was good and quick.  Loved it!' u"We had an excellent experience.  Friendly waitress. The coffee was strong and we enjoyed several cups. I had the oatmeal fruit and bagel and juice. Husband had scrambled eggs meat hash browns.  All the food was well prepared and served hot.  It's in the Marriott Marquis. You are paying for convenience. $60 for breakfast including tip." u"Went here for breakfast 2 mornings on my weekend vacation.  The food was very pricey and limited.\n\nOnce you sit down you are instantly poured a glass of orange juice... which I hope you like because they're charging you $6/glass whether you ask for it or not.  Next coffee is $6/cup or $12/pot.\n\nI had the belgian waffle which I liked but for $19 the quality could have been a little bit better.  The 2nd day I had the breakfast platter with eggs bacon toast etc.  It was very basic and for a cost of $29.50 was pretty under thought.\n\nService is a bit slow as there are lots and lots of tables and few servers." u'Two stars are generous-- our server rallied at the end to redeem an extra star. The hostess forgot to call us and after we reminded her we were still waiting after thirty minutes proceeded to seat us.  Our food took thirty five minutes for four of the items one of which was screwed up.  The fifth item came five minutes later.  The sandwich bread was too crunchy.  The chips were literally all crumbs. The staff smiled and were generally nice but we were there for the food. High potential in this world class location extremely poor execution with high prices.  \n\nInexcusable for this caliber of hotel.' u"Try the brick chicken salmon burger or the chicken pot pie (Wednesday's only). Delicious food and the staff are very nice and accommodating. 10/10!" u"Terrible fucking place  One star review for these assholes who almost refused to serve me because I am 16 years old The most horrendous woman Sonya or Sanya Harass me into where my parents were How was in charge and That I couldn't pay with my room number even though I repeatedly told her that I was going to pay with Cash. I told him I was in a school trip so therefore my parents were not present and That all I wanted was to have a quick breakfast before my group left They forced me to show them one of my teachers. When I finally ordered a simple bowl of Oatmeal with a Double Roast expresso. 21$ For that simple breakfast! After chugging the expensive bill down my throat I payed with a 50$ bill and Only received 18$ in return before I complained and got my Additional 10$\nTerrible Service Ok food Atrocious atmosphere" u"Extremely slow service but food was good. Should have left after we waited 20 minutes for anyone to stop by our table. Took over 15 minutes for someone else to bring our drinks to the table (water and soda not even anything form the bar). Our waiter dropped off some rolls and said he'd be right back to take our order. Another 15 minutes later we flagged someone down to please take our food order because we had time constraints. Of course it was a half hour until our food started to arrive - a few plates at a time. I don't know what happened to the wait staff because the chef was running  food out to the tables when he should have been in the kitchen cooking. We had to take some of it to go because at this point we had to leave." u"Truly the worst service I have ever received here. The prices are outrageous and the food is mediocre at best. \n\nHave been staying at this hotels for 5 days and have given this place about 4 chances now out of convenience. I can truly say it takes A LOT to write a bad review and out of the 4 times coming here they haven't proved theirselves decent once. \n\nWhether it is waiting over 25 minutes each time to order a drink or food from the cocktail waitress- which the bartender will not serve you or let you order if yo do not sit at the bar so your have to wait. Keep in mind they are not that busy either. \n\nWhat we ordered never came out right. Not sure how you get a sandwich mixed up with dumplings for example. Everyone at our table (5 of us) all heard what we ordered and the cocktail waitress still brought us out dishes we didn't order and made us pay for them. \n\nThe place is filthy too all the chairs and couches have stains all over them. It is gross. A little cleaning wouldn't hurt!\n\nHuge disappointment and would not recommend this place ever again. Definitely need to step it up!\n\nP.S. Talked to a manager to try and see their side before posting this review and they didn't care about the service at all." u'We had May as our server for a casual lunch here. This was a great place to relax get a good view of times square and grab a bite. Prices were typical for a restaurant in NYC with a view but May was the sweetest and helped us with every little request we had! My mom and I split the soup sandwich and salad which were filling and pretty good for food.' u"I am usually a bit weary of dinner at hotels.  I find often they seem to have lower standards and higher prices than stand alone restaurants.  However we had traveled and was tired we just didn't feel like finding a place to eat before our show and since we were staying at the hotel it was a good choice.\n\nMy daughter had salad and my other daughter had a burger and fries.  I had tuna cooked rare.  Everything was delicious.  It was all cooked very well.  I asked for my tuna rare and it came out still cool in the center exactly how I like it.  Dinner with my glass of wine was $95.  I don't consider that bad for the excellent service the good food and the convenience of being right in the hotel.  I would easily eat here again.  It was a very relaxing dinner." u"I happened to get a comped buffet here. I had a chance to look at the menu & saw that the buffet I was getting was $35. When seeing that price I almost fell out of my seat. Then I naturally expected the buffet to have a wide variety of foods. It wasn't out of the norm though that I've experienced elsewhere. For that price though coming from Vegas where lunch & dinner buffets where there are numerous more options it did not match up. Even in Vegas a breakfast buffet is 50% of that price IN a casino.\nFor what they had at the buffet that had all the usual suspects cereals eggs bacon sausage oatmeal toast bagels muffins fruits yogurt & a few other things I'm missing. Drink wise you had 3 types of mini Naked juices milk orange juice & water from what I can remember. \nThe place was clean & the staff was ok. It is not the best bang for your buck." u'Very very slow service and food took hella long to come out. The meals on the menu were deceiving. $20 salmon hamburger my ass. Non alcoholic cocktails were just smoothies -___-' u"Food was not hot nor was it good! The service was worse than the food. The server brought me the wrong drink. She had an argument with another server right in front of my table and was obviously mad when she took my order. After my food was served by the kitchen staff she never returned to check on my meal. In coming to NY yearly for 15 years this was the first bad experience I've had." u'This place is very expensive I guess because is inside of the marquis.  The menu was small and we ended up ordering a stake sandwich salad with Gouda cheese and cheesecake.   I was surprised the food was five stars  highly recommend' u'This is great spot to have lunch / casual meal. The piece is reasonable for what they offer. We had a sandwich sale and soup. It was filling fresh and the waiter was very nice. We will be back again.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
50.Nippori,[u"This place is located right across the street from Gershwin Theatre so after watching Wicked we were ready to try a new ramen place. We walked on over and they sat us down immediately. I was happy this place closed late because most places were already closed by the time we got here.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and they gave us some suggestions as to what ramen we we should try. They had a bar area and Tv's were could watch the game playing. For appetizer we had the Gyoza for $7. We ordered the Sutamina Ramen for $13. The ramen was pretty good not the best I've tried it was tasty. For our beer we had the Sapporo Draft. \n\nI had a great time here the food was decent and even though we stopped by an hour before closing time I never felt like we were rushed to eat or finish. Definitely a good place to try." u"Came here dejectedly after finding out both Totto and Ippudo had an hour plus wait times (at 9:30pm no less though I suppose it was a Friday...and we're in New York after all...but still!). \n\nWe instantly perked up as steaming bowls of ramen were plopped down in front of us. I was pleasantly surprised by my order of the samurai ramen! The broth was full of umami and had a creamy texture and the black garlic added depth of flavor with a nice mild caramelized finish. Although the chashu was rather mediocre and dry the soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked and had the perfect consistency. The portion size was quite large as well as I definitely struggled to finish it. In addition to the ramen we ordered a sashimi set to share; it was fresh and adequate not much to write home about since the ramen is 100% the star of this place.\n\nQuantity to price ratio was definitely spot on; for $16 it can't get much better than this in the city! Next time you're slapped in the face with hours long wait times at the usual ramen haunts give this overlooked diamond in the rough a chance." u"Didn't set out to eat at Nippori but ended up here around 9:30 on a Friday night. I was very pleasantly surprised! \n\nI ordered the Samurai Ramen and quite enjoyed it. The broth was rich and creamy and the noodles had a great texture. The added black garlic elevated the whole dish. Unfortunately the pork that topped the ramen was flavorful but rather tough. One of my favorite parts of the dish was actually the egg -- it was well seasoned and perfectly soft-boiled.\n\nNot the best bowl of ramen I've had in NYC but it's a good alternative." u"This place is casual. You can get a quick bite or go for happy hour. All the food I had was good service was good and ambiance was good as well. Nothing will wow you but you will have a good meal and a good time if you are with good company of course. It's also a place that if you go by yourself you will feel comfortable. \n\nI highly recommend the steam buns stuffed with pork belly. The MR. Smith specialty sushi roll was fresh. I would definitely go back to try their Ramen. \nIf you are in the area hungry and looking for a casual place to eat then this is a fine option." u"Popular Happy Hour spot with drink specials ($5 cocktails $3 Sapporo drafts etc) available everywhere not just at the bar. They also have app specials with certain items 20% off such as the steamed pork belly buns which had really excellent bacony flavor in those pillowy soft buns. The Kara-age was large chunks of crispy fried boneless chicken thighs - goes well with a nice cold Sapporo.\n\nThe Kani salad is all Kani and Kewpie mayo no cucumber in this as usually found elsewhere topped with chunks of avocado. We had a couple of rolls which I found pricey I would probably avoid these next time but they were perfectly fine. I prefered the simple Red Dragon roll (shrimp tumpura with tuna) over the Mr. Smith which was topped with sweet thai chili sauce that I didn't care for much.\n\nPlace could use a paint job walls looked a bit scuffed and dirty. I didn't care for sitting under those bright halogen lights directly above our table (Does anyone like this why do places add  this horrible lighting?). They have Tatami rooms for private dining with a group. \n\nService was excellent with our server asking if we wanted another round at happy hour prices before the special ends - WE DID!\n\nPro-tip: Take advantage of the Yelp Cash back deal currently at 7% discount." u'Nippori will not be winning any accolades or making any "best of..." restaurant lists anytime soon. It is a solidly mediocre Japanese restaurant located in midtown west where options for good reasonably priced food is generally bleak. Thus temper your expectations and you will find Nippori serviceable. \n\nThis restaurant does have three small private rooms with Japanese screens doors I wish we had thought to reserve in advance. Other than those more atmospheric and Japanese-styled private dining spaces for larger parties the rest of the restaurant is darkly lit with wooden tables and chairs in a somewhat narrow space. \n\nThe appetizers were all underwhelming. The gyoza ($7) was mediocre and a little tough inside nasu agedashi tofu (flash-fried tofu and simmered eggplant in dashi broth $7) was bland and the shishito (saut\xe9ed green Japanese bell peppers $6) was oily and similarly flavorless. All forgettable and unsatisfying. \n\nI ordered the tan tan men ($13) a Japanese twist on the classic Sichuan dan dan noodles. This was a sesame-based ramen dish with spiced ground pork red onions and scallions. I appreciated that this was not particularly spicy. According to the waitress this is one of two of the most popular ramens; the other is the sutamina ramen which is the spiciest ramen offered. My Japanese friend ordered the sutamina ramen and rated it a 5/10. \n\nService was friendly and attentive. For a superior bowl of ramen in the area I would recommend Totto Ramen instead.' u"Wasn't exactly the best place for ramen but the the extensive menu makes up for their average noodles. Sashimi on the other hand was fresher than I expected. The staff was remarkably pleasant there is ample space to walk around; however the front door lets in gusts of wind and our napkins were constantly blown off the table so that's a design flaw.\n\nDrinks aren't their forte so you can skip them. Happy hour booze was super diluted and both margarita and cosmo tasted alike so... yeah skip." u'Note that this review is based upon an initial experience being seated and not about the food.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly host who suggested a table right by the front door.  Note that restaurant was about 25% occupied.  We shook that off and asked to be seated elsewhere so they took us to a table in the rear corner of the restaurant against a wall.  We reluctantly sat down felt some harsh lighting hitting us looked at each other and decided to go elsewhere.' u"Nippori is a great stop near the theater district.  Soups have a good flavor noodles are sufficient ambiance is cozy.  Prices are quite good for the area so if you're hungry and need a value priced soup this is your place." u'Excellent ramen must have \nVery cool ambiance and great service! Will return anytime. Very affordable and fresh veggies.' u'Sutamina and tan tan ramen. Pork belly and ground pork respectively. Had sushi here too. The service was friendly and the place was well lit. Not too bright nor dark. There were tvs at the bar. Nice atmosphere. The tan tan ramen was delicious. The egg was a little overdone. But the soup was slurp worthy. I would definitely come back.' u"Excellent Raman and that is all I have to say LOL. We stayed  at the Marriott Rennisance and really wanted a place with good Ramen.  Excellent broth and fresh noodles with spicy and sweet pork.  I'd come back again" u"I Found out that they deliver through seamless and had wanted to try this place but haven't found a friend interested. ETA was 80-93mins but it arrived after 30mins!\n\nWhat I ordered. \n\nThe steamed buns not the best I've had but still descent. Good flavors meat was cooked okay!\n\n\nThe nippori ramen- this was okay if felt like curry and ramen. Interesting taste would pass on reordering this again. By the time the order arrived the ramen noodles were rather flat? I guess it's a risk you take with ordering ramen for delivery. \n\nI hope to come in for sit down service sometimes." u"I was so happy to find this place the other night after seeing a broadway show and being starving after it finished.  It was blocks away and open late which was exactly what we needed. Once we got there it was a nicely decorated and cozy restaurant. We were seated and checked on immediately by a friendly server. \n\nI order the sutamina ramen which was so delicious! The broth was flavorful and came out nice and hot. It had a huge serving of noodles and plenty of pork to accompany it. What made it perfect though was a spicy sauce mix that the server recommended. She brought it as a side (it was an extra charge) and you could spoon in as much or as little as you wanted to satisfy your taste. Service was quick and efficient and the ramen was reasonably priced. I will definitely be going back next time I'm in time square!" u"I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and nothing beats Japanese food especially a tonkatsu teishoku (tay-show-ku) which is a meal set. It came with miso soup rice Japanese pickle and last but not least tonkatsu. You can't really go wrong with deep fried pork cutlet which came out hot sizzling and crunchy!\n\nThe reason for the 3-star is because nothing really was astounding. The miso soup rice and two slices of Japanese pickle were mediocre and standard. Although I will for sure re-visit Nippori and would recommend it to folks who are in the area it isn't a place that I'd really rave about or classify as a must-visit. I will definitely be back to try the ramen!" u"We came before watching a Broadway show. It had a happy hour which was a good deal. We got various Hh appetizers and they had a uni shooter which was decent. You can yell it's not the freshest but definitely still good. I grew up in Dalian China where we split sea urchins fresh out the ocean so I'm always looking for good ones. The sashimi was okay. The buns are mediocre. The shishito peppers were good and edemame typical. The fried chicken was okay. The food was all decent overall the beers cheap. The check came out fairly expensive but it's true of all Japanese food." u"Yaaaas best ramen in New York. Go for the one with the coconut broth; it's mouth watering. Ramen will never taste as good to you any longer. Kinda long wait but worth it !!!" u"After walking around for 15 minutes looking for a ramen store that accepts credit cards we finally come to this place. Ippudos close by but at least a 30 minute wait. This was a large ramen shop with plenty of seating.\n\nI got the spicy miso based ramen with pork belly. The broth was pretty flavorful and hearty though not spicy at all. It comes with the typical wavy ramen noodles and lots of scallions onions and a couple other ingredients. \n\nService here isn't the best and you have to flag down a waiter for everything including ordering getting water etc. The food itself though does come out relatively quickly." u'I ordered the ramen with salmon and it was nothing I expected (as in it was much better). The salmon tasted like something you would get at The Keg the presentation was very well done and the taste was very savoury. It took longer than what we expected from a ramen place but I guess that was because of how well put it was!\n\nThis place was not busy at all which was really surprising! We went here right before a broadway musical as it is only 1 block away from the theatres very convenient.' u"I went there with a group of 10 people for my friend's birthday hangout. We went there on Saturday around 5pm and we got seated within 10 mins of waiting.\n\n Happy hour is from 4-7pm and they have 20% off on selected appetizers and drinks!  I loved that! We got to share: \n\nHot appetizer: \nShrimp Tempura\nVegetable Tempura \nSteam buns \nEdamame\nCold Appetizer: \nTakowasa (with wasabi soy sauce) \n\nI got Bocce Ball and Tan Tan Men. I loved everything there but I did feel like some appetizers are over priced for its taste. I felt lenient about it because of Happy hour 20% off. \n\nI would go back during happy hour time. In terms of taste everything is perfect. \n\nThe bill came out around $200 and they automatically charge 20% gratuity fee to the bill if there are more than 6 guests."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
210.Norikoh,[u"Came for lunch on Sunday.\n\nI've had plenty of ramens from other more famous and highly reviewed ramen restaurants before and I've had difficulty finishing soups from these locations. I ordered their signature Norikoh Ramen and it wish deliciously light! Their flavors were balanced enough to make me feel full but not that way that would make one sleepy from being full. \n\nI also ordered a flight of sake and beef&asparagus skewers. Both were equally delicious.\n\nOur server was very prompt and informative. and the setting was casual and mellow. \n\nGreat experience!" u"I ordered the norikoh ramen and I'm pretty sure that the bamboo shoots used are canned. The taste resembled the smell of a yeast infection bad breath and bad fish and overpowered the entire bowl. I'm really sad because I was really craving ramen. The meat was also super grey and fatty. Not sure if that's customary or if it was a mess up but I've had ramen many times before and this by far was some of the most disappointing and bland (except for the bad breath taste) that I've ever had. \n\nI've seen some good reviews but now I'm really nervous to try anything else from this restaurant." u"Hmm the curry ramen came out to be too salty and spicy to my taste. So I gave it to my cousin. Then I ordered another miso based ramen which comes out to be nowhere near to those creamy and palatable soup I had in another Ramen place. Very very disappointed. The Ramen noodles somehow stick together and it only came with half egg a piece of fish ball little bit dry tasteless shredded chicken and some corn. The whole thing was a mistake I feel sorry for my poor stomach and I couldn't finish the whole thing...I never had Ramen that I couldn't finish not because I'm full but because how poorly tasted it is. \nOh forgot to mention how tasteless was the tartar and the salmon was not fresh. Not to mention the thin see through sashimi. The only okay thing in this entire dinner was the fried rice. But com'on! Bacon in the fried rice and all those oil and salts the cook put into for enhancing the flavor...good try good try. \nThe waiter and waitress are fine. But they did not ask how the meal was nor filled out out water...\n\nI won't go back nor recommend this place to my friends." u"First off love that this place has a check in offer because I always look for one and 99% I am disappointed. Second the ambiance is really nice. The restaurant looks surprisingly modern on the inside. Very clean and well kept.\n\nFor food I decided to get the bacon kimchi fried rice. I cannot resist bacon fried rice with a fried egg on top - it's literally heaven in a bowl! I personally like the kimchi flavoring to be stronger in my rice but I really enjoyed it. Good portions tastes delicious and price isn't too bad. Service is pretty good as well.\n\nHad a nice dinner here would come back!" u'The worst ramen ever. Meat tasted like frozen food. My friend did not like the donburi either.' u'For a Japanese Asian fusion restaurant Norikoh is pretty good with a lot of selections on the menu including some korean dishes mixed in. It offers your standard lunch special of bento boxes rolls and sushi or sashimi combos.\n\nI\'ve been here multiple times and each time I was happy and satisfied with the food I ordered. When it comes to sushi fresh ingredients (fish shellfish raw stuff) is a major factor for ratings. Obviously if a place gives you the "BIG D" it\'s bad no matter how delicious the meal was itself.\n\nOverall their rolls and bentos are solid. Their ramens and cooked food are great. The service is good and prompt servers are friendly without any bitchy resting face or attitudes.' u"This little hidden gem is just perfect for a quick bite out. Some of my favorite menu items are the wings (some of the best I've had but caution they come out HOT) the ramen soup shrimp tempura and of course the sushi pieces. The fish is always fresh and delicious. I also love that they give you the option of their wild brown rice for the rolls in place of white rice. Service is always on point and the ambiance is tiny and cozy. \nIt's a weeknight favorite for my boyfriend and me. Consistently delicious and affordable." u'I went to Norikoh for lunch with a few of my coworkers. The restaurant itself is pretty cool but the food was just alright. I feel like for the price point the food could have been a little better. \n\nI got a chicken teriyaki bento box. I came with chicken and broccoli white rice California roll and two fried veggie patties. It was all just okay nothing amazing' u'Norikoh & Tokyo Heat rolls are amazing!\nA definitely must try the staff is also quick and attentive' u'I have ordered take-out half a dozen times from Norikoh because it\'s close to my office and has a decent selection. Having said that I have to say regrettably that their food is just "mediocre."\n\nIt is true that their Norikoh ramen has good portion the ingredients overall tasty and the soup is silky and always piping hot. But it just lacks that "umpf" in their overall taste. I know that\'s a terrible description of what they lack but it is perhaps the best way to describe it. Their egg and char siu doesn\'t have as deep permeating umami seasoning and the char siu portion is rather small. Also the broth is satisfying but one-dimensional. I think they need to experiment a bit more on the authentic Japanese ramen broth among other authentic components in general. I have almost expected this because I noticed almost right away that this is one of the many Chinese-owned Japanese/Korean restaurants that have been popping up all over the US in the last decade or so. More on that on the bottom of the review if you\'re interested. \n\nToday I ordered their kimchi fried rice against my better instincts (I mean I grew up eating & making that stuff so I know what that\'s supposed to taste like) because of numerous reviews praising it and boy am I disappointed. Echoing what another reviewer said its kimchi taste was very faint and overall it was just very bland. Could\'ve used some soy sauce + broth infusion to liven/tie this thing together a bit. And I was disappointed that egg was not runny - so no chance to mix the flavor hoping to arrive at something greater. (That just rhymed!) I have 50% left and I am trudging through it out of necessity. =T No I don\'t literally mean I\'m walking through my rice.\n\nThe decor is very nice and the front lady is very welcoming but I can\'t comment more than that since I\'ve only done takeout. But I can comment on their website as I ordered through there. Overall it is a very professional and eye-pleasing site. However I found their endless scrolling menu a bit annoying. They should utilize click & roll-down menus or other types of information display scheme that makes browsing their extensive menu easier. Having an extensive menu isn\'t a bad thing but trust me when I say diners do not want to scroll down aimlessly to find their food. It also screams you\'re trying to do everything and therefore you aren\'t good at anything. \n\nNow a word about Chinese-owned Japanese/Korean restaurants. This in itself isn\'t a bad thing as it allows for different renditions of the authentic offerings but these restaurants tend to fail in grasping the subtle nuances that make up the authentic flavors almost EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I would say only like 2 out of 100 I\'ve been to gets it kind of right. To give an example they often take short cuts (e.g. spray it with teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo!) and ignore the inherent philosophies in each of those cuisines. (e.g. only use fresh fish for sushi use sliced ribeyes for bulgogi etc.) If you\'re a Japanese joint in Indiana OK maybe you can get away with it because patrons there aren\'t as diverse and likely will not be as discerning but if you\'re in the NY Tri-state area? You can\'t afford to do so because people will know. This is why I generally avoid Chinese-owned "other" cuisines unless I see natives from the country of such cuisine dining there en mass (rare). \n\nWill I order again? Probably. But it won\'t be the place I think about first when I\'m craving ramen.' u"Decent restaurant with a lot of selections on the menu. We came here on a Friday and there was no wait so we got seated right away. We decided on the following: miso marinated seabags coconut lemon shrimp sashimi entree and 2 specials rolls (salmon lover and norikoh roll). It sounds like a lot of food but my date and I cleaned it all off. \n\nOn to the food we got our sashimi and special rolls before the appetizers but we didn't care as we were both starving. The sashimi is pretty good and most importantly fresh. As for the special rolls I like the norikoh roll more than salmon lover as I find the cream cheese overpowering. The Norikoh roll was good and had a kick to it with the jalapeno in it. When the appetizers came out I tried the sea bass and it was good. The fish was tender and sweet on a bed of spinach. The coconut lemon shrimp was decent and the flavor similar to Thai cuisine spices. It's sweet and tangy which is a good combination but unexpected at a Japanese restaurant. \n\nOverall food is decent and service is good and prompt." u"Asian fusion place with an extensive menu. Came here for a sushi fix and that's exactly what I got. \n\nSalmon lover combo - ($16) the salmon was definitely fresh as it melted in my mouth. The salmon pieces were pretty generous too. \n\nNorikoh roll - ($17) perfect combination of spicy crunchy and freshness. You get pieces of tuna salmon and white tuna. It all comes together in one lovely bite with the lemon cutting through the spiciness of the jalape\xf1o at the end.\n\nHouse hot sake- larger than usual size carafe totally worth it for the price!" u"HH is just okay. $7-$9 sale beer and wine. And it only runs until $6\n\nSashimi roll was premade I learned when ordering so it came out looking a little less than fresh. The rolls select apps we had and Ramon were good.\n\nDecor was chic and the service was nice. If I was in the area I would go but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here." u"You know a place is awesome when your server gets you to try green tea ice cream with red beans ;)\n\nI had a great time with my cousin and his girlfriend at Norikoh. The service was superb and the food was really great -- and super fresh. No one spoke when our meals came to the table because we were too busy digging in!\n\nAnd of course we got talked into dessert -- as if we weren't going to be big enough after eating all that rice lol -- and boy was it Delicious!\n\nI'm a super picky eater and found myself devouring the lightly shaved green tea ice cream with whipped cream nuts  and sweetened red beans. I never thought I would enjoy something like that but am so glad my cousin chose it.\n\nAll in all Norikoh was a nice experience with reasonably-priced food." u"Ordered delivery from here twice now and both times were a decent experience.\n\nThe menu is pretty large and varied with options for just about any Asian fusion craving you may have. I've had the bulgogi bowl as well as the tan tan ramen. The bulgogi bowl was ok - the beef seemed to be of mediocre quality but the marinade was quite good. As for the tan tan Ramen the broth was a little more mild and blander than im used to. Very little spice at all. \n\nDelivery has always been prompt and I look forward to trying new things on the menu." u"I got the basic sushi dish. I enjoyed it.\n\nWe also got the free check in. I always enjoy going to a place where they honor the free check in.\n\nI'd go back." u'For some reason I expected something more than a typical Korean-owned Japanese-American spot. Nah... Norikoh is a totally conventional fusion restaurant. \n\nAll the familiar things are on the menu: sushi and sashimi combo specials shrimp tempura bento boxes chicken teriyaki... even crab rangoon and fried wontons. Maybe only come here with friends who don\'t have much experience with Japanese food and might need some encouragement to plop a California roll in their mouths. \n\nIt\'s also a good place to check up on how most Americans are introduced to Japanese food: slightly excessive maki with cream cheese and smoked salmon and people using chopsticks badly. Ramen appears on the menu and makes a good case study for how various "ethnic" foods quietly get integrated as familiar cuisine. The Korean dishes they\'ve snuck into the menu like bibimbap and kimchi fried rice are even better examples. #foodways\n\nThe place is clean and not too crowded on a Friday night.\n\nYelp check-in gets you two free skewers. The bacon-wrapped scallop was one of the better bites we had that night. The chicken meatball was fine - tsukune usually comes with raw egg yolk for dipping but like the rest of the menu Norikoh doesn\'t get that daring.' u"Wouldn't by this again.  Spicy curry ramen with chicken.  Not something I'll get again because it has coconut and it's over powering. Then spicy wasn't that spicy which was bearable. But other then that it's fine." u"The service was amazing here -- super friendly polite attentive and focused servers. Maybe it was because of the time? We ate well before the dinner crowd so there weren't a lot of diners. \n\nAll the waiters were constantly glancing around making eye contact looking at our tables to see if we needed anything. They always seemed to know when we were done eating. I knocked one of my chopsticks onto the floor and instantly a different waiter popped by with a new pair. I did not even have the chance to ask for a new one because me and my friend were busy laughing about it! The guy bringing out our food from the kitchen was extremely courteous too. As he dropped off my friend's Bento box he had two bowls of dipping sauces and even took the time to explain which one would go with what food. The same guy would come and take our dishes away and he always double checked we were done with our food was never hasty or assuming. \n\nIt's a small space with tables very close to one another but very clean and cozy. Have additional seats by the sushi making bar. \n\nBathrooms were separate individual rooms for men and women. Women's room was large fairly clean and had sufficient toilet paper soap paper towels.\n\nThe food itself was a bit on the mediocre side: Would have liked to try more hot appetizers but we were on limited time and didn't want to order too much. \n\nTonkatsu ramen -- very small thin slices of pork belly. A salty broth but didn't have any depth or richness of flavor. And the color reminded me of a basic chicken stock from a can/carton. \n\nBuns -- Asian sweet buns with choice of protein. Garnished with pickled cabbage cilantro and homemade peanut powder. We got all the protein: BBQ ribeye braised pork belly or spicy pork.\n\nThese were very good but for the most part all tasted the same because there was nothing very distinguishable about the proteins. Maybe if they did different garnishes with each protein or cut the protein differently (chunks shredded thick slice as opposed to all of them being shredded) they could highlight the different methods of cooking/seasoning. \n\nNot a bad dining experience but the food was not enticing enough to come back and try more." u"I had a reservation for 2 at 7PM on a Tuesday night. The place was surprisingly pretty filled with people too. I wasn't expecting it. They seemed fusion Japanese and Korean food. \n\nWe got the bulgogi don which IS A HUGE. BOWL. BY THE WAY. HUGE. size of your head HUGE. And then the brown belly bowl. Which was like....... size of your fist small.......... that was rly confusing. Maybe we didn't look at the menu right. Even though both bowls were in the same area of the menu. Also split a salmon roll which was yummy. \n\nOverall experience. Decently priced fusion Asian food with good service. No real complaints yay!"],-0.636,0.0,0.278,0.722
174.Judge Roy Bean Public House,[u"Stopped in to escape the heat. Didn't really try the food other than the Cajun Fries which were delish!! Easily could split a portion with someone if not super hungry but needed to fill a small void and want to soak up some good beer.\n\nFries were not big and fat but more kind of small lots of crisps and really tasty! If you like spice they have some good flavour and are a bit salty already. Again we had the Cajun ones.\n\nService was great. Sat at the bar. Good selection of ales.\n\nHandy to those shopping or guys... while your wives are shopping... this is a great man bench! Haha!" u"Terrible. Even for a midtown burger place this sets a new low. My chicken parm tasted like the cheese had turned. My friend had a grilled cheese sandwich that was grilled on only one side; the other side was cold soft bread. At least the members of our party that ordered burgers medium-rare got what they wanted...for half the burger. One side was cooked properly and the other side was a blackened hockey puck.\n\nWant more reasons not to go? The beers are much smaller than a pint. I'm not referring to the eight-ounce beers that come with the special; that's just a case of you-get-what-you-pay for. I'm talking about the $9 beers that pretend to be in a full-sized glass but are at least 2-4 ounces short. It was almost comical given that the tiny beers were sitting next to full-pint water glasses.\n\nThe service was not as terrible as it could have been (hence the extra star) but it was still not great. Getting extra napkins was a bit of a pain (we were originally given three napkins for five people) not really that big of a deal. What was annoying is that when the server cleared the plates of the people who were no longer eating she also took the plate of the one person who was actually enjoying their meal. He was literally picking up a french fry when the server grabbed his plate from underneath his hand (after telling her he was still working on it).\n\nDon't go here." u'Place is really just so so.  Beer is good! But food is not so much.  \n\nI do not know how hey got 4.5 stars on yelp that is usually reserved for a pretty special place and this is not' u"Found this place because we needed a place for lunch that would have Saints football. The food was outstanding! I got the Cilantro Chicken wrap and it was awesome--actually had a little kick to it. My husband got a steak sandwich and he said it was delicious. The fries are handcut and so yummy! They had a more than sufficient craft and local beer selection. The bartender and other waitstaff looked like they did not want to be there and were barely even cordial which is the only reason I subtracted a star. Highly recommend if you're looking for yummy food a great beer selection and a place to watch sports." u"** for the noise the draft from the sloooow-closing door the mediocre food (greasy sloppy joes) the unnecessary music and the oddly placed TVs at an angle that's painful to look at.\nExtra * for awesome server who was on top of her game and for the curve of being slightly less terrible than other midtown spots. Though still way too loud." u'Great selection of beer and service is always amazing! I would recommend this place if you like good beer and awesome atmosphere!' u"Stopped in yesterday for a drink or two but unfortunately the glycol system was down and absolutely everything on tap was not working. Total bummer b/c they had some cool beers I wanted to check in. Oh well\n\nDude got a turkey burger and fries and I had purple haze and Wild Blue beers. The wild blue was friggin amazing and at 8% two got me buzzed. I see they do a $10 lunch special which includes a beer and what is this i see?!- -- write a review/check in AND get a free shot?! I AM ABOUT THAT LIFE. Of course we missed lunch though and I didn't see the free shot mentioning until just now haha so I will DEFO need to venture back here.\n\nTiny location cool ppl at the bar and behind it. Clean af bathrooms. It's a solid." u'Looking to chill and relax.   "old school - irish" vibe Great staff.  Very good service.   Drinks outstanding.   Price OK.   Its NY for gods sake.' u"Awesome! This place is a small little New York style bar with intimate setting they even have Michter's Bourbon! Wish there were more speakeasy places like this in Vegas!" u'Real typical American bar a bit small no great for big groups but the food is immense (forgetting the calories part) mac and cheese and quesadilla were delish... the cocktails were practically all alcohol' u'Came here for a latish lunch on a Sunday. The place was nearly empty and we were seated at a table in the back past the bar. I had the A.B. L. T.  with 7 grain avocado smoked applewood bacon lettuce tomato + hand cut fries. I found the food to be great the beer selection pretty good and the service quick and attentive. Someone else at the table ordered a burger and gave it rave reviews as well.' u'! Tourist review ahead !\nAfter a few days in New York I had grown tired of paying $10+ for my drinks and just wanted something casual and inexpensive. This was the perfect place for us. The mac and cheese was delish and the bartender was super helpful and guided us to some good pizza places so we could have a real "NY Pizza experience"' u"Nice interior. Nice lighting. Air conditioning \n\nI had the Bronx Ale and it was pretty good considering I dislike beer in general.\n\nGood place to come after a walk in Central Park and chat with your crew.\n\nThey also have finger food that looks good but I'll try that next time." u"Tucked into this place on a cold day in search of a  good burger and that's exactly what we found. Burger was perfect (THE BUN!! THE FRIES!)and the Brussel spouts were cooked to perfection. All accompanied by fun & lively conversation with the owner Derek who was behind the bar. Will be back for sure." u"Cozy and quaint. Stopped by after dinner so didn't try the food but they have a good selection of beer." u"Food: 3.0/5.0\nService: 3.5/5.0\nValue: 3.0/5.0\nDecor: 3.0/5.0\nOverall: 3.0/5.0 \n\nDecent pub in midtown.  Not very busy which could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for.  Surprisingly decent bar food." u"Truly this is a three-star spot. The lunch deal is pretty great for NYC: fries a burger and a beer for a tenner. Although we both ordered medium burgers my partner's was well done and mine was medium rare. The fries were good if unmemorable. \n\nWhat pushed it over the edge to four stars for me was the fact that our food was so cheap and we were able to check in on yelp and get two free shots of Crown. Two burgers two beers two shots and fries for $20 in Manhattan? Sure sign me up." u"A surprisingly good Irish bar on one of the least interesting stretches of Midtown West. I've been here before for drinks after work and been impressed by their range of ale/beers and cocktails. Tonight I came with my wife to try their veggie burgers--which were highly recommended by my friend whose last name is Kelly. I walked to the end of the bar and said Kelly sent me. Of course I gave her full Name--very Irish. I ordered a Blueberry Margarita my wife a Belgian ale. There's more than Guinness  on tap. So it's more eclectic than a typical Irish bar. I asked for my burger on a wrap instead of brioche. Not a problem. Substituting some guacamole for fries not a problem. The burger was mushroom-based and house made not a commercial patty. Delicious. Miss Kelly didn't steer us wrong. My wife and I agreed we'll be back soon and often. Service is efficient but servers could smile more. I guess it's Irish stoicism. Substantial provisions." u"Skinny: the skinny on this place is that it serves amazing burgers and has a killer $10 burger and beer deal for lunch\n\nLocation: located in the heart of midtown this burger spot is close to many who work in the area. The restaurant is rather narrow than most but it's likely a product of the density of restaurants in the area. The place is close to the 57th stop on the F line. \n\nMenu/Food: I ordered take out from this place and got their veggie burger with fries option. The burger comes with chipotle sauce and brioche buns. When I took my first bite I thought they mistakenly gave me a beef patty instead of the veggie patty I ordered. However upon taking a bite I could taste the delicate nature of the patty as it was a mixture of black beans corn and other vegetables. It tasted amazing! The fries were also just as good. They packed my food with ketchup packets and utensils which is a plus because many other restaurants in the area do not do so. \n\nVibe: when I went in to pick up my food I was expecting a restaurant full of midtown folks eating lunch. I walked in on the complete opposite as I recall seeing maybe 2-3 other people. The restaurant has a Texas vide to it and probably gets more fun in the evening since they have happy hour specials. I'd recommend the $10 burger beer special." u'Great creamies Great creamies Great creamies Great creamies Great creamies. Great creamies Great creamies Great creamies'],0.9231,0.804,0.196,0.0
33.by CHLOE. Rockefeller Center,[u'I honestly have been a fan of by chloe for so long and I couldn\'t wait for it to be opened! This is close by my workplace so I had to try this location out. \n\nThis by chloe is the biggest one I had been to. There are plenty of seats and free wifi. \n\nTheir food is awesome but a little pricier since it is in the middle of manhattan and that is understandable.\nI always get their sweet potato french fries and their quinoa taco salad. The service is fast and the food never disappoints. \nAs for their burgers I didn\'t really like the Guac Burger. I tried "The Guac Burger" and it was just mediocre. I didn\'t see what the hype was all about. \nI also tried the "Whiskey BBQ" burger and its a must get. I highly recommend it. \n\nOverall service is fast and they don\'t rush you like other fast food places. I highly recommend this place if you feel like you want to eat healthy.~' u"I've always been a big fan of By Chloe but I think they need to focus on quality control. Not only is this place always swamped the food has been hit or miss. When it's good it's great but when your guacamole burger is soggy it's pretty mis. Sometimes their giant cookies are soft and chewy other times hard and inedible. It's a gamble for sure. \n\nI will say that the order online option is great and was ready in less than 30 minutes." u"I usually pass by Chloe in Flatiron. But there's a new location in Rockefeller. Entrance is on 48th st. \n\nAddress was 1 Rockefeller Plaza but the entrance is on 48th St. Ditch the traffic of tourists and enter through the other side. \n\nPlace was packed around 1:30 pm. But line seemed to go by quick. Ordered the classic burger Mac and cheese and guac burger.\n\nAll I can say for some place that is vegan and serves burgers I had low expectations. BUT this devilry hits the spot. You do get full with a burger but not like greasy nasty food coma. \n\nDefinitely a must stop for not so quick lunch in midtown. Cause it's packed with tourists. Maybe I'll try the other locations." u"The latest in the rapidly growing by CHLOE. empire just opened in Rockefeller Center a perfect location to draw in lots of tourists especially during holiday season.\n\nIt's a huge location like the Williamsburg one with all the same great stuff plus all of the off-menu stuff from all of the locations including the Oh So Fancy Fries and the BLT. New to this location to are two new smoothies the Black & the White which will be available for a limited time (go with the white over the black as the black has that grainy charcoal consistency which is not as smooth as the other one).\n\nThis is one of the better choices now around the tourist-heavy area that has mostly lower quality fast casual and chain options." u"I'm so happy this location is finally open. Took about 20 minutes for me to order and get my food - not bad for the first day.\n\nI could literally eat the quinoa taco salad every day and the chocolate chip cookie is so good.\n\nHopefully online ordering is available soon! Midtown lunch will never be the same!" u'This place is FANTASTIC! Even if your not vegan you will love it. The food taste fresh and is full of flavor. 5 stars for sure!!! The taco salad is  yummmm.' u'I really had high hopes coming here. It was very under whelming. Everything taste just meh. \n\nOk burger soggy fries cloying pasta. \n\nIt is fast food but just not done well!' u"So happy to see a new large location open up by my job. Lots of customers ordered in advance online and definitely mostly take-out. Lots of seating available though for those who choose to dine in. Signature quinoa taco salad pesto meatball sandwich and whiskey BBQ burger taste great as usual. Plus same baked goodies including the chocolate chip cookies and love the cupcakes. Seasonal flavor for the fall is s'mores. You don't have to be vegan to appreciate the food and desserts here - non-vegans enjoy it too!" u"This is my favorite place  Best Vegan food on the planet ! Mac and cheese please ! Cinnamon Lemonade  Guacamole burgers  fries  hostess cupcakes yum is all I can say no guilt ! I love this new location it's beautiful and huge lots of room to sit. I went here Saturday for brunch and it was amazing the menu. Pancakes tofu scramble sausage mixed greens. The staff is nice and friendly." u"So happy that by Chloe is now open here~ the space is big lots of places to sit. There was a huge line during lunch but it went by fairly quickly.\n\nI ordered their guac burger my friend had the classic burger and we shared the Mac & cheese! They were all so yummy!\n\nCan't wait to go back to try their other items on the menu." u"It's a nice space with plenty of tables available. I had a guacamole burger and it was delicious. It's a bit on a small side but it's good for you!! They text you when your order is ready. It's a nice feature because you don't have to stand by the counter and wait. It gets very busy during lunch." u"Took 25 minutes and the line wasn't even that long. In the end they got my order wrong. I ended up getting the taco salad for $13 which tasted ok - the taste did not live up to the hype. Disappointing to say the least. $13 is not worth an ok lunch meal that could have been self made at Whole Foods." u'Fabulous vegan and kosher certified restaurant. The salad and all its ingredients were extremely fresh and crisp. The sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection. For the $ the portion size is just excellent and it is very filling. The staff members working at this by CHOLE. location were friendly and helpful. I really recommend this place when you are in the need for a delicious and healthy option.' u"That was a pleasant surprise. I had the (veg) Italian Meatball and I have to say that really hit the spot. The use of shiitake mushrooms to impart the meaty flavor was really smart and normally I am not a big fan of vegetarian foods trying to masquerade as meat dishes. Portions are kind of small for the price but it's Manhattan. And the place gets quite the line. I'll be ordering online as soon as they have that working." u"BYE Chloe! Overpriced and underwhelming.I'm literally eating a $13 salad that has iceberg lettuce. Are you kidding me? I also waited like 15 minutes for it. Ain't nobody got time for that! Save your lunch money and go to thousand other places at Rock Center where you can get real food for half the price." u"Their food is fabulous!!!  The roasted garlic cauliflower cashew soup is one of my favorites. Everything is delicious!!!  So happy it's close to work!!!"],0.7067,0.493,0.507,0.0
124.Hama Japanese Cuisine,[u"Hopping for lunch time.  The best option is the Chirakashi bowl for lunch time at $20.  Fresh sashimi's on top of rice.  Wish the rice is a little warmer but the presentation inside a bento box is a nice touch.\n\nDrawback is that they don't take reservation for two.  Turnover is fast though since people come during their lunch hour.  It does get a little loud.  Service is fast but hard to get their attention.  We didn't have chopsticks and I had to get them myself since my rice was getting cold while waiting.\n\nFor the price and quality of fish I would come back.  Just perhaps not refined enough if you're thinking about a business lunch. Sushi yashuda is only a few blocks away if you're lucky enough to snag a reservation." u"Very authentic Japanese-style sashimi with impeccable presentation. \n\nI stopped in for a quick lunch prior to hitting 5th and was quickly seated at the sushi bar. I managed to get in while no one was there but within 20 minutes there wasn't a table to be found which I took a good sign.\n\nI opted for the sashimi lunch which came with soup or salad (I took the soup). The miso was the lighter style and made for a tasty broth.\n\nMy sashimi was amazing as each style of fish came with its own unique topping. I particularly liked the red pepper paste on the salmon which gave it a spicy twist and the lightly smoked dressing on the real (not imitation) crab sticks. \n\nThe dish while pricey also came with toro hamachi snapper regular tuna black snapper and butter fish. It was large enough that I didn't feel full as I contemplated ordering some uni or a roll prior to getting the dish but they were not needed.\n\nService was a little disjointed as I had three people wait on me and it took some time to get the check." u"Food safety alert on sashimi!\nWe ordered chef specials for two on a Friday night. I got nauseated when the second piece of salmon sashimi hit me... Andrew has a way tougher stomach than me and he didn't feel nauseated until he had all his portion before the red tuna. That one was really really bad...\nOn the bright side they have great drink menu! I like the sake cocktail." u"Great happy hour special! $5 sake hot or cold and a nice selection of drinks appetizers sushi and other items to share!!\n\nI love how this location is downstairs it's very clean and has a great atmosphere. Great place to hangout with friends without the noise level being insane. \n\nWhat we ordered\nCrab bun\nTakoyaki\nShrimp shui mai\nPork shui mai\nPork bun\nSquid\nTwo other rolls\n\nEverything was light and filling. I would definitely come back again. Also service was very attentive and friendly !  I would definitely come back another time!" u"I was craving sushi and we were in midtown so we looked for an affordable restaurant and as you may expect that was pretty difficult. \n\nThe restaurant is tucked away underground from the commotion of Rockefeller center dimly lit and beautiful place settings. I instantly felt relaxed upon sitting down. \n\nWe ordered rolls and the sushi set and everyone had the same opinion solid if you're craving it but not excellent. The rolls are a little smaller than I'm used to but I guess it's to be expected considering the location. I would come again if I was craving sushi and in the area but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way." u"I would give 3.5 if that's an option.\n\nWe came in around 8:20 for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. We ordered omakase but they didn't come in pieces and we had to wait till all of them are ready coming in on a huge plate at once. \n\nThe fish was fresh but the rice was too sticky and not seasoned well. I personally prefer very traditional sushi which usually doesn't have additional toppings like jalape\xf1os or fried garlic if you know what I'm saying. \n\nIt is very good value with more than 11 or more nigiris and a hand roll for $50. But because I prefer traditional sushi and I know a few that fall within that price arrange I probably won't be coming back" u'Happy hour 5-7 PM at designated seating area. However we arrived ~6:25 PM and the staff just assumed and led us to the non-happy hour area. \n\nSome starters/small plates were alright but the rolls are really not great. Their wasabi has no taste.' u"Great happy hour menu. \n\nThe yellowtail was a real standout. Such an amazing roll for $9. Crunch salmon was yummy. Good sushi good price.  Great shumais and gyozas.\n\nModern looking interior. Service was a bit poor. Our waitress was polite but was clueless on a lot of things and was either unable to answer our questions or providing us with inaccurate info. \n\nThe grilled octopus was good but didn't really wow me. \n\nNot a big fan of the sake sangria. I wish I had gotten the lychee cocktail instead." u'For NYC this is great quality sushi for an amazingly low price. The dining area is very large with plenty of space for larger parties. Wait staff is fast and courteous but also not to aggressive.' u"Good teriyaki salmon. \nGood rolls. (Spicy tuna salmon avocado)\n\nGood ambience\n\nI'd go back" u"I have been here twice for dinner and my experience here wasn't bad. The place wasn't crowded or super busy when we came and we were seated immediately both times. \n\nOverall the prices are slightly more expensive from the Japanese restaurants that I usually go too. The sushi rolls were tasty and the udon was good too. I thought it took them awhile to bring out the sushi rolls during my 1st time here tho. I like the ambience here and the place wasn't noisy at all. It's a clean and modern looking restaurant too. Great for groups or date night." u"Surprised such an affordable and pretty sushi restaurant exists in Rockefeller Center. We had made a res for a Wednesday night dinner but didn't need one. It's downstairs so you won't have cell phone reception. Good focus on your date! I ordered the salmon lovers roll which is made up of grilled salmon salmon salmon roe asparagus & cucumber. So you can safely assume I like salmon if I'm ordering that! Well they made it quickly and it came out very fresh. It filled me up and I enjoyed each piece. Also tried some sashimi and the crab sticks and liked it all. \n\nAs for ambiance it's a great place for dates but also for going with your family. It's nice and cute and service was efficient too. Was weird that they randomly brought out our check before asked for it but other than that all was fine. If you're in midtown and craving some Japanese foodstuffs hit up Hama." u'The determining factor for any good sushi place ultimately comes down to how fresh the fish was. It was very fresh...\n\nThe overall experience was great and the interior design of the place gave it an elegant touch. More reasonably prices than a lot of the other places nearby and giving full reigns to the chef by ordering the omakaze was indeed a fantastic experience.\n\nThe flavors combinations that the chef used for the topping of each piece was a delight and I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking to great sushi.\n\nMy only gripe was the appetizers we got. While they were ok it was really nothing to write home about. But this is a very small issue that was instantly resolved once the main course came along.\n\nService was great and responsive and our waitress was very helpful to ensure we had the best possible experience.' u"I really recommend this sushi spot! Hama is an authentic Japanese restaurant but also has a trendy modern feel. Also it's very clean which makes me feel good when eating at any sushi spot. All of the food I ordered was yummy and super fresh! Probably some of the freshest sushi I've had in NYC. \n\nI ordered the house salad with ginger dressing ($6) shrimp shumai ($7.50) and a Philadelphia roll ($8.50). Everything was delicious! The shrimp shumai was some of the best I've ever eaten; loaded with big fresh shrimp. I also enjoyed that my sushi roll was rolled in soy paper; definitely a plus. \n\nMy friend ordered bento box A ($21): shrimp tempura gyoza edamame chicken teriyaki and a California roll. My friend loved her meal and it was such a great deal! \n\nAll in all a great fresh Japanese dinner for a great price (about $27 each with tax and tip!). I definitely would return." u'Okay place.\n\nFresh sushi tho.' u"I like the spot-good ambience and service. I recommend it to my coworkers since it's decent and in the area. I came here twice for dinner here is what I think-\nIm between and 3 and 4 stars-\nSushiwise not worth the cost their hot dishes look so much better with a better dollar value.Looks like they have a good lunch deal but I haven't tried it yet sashimi and sushi extremely small and not filling fish is not the best quality..  seems the place is still working on themselves so will give it another chance:)" u"Three stars because of the service. \n\nFood: came here for HH. Wine was affordable. Ordered Alaska Roll salmon sushi tuna and uni (sea urchin) sushi (I'm a sucker of sea urchin). While the roll was okay delicious sea urchin was fishy and same was tuna. I guess I shouldn't have had ordered uni here anyways. Overall I don't hate the food but it's definitely not the best I have had for that price. \n\nService: the hostess was very nice. However our waitress kind of ruined the whole HH experience. after we cleaned our plates she came over and took the plates and asked if we wanted more food. We said no. We were chatting over our half full glass of wines. After 10 minutes or so she came over with the bill we didn't ask for it. Our wine glasses were still kind of full. I felt like she was kicking us our passive aggressively. Had she asked nicely I would have been okay with paying. \n\n After we paid the bill with credit cards waitress messed up our cards with others TWICE. She handed our card to other tables and gave other people's cards to us. I know it's not the biggest deal and she was probably green so I probably should be open minded but that was just not professional. Didn't apologize either. \n\nNot coming back." u"We were looking for sushi before going to a show and my daughter in law found Hama. You walk down into the basement but you'll immediately feel the warm and upscale vibe when you open the door. We had no reservation and thankfully arrived before the crowd. \n\nWe were thrilled to learn they had happy hour specials on drinks and sushi nice score! Everyone put in drink orders and then began looking over the HH sushi menu. We started with some appetizers steamed dumplings edamame and seaweed salad. The we went crazy on sushi rolls. Everyone found something they like and everything was so fresh and amazing.\n\nThe service was pretty good despite a couple of misfires on ordering additional rolls but no biggie. The kiddos finished everything off with fried ice cream which I wasn't crazy about. \n\nDefinitely if you're near Rockefeller check this place out. Food was superb service was top notch atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for date night!" u"Ok. I get that this is a popular lunch crowd but I don't get all the 4-5 star reviews for this place. It is IN NO WAY 4 STARS! I was misled by the other reviews to give this place a shot and now I'm pissed that I wasted my quota there!\n\nTo start off my friend and I showed up at 12:45 for a table. I get that it was busy because it was right smack in the middle of lunch time for the midtown crowd. When we got there there was one large party waiting for a table and another party of 2 waiting for a table. We put our name down. What totally ticked me off is that there were other folks who came in after us (also parties of 2) and they were all getting seated before us. I hate to have say this but they were seating all the non-asians who showed up after us. When I called her out on it and asked her she rolled her eyes at me. \n\nI also suspect that they are not Japanese owners. The staff didn't seem very interested and were not very attentive. \n\nWe ordered 2 unadons and a hot sake to share. They wanted to charge us for tea. A real japanese restaurant does NOT charge for green tea! What nerve! \n\nWhen the unadon came out the rice was hard. Seemed like the rice was sitting there for awhile and dried out and they just stuck it in the microwave. The unagi was super fatty. Probably they used the unagi from China. In any event quality was subpar. For the price they charged take-sushi on 48th street would have been better. While the decor is more fancy here compared to take-sushi I didn't think the quality of the food was that great. \n\nI've been to enough sushi restaurants from low end to high end and the quality of the food here was a 2/10 and that's being generous. Service was a 2/10 as well. Restaurants like these can do well if they just treat their customers right! Don't nickel and dime with the green tea! And don't ever make it so blatantly obvious that you're giving people's tables away. It will not go unnoticed! You will be called out! And it won't be pretty for you when you do!" u"They have the freshest sushi I've ever had in a while. Ordered the veggie roll and the California rolls and I'd say it was truly delectable. Food was presented in an artful way which made the whole experience here really great. The service here was great as well. I had an amazing experience here and will be back here again."],0.5859,0.275,0.725,0.0
176.Pulperia Hell’s Kitchen,[u'Great food great staff great show. Who could ask for more?\n\nBeen here twice for the Sunday "Drag Brunch." What an amazing way to spend two hours. The staff is helpful courteous and keeps the free drink refills coming. The food was amazing which was surprising since the place was packed and the entire restaurant had to be turned in under 2 hours. I had the tostados really great flavor. Bloody Mary\'s were spicy but not too spicy and had very good flavors.\n\nThe show was great. Three drag queens interacted with us in between songs/routines. Their dancing was phenomenal. It is truly a great show. Be sure to bring small bills to tip them throughout the event. We did because they deserved it. Definitely will be back again.' u"An out of town friend and business associate met here for dinner and I tagged along. \n\nI feel like I live on the block: Joe Allen Don't Tell Mama etc. \n\nAnd I had no idea this was here: so many places and I tend to go to the same ones. \n\nThe ceilings are unusually low so if you're a claustrophobe (I'm not) this would not be the ideal spot on restaurant row. \n\nI had only the ceviche which was quite good. My martinis were excellent and generous. \n\nThe two entrees I saw looked delicious (particularly the mussels with green rice) and I stole a bite or two of mashed potatoes from my friend. (I'd never met the other guy before so did not steal his food: that would be rude). \n\nReasonably-priced entrees." u"I'm not a seafood person but I enjoyed dinner at Pulperia. The service was outstanding for a group of 8 on a late Sunday evening. \n\nStarted out with a variety of delicious cocktails pork and beef empanadas and wonton tacos. The classic pulperia and chilango drinks have tangy and spicy rims that are just lip smacking. I'd have liked to try the crab empanada but at 9pm they were out.\n\nFor my entree I had king crab with melted butter. Our waiter came out with gloves and a scissor and cut up my steaming hot crab legs. Was easy to eat after that! Careful with the butter though - super salty. Loved my side of garlic mashed potatoes with it. \n\nFor dessert we tried both the tres leches cake absolutely delicious and the churros eh just ok." u'Food-4\nService-5\nValue-4\nAmbiance-4\n\nWent here for a celebration and the waiter made sure we had a good time.  The drinks were just amazing! The tamarind cocktail and the pulparia special were off the charts good.\nGuacamole the beef empanadas veg empanadas were delicious. The lobster wonton( was it taco?) had good amount of lobster.\nIn mains we got the black spaghetti( good) lamb meatballs( v good) burrata( the only veg entree) and the seafood stew.\nFish and seafood lovers will have a blast here. However I would appreciate some chicken and vegetarian dishes for  a nice balance.\nThe waiter brought out a chocolate cake and passion fruit  flan on the house- (thank you!) and we ordered the churro. Loved all three!\nGo for appetizers and drinks if you are not big on seafood.' u'Came here on a Mondays for their all night happy hours.  The drinks were great and the tapas was good too.  Great Fort pre and post theater.  Will try their entrees next time. Good place and close to the broadway theaters.' u"3-3.5 stars but rounding down- their appetizers were better than their entrees and service can be slow. Pulperia is a very cozy restaurant that doesn't have a ton of tables but they were able to accommodate a large party of 14 with just a day's notice. Our group probably could have used a little more elbow room but we made it work. We tried:\n\n-El Guacamole ($12): Delicious- one of the best versions of guacamole I've had at a restaurant in a long time. A must try!\n-Taquitos de Langosta (Crispy Wonton Shells Maine Lobster Grilled Pineapple Avocado Cream Spicy Kewpie Mayo $20): Yum- these were tasty little taquitos and a great combination of flavors. Recommended!\n-Ceviche Mixto (Bay Scallops Octopus Squid Cucumber Avocado Cilantro Aji Amarillo Leche de Tigre $16): Just ok- I'm not a big fan of ceviche mixto in general. The seafood tasted fresh but I wouldn't order this again.\n-Escabeche de Pulpo (Octopus Chorizo Colorado Scallions Capers Cilantro Tomatoes Chipotle Hummus $17): Also just ok for me and nothing special.\n-El Salmon Brulee (Salmon Tartar Fromage Brulee Strawberry & Ginger Leche de Tigre $16): The combination of ingredients was definitely unique and I liked this dish even though the brulee top added a good amount of sweetness. I loved their salmon tartar and the overall flavors- recommended!\n-Burrata (Spinach-Jalapeno Pesto Heirloom Tomatoes Roasted Garlic-Saffron Aioli $20 https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EOMMQR75qiMZSmFYPhk9Lw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): YUM- a must try! Their burrata was super fresh and gooey and the pesto was delicious.\n-Pulpo/Octopus ($33): The octopus was overcooked and a little chewy. I thought this dish was just ok and wouldn't order it again.\n-Barbacoa De Pacu (Grilled Brazilian Fish Ribs Orange Chipotle BBQ Sauce $25 https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nAVWbR7A03B-29XynY4wsQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The BBQ sauce was really good but the meat on the fish ribs were a little dry. This dish was a bit too unique for me and I wouldn't get this again.\n-Dessert Plate (w/Churros Chocolate Cake Flan https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FibKfzdKkMLQ95ETR9fXkQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Everything was just ok- the churros were crispy but a little dry. The chocolate cake was moist but nothing special. The flan was served in a large glass which made it difficult to eat and the texture was a bit too thick. I wouldn't get dessert here again.\n\nI tried a bite from a few different sides (Coconut Rice Eggplant Chambota Russian Potato Salad) and all were delicious. My favorites were the coconut rice and eggplant. Although the servers were really nice we had to keep flagging them down to order drinks and it also took them a long time to bring us our drinks. I would recommend coming to Pulperia for drinks and appetizers at the bar and would definitely come back for their guacamole and burrata!" u"really good seafood! Loved the Brazilian seafood stew the seafood in there are very tender and flavourful the portion is just right. Came around 10pm on a Sunday and it's still quite busy" u"Pulperia is a super cute small and garden level restaurant right in the thick of Manhattan. It's romantic and intimate with a bar in front and seating in the back. They have great pescatarian options!\n\nWe had a reservation for 5 people at 7pm and arrived a half hour early to grab a drink at the bar. The music was very loud and difficult to hear conversation among our group. We ended up having to wait an hour until 8pm for our table because the group before us took much longer than expected. They kindly served us champagne on the house while we had to wait. They should consider a new method for calculating wait times especially when we had a reservation.\n\nThe food was really good! Will definitely be back but perhaps with a smaller group. The crowd cleared out at one point probably due to the timing of Broadway shows that night." u"Great balanced pisco and egg white drinks not unlike pisco sours but a tad more complex.  The grilled octopus was really very tender among the best I've had and came with a selection of different marinated vegetables.  The tagliatelle pasta was quite good and nicely stewed.  Clearly some care went into preparing and simmering the sauce.  The lobster taquitos were a nice but not particularly memorable start to the meal.  \n\nI'd definitely considering returning though walking across Times Square to get here was pretty tragic as it always is." u"Very good after work and group gathering place for happy hour. Great friendly friendly staffs. Came here for a birthday celebration for my mate and her buddies.\n\n The appetizers were good. \n\nThe guacamole was good plenty of flavor. We have to ask for more tortilla (too thin for the dip keep breaking to pieces)\n\nThe fish tacos was great! Must order. Enough said. \n\nThe trio tasting plates of tartar and octopus. Was pretty good for opening your taste buds for a big appetite. \n\nThe lamb rack was pretty okay for me but the lamb's aroma is so strong to the point some buds can't take it. Pretty juicy and good if you like lambs with strong aroma. \n\nThe steak was pretty decent. It was medium and was not dried out. Could use a bit more flavoring. \n\nThe whole bronzino was pretty good in flavoring. The skin was kind of dry but sealed in the juicy meat. \n\nThe main attraction was suppose to be the fish ribs... but it was two miss and one hit (we ordered three plates). The first two plates were dry!! The skin was dried to be chewy. Seems like it was been sitting under the seat for too long. The last plate came looks totally different the fish ribs were moist and juicy. Guess that's why it came out a bit later...freshly made? \n\nOverall is not a bad place for a happy hour hang out... will be back if in the neighborhood." u"Great place for happy hour! I've been struggling to find a good happy hour menu with food but this place is perfect.\n\nOn their HH food menu they have:\n-$1 oysters\n-$7 guac\n-$6 for 3 taquitos\n-$7 empanadas (a variety of meats to choose from)\n\nThey have 5-6 kinds of wines (including sangria) for $8-9 and a few cocktails for $9.\n\nWhile the location is a little far west on 9th don't be deterred! This is a great place for post-work drinks. The environment is dark and intimate with a latin-feel.\n\nHappy hour seating is at the bar but there wasn't any room when I got there. The manager was wonderful and seated me at a table instead. He kept checking on us throughout the night to make sure we were okay--very attentive!" u"My girlfriend and I came here right after work to get some food before a show. We picked this place based on the Yelp reviews and the close proximity to the theatre we were definitely not disappointed!\n\nAlthough you can't find the Happy Hour menu online there is one! Definitely check it out when you have time after work. For the HH specials you must sit at the bar. The bartender Alex was amazing! He kept me company while I waited for my friend but knew when to give me space so I can read the menu. He made great recommendations and was willing to make substitions for us.\n \nFor food we ordered the Happy Salmon Taquitos oysters (did I mention $1 oysters for HH??) and the Black Seafood Spaghetti. The taquitos were great loved the grilled pineapple on top gave it a great flavor! It's served in a taco-like form; very unique and tasty. Oysters were super fresh. And the spaghetti dish was amazing. You get to pick the size small or large - same amount of pasta the difference is the amount of seafood. The red sauce it's made with was perfectly flavored; I wiped it clean with the bread. \n\nOverall it was an amazing meal with great company. Shout out to the manager Ricardo for making sure we had a great time. Also we got to meet the owner Victor. He was very open to hearing our feedback on his restaurant and tips on how to improve. Although there is nothing wrong with your restaurant knowing that you're willing to listen makes me want to come back!" u"3.8\n\nI came here for the happy hour deal which goes til 7p but I think that's probably as far as I'll go. They have a pretty eclectic happy hour food menu including dollar oysters discounted ceviche guacamole/chips empanadas and the list goes on. They also have a great drink menu with select delicious cocktails for a fraction of the regular price. \n\nWhile the food and service were great the AC system needed serious work. It was probably 95 degrees out + crazy humid and the resto was kind of warm! We loved the deals but decided we needed to leave bc of the temp in there. Otherwise I really do love the happy hour here!" u'Nice and dark place!\nNeeds candles on the tables to set the "candle light mood"\nBut honestly great food and great service!\nLocated at a great spot!\nThey have a great tequila bar!\nBut wine selection is good too!' u'Amazing. Went with a group of 4 and we split the Crudo Tasting which consists of ceviche mixto escabeche de pulp and salmon br\xfbl\xe9e. I ordered the taquitos de langosta - lobster avocado grilled pineapple and spicy mayo in fried wonton shells. The taquitos (4) are bursting with fresh flavors that blend so well! And the wonton shells were fried perfectly. This is a small dish but was plenty for me after sharing the crudo tasting. Two of my companions ordered the albondigas and said they were superb. Everything was cooked to perfection. My third companion ordered the short ribs and ate every bit of it. She said she\'s never tasted anything like it! We ordered the flan to split and we were also able to try the tres leeches cake. Both exceeded our expectations! The flan is like no other flan I have ever tried! Make sure to save room for it!\n\nNow on to the service. Fan-fucking-tastic! Our waiter made us feel comfortable and made food recommendations and was not offended when we decided to order something else anyway. He was friendly and when I asked for the dessert menu his response was "I am the dessert menu..........meaning I can tell you all that we have to offer for dessert." We all laughed at his wittiness. I\'m a customer service person the service I receive means more to me than the food. This restaurant hit 5 stars on both. \n\nDo not hesitate to try this amazing restaurant! I recommend making reservations. The restaurant is cozy and beautifully decorated. The bar offers wonderful unique tasty drinks. I am so happy to have found this restaurant and will return every time I visit NYC. You will love it here!!!' u"A good restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. A small room close to the theaters. They ask you to order everything you want at the same time because the kitchen is small (not a problem). Each plate was tasty and well balanced. The cocktails were also good. We'll be back." u'I have been here twice and I really want to love this place but the food is just good not stellar. The service both times has been excellent (different servers).  The first time I went there for my girlfriends birthday and they really took care of us. The second time was for a casual date and the service was just was wonderful. They really cared about making our meal absolutely to our liking and did everything possible to make us happy (we made many requests). I absolutely love the ambiance too; the place is so quaint dark sexy and alive.' u'Great for Happy hour with friends!  Read all the reviews on Yelp and photos. The most convenient is reserved via Yelp directly. Had a dinner with a good friend on a weekday around 7PM. Cold and hot dishes were well presented. Both the clerk and price are friendly~ Will definitely go back one day.' u'More like a 3.5.\n\nCame here because friends had a show to catch nearby. The ambience is great the food was pretty good but it was more expensive than I would have liked. I guess it was to be expected considering the location - and it is better than a lot of the restaurants in the area. As long as you go in with the right expectations this place is A-OK.' u"The drag show was awesome but it pretty much ends there. The service here is absolutely terrible. We were seated late and then told after an hour that we were being cut off even though we paid for unlimited. The food took so long to come out and half of the orders were wrong. My friend order a salad and got a bowl of farro. My other friend asked specifically for no beans because she has IBS and was served beans. We tried to be understanding but there were multiple people with dietary restrictions who can't get wrong orders.\n\nSome of the other people in our party got cold food. I ordered the Tortilla Espanola and was unimpressed. In general nobody really enjoyed the food so even if the service was better this place is sub par when it comes to brunch.\n\nThe management was not very helpful when it came to resolving these issues. They gave us a dessert for my friend's birthday and took off one order from our bill even though there were multiple wrong orders and we didn't even get unlimited drinks for the whole time. We are highly dissatisfied with our experience here.\n\nSteer clear of this place. I'm sure there are better drag brunches out there!"],0.5562,0.41,0.448,0.142
19.Taco Dumbo,[u'Really nice place to grab lunch. Had the taco salad with chicken and it was delicious. My friend had the rice bowl and added salmon. She loved hers too. Beautifully plated - you eat with your eyes first they say. Weird I know. Portion was appropriate and we left feeling "nutrified?" and satisfied. \n\nThere was ample seating - from the bar to high top tables to the more standard tables. The staff was lovely and helpful. The patrons next to us were francophone and were served without hesitation in French - a nice touch that you don\'t find often even in our crazy diverse city. \n\nOn another note... Do I like nori? I\'m not sure. But I\'ll be back to try their nori rolls and the guac.' u"So happy to have this little gem a few doors down from my office. Finally a place in midtown where you can sit down for a nice meal without having to use a corporate card!\n\nI happen to be someone who tries to stay on a low-cal diet...this makes eating out challenging. The staff here couldn't be more helpful. The menu is great on its own if you are trying to stay healthy as they offer many lettuce wrap options making the meals a lot more figure friendly. However if you want to substitute ingredients they are super accommodating. \n\nToday I had the rice bowl with Chilean sea bass (perfectly cooked and super flavorful they marinade it overnight!) Since I didn't want the rice they substituted cauliflower rice so good! You don't miss the rice at all and you get to eat quilt free! Last week I tried the nori tacos with cauliflower rice as well (instead of brown rice). Wish more restaurants had these options!\n\nAdditionally they have a full bar wish fresh juice margs! \n\nMy colleague also has severe food allergies the manager was nice enough to walk her through every option! \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood Taco Dumbo!" u"This is a jewel in midtown. And there are probably other locations as well. The food is fresh and spectacular the bar is great and the staff is charming. It's casual but very cool and you can order ahead time with their app or have it delivered. We have never had a bad meal here." u"The food is great the staff is friendly and the ambiance is nice! It's the perfect place for lunch dinner or after work drinks with friends/ coworkers. This location opened a few days ago and I think they're off to a great start. I'll definitely be returning!" u'Cool place. Food was good and staff was friendly. Alcohol was good and food came fast.' u"Foods not bad but portions are tiny. I'm starving an hour later. Not worth it for a 16 buck lunch." u"tacos were decent guacamole was ok however the avocados were not fully ripe for the price they should have been perfect.   I tried a couple different vegan tacos. that being said I've never felt so ripped off. I had to go somewhere else after for food because I was still hungry extremely small portions. I never complain about the cost of food but this place was a ripoff." u"Had a great experience at other Taco Dumbo locations so when I heard they opened another one near my meetings today I suggested it for lunch. I was so glad I did-the space is so fun and unique and the staff's energy reflects the happy but relaxed decor. The tortilla soup was fantastic! So flavorful and I love that it had organic blue corn chips because they seemed to hold up better than others. I also had the vegan fall squash salad which was as fresh filling and flavorful as everything I've ever had at the other locations. My colleagues went crazy over the butternut squash soup. Def rec checking it out." u'I really wanted to like this place.  Quick friendly service varied menu decent prices.  But the nori tacos I had had a horrifically bad flavor - not spoiled but flavorless for fish with an odd metallic/industrial aftertaste.  Unfortunately the worst lunch of the year.' u'The food is delicious the service was great and the place is adorable. What else could you want? I had the squash soup (so good) and the cauliflower rice bowl and loved both of them. As someone who is a vegetarian and gluten free this place was a godsend. I went with someone who eats meat and wheat and she loved it too. Will be back! (next time for margs) :)'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
73.Toasties,[u"I've never had a bialys bagel before I love it! This is a small cafe great for people watching in the mornings when workers from all over come in and grab food. I love how the store employees seem to recognize most of their customers :)\n\nWarm roasted bagel with cream cheese and smooth coffee--what more could you want!" u'I never knew this place existed until they showed up on my mealpal listing.\nTheir mealpal offerings have been EXCELLENT.  Not only big portions but very tasty!  \nThis was validated when I visited their location several times for a mealpal pick up - initially I thought that was the mealpal line but NOPE those were their regular customers.  It was crazy the place was packed with people waiting for their orders.   This is definitely a hidden gem (well not anymore after this review posts...hehe.)' u"Was visiting from Los Angeles California for a music festival and spent 4 days in New York City so of course I was trying my best to eat like a local and try a new spot every day. I came here with a group of friends whom enjoyed their meals as well but this is my review not theirs ;)\nI had the western omelette for my meal which came with some potatoes as well with an orange juice on the side. The orange juice is all natural straight from the fruit and you can taste the difference in quality due to this. Considering my meal was $6 and in the city I figured it would be small or lacking flavor. Not only was my meal delicious it was actually filling! I would definitely recommend this place :)\nThe pricing on the other items isn't too expensive either and the wait for the 3 meals we ordered was no more than 5-10 minutes so we were in and out quickly." u"I think I have found my sandwich soulmate here at Toasties. \n\nI came here for a quick lunch in the Midtown area. Food came out within 5-10 minutes of ordering which is amazing considering the amount of people that were in the shop. \n\nThe Popeye sandwich is in my eyes the perfect chicken sandwich. Picture this: thinly pounded chargrilled chicken topped with fresh red cabbage earthy alfalfa sprouts romaine tossed in sweet honey mustard and melted mozzarella. Smack that goodness in between two perfectly toasted slices of whole wheat bread and there you have it- a balanced blend of savory sweet crunchy and chewy to brighten up the rest of your day. \n\nI am thoroughly impressed at the quality of the sandwich considering the traffic and short wait time. Can't wait to try the other sandwiches at this spot! Would recommend getting here a little earlier for breakfast and lunch as the place is pretty busy." u"(May 2016) This review is long overdue but I miss New York City so much and as I was going through my pictures I couldn't help to notice that I didn't leave this cute little place a review (so here I am 8 months later lol).\n\nThis is such a good place to grab breakfast goodies. FYI Do not let the line push you away (it goes super fast I promise). My bf and I Came here on a busy Friday morning to catch a quick bite before our  flight to Canada. We yelped a few places but this spot caught our attention I mean come on 'Toasties' for a breakfast/sandwich place (it sounds so yummy and warm).\n\nPopeyes sandwich:\nMy bf ordered this and seriously I wish I ordered the same sandwich. It had Grilled chicken breast with melted mozzarella cheese (should I go on...) lol with spinach alfalfa sprouts roasted red peppers shredded red cabbage romaine lettuce and honey mustard to bind the sandwich altogether. It sounds like a lot but it was delicious! All of the flavors combined to perfection at every bite. At first though my bf and I looked at each other about the red cabbage but it was not bad at all if anything it gave that extra crunch to the sandwich and it worked. Must try!!!! You won't regret it I promise lol.\n\nBreakfast Sandwich:\nAfter drinking and partying too hard the night before I wanted to grab an ultimate breakfast sandwich lol. I ordered an everything bagel with bacon egg cream cheese and cheese. Nothing special about the sandwich it tasted like a bagel sandwich with exactly what I ordered. The egg was too over cooked for my liking but the bacon made up for it I guess. The grease and the melted cheese (oh man it was delicious). The minus star is for not having cream cheese in my bagel (I specifically ordered it with regular cream cheese inside) but there was none. When I went up to the counter to tell them they said cream cheese was extra and I honestly didn't mind paying for it cause I ordered it to begin with.. but they were super nice about it and they just gave it to me for free. \n\nI highly recommend this place (they have several locations) so check them out!! I will definitely come back for more (this time Popeyes sandwich I'm coming for you) lol." u'Very disappointed to see the hours to be till 5pm and the store is already closed at 4:28 pm.' u'When I first started my new job in the city one of the first things my new co-worker told me was "go to Toasties - their sandwiches are the bomb.com". Though I may be editorializing a bit on the latter part of that statement it was heavily implied and well deserved. Though it may look and feel like any of the normal cookie cutter deli\'s that populate midtown West I have not yet found another deli that manages to make such a delicious chicken parmesan sandwich (an attribute I later discovered was due to the butter they covered the chicken with before parmigianing it). The tomato sauce was not just a normal parmesan topping but had a unique taste to it sweet and savory all at the same time. \n\nThough lines can be long particularly during the office lunch rush of 12 to 1 and the prices towards the upper end of moderate the orders move quickly and the portions are generous.' u"I have only been here for breakfast so my review will be based solely on that.\nAnytime I am here in the mornings there's a long line. Luckily it moves quickly. Most customers are people who work in the area. They have a large selection of breakfast items including eggs made to order breakfast sandwiches and wraps baked goods yogurt and fruit salads. \nEverything is always made perfectly and comes out nice and hot. Their ordering systems is very organized. You order in the back pay in the front then step to the side and wait for your ticket number  to be called. Prices are very reasonable for Times Square." u'The Quick: Your one stop shop for bacon egg and cheese or whatever your hungover Friday breakfast of choice is. \n\nThe Details: Toasties is perfect for to go options on a work day. Many of  sandwiches include avocado and are not widely overpriced. Great for a midtown BEC. \n\nThe Damage: $5-$6 for BEC with extra goodie (AVO egg whites etc)' u'Awesome food for myself and the wife. She had the healthy wrap and added spinach and I went with the classic chicken and it was great. Will come again before heading back home! Dont think about it just come here and the staff is friendly as well. P.S good prices!' u'IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  I don\'t know how this place has this many stars; I honestly believe that the store must be deleting some of the lower ratings.\n\nI went in a Saturday morning - not busy at all.  I would say there were one or two customers already sitting and eating.  They made me wait 10 minutes before taking my order because the staff were just chatting amongs each other.  There were at least 7 people behind the counter just chatting with each other. Finally once I put in my order the man taking my order was sort of rude but I was just happy to finally put in my order so I didn\'t mind.  And then at the pick up counter the girl who was calling out people\'s order numbers said my number so quietly I couldn\'t even hear what she was saying.  But I figured it was my sandwich since I was the first of three people waiting.  To make sure I got the right sandwich I asked her "Is this the [name of sandwich]?" Without making eye contact and with a look of complete and utter disgust on her face she pretended to take another look at the receipt and repeated whatever number she called out in a barely audible voice.  So I took the sandwich and went back to the sandwich chef and asked if I had the right sandwich and he gave me such an attitude too and then laughed at me with another employee as I was walking out!  \n\nMy office is located right next door but I will be telling ALL my coworkers to NEVER go to this place for a sandwich because I had such a horrible experience here.  I don\'t even feel like eating my sandwich anymore because that experience left such a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nZERO STARS.' u'We ordered on GrubHub and the food came so fast! \n\nEvery thing tasted amazing and was made to perfection! Perfect lunch!' u'Italian on hero bread was the best cold sandwich I have had to date. (Coscia is in photo) Great prices and fast service: I went in during the lunch hour and was fed and out the door in 30". I usually don\'t eat that fast but it was too good.' u"Good average bagel nothing over the top. I gave a 3 mainly because I was expecting the bagel to be a little softer than it was. It was a little too hard (not crispy from the toaster rather hard). \n\nMy wife's bagel had amazing ingredients as you see in the picture. Her bagel was about $10. My plain sesame was priced well at about $3." u'Enjoyed the breakfast. Good food great prices. Enjoyed the breakfast wrap. Saw NBC morning show host ordering food. \nWill definitely go back in the future.' u"My boyfriend and I looked up their hours and were excited to see that it was open before we had to leave for our flight. When we got there we checked the hours on the door and confirmed it opened at 7 am on a Sunday. We walked in and we're turned away -the staff said that they open at 8 am?\n\nSo I if I could I would give them 0 stars for their Poor customer service I would. If your hours are an hour later then please change the hours on your door so no one else wastes their time trekking to your establishment to be turned away." u'It was OK. Kind of disappointing mozzarella cheese sandwich. Stale bread. My friend had borderline food poisoning after eating their breakfast wrap.' u'this review is just for the woman who takes the morning orders she is very unprofessional does not take the orders properly and when you call back to ask for the right order it WILL be a hassle. The process of getting a refund was a HEADACHE (about 3 hrs total) had to call back argue back and fourth ask to speak to a manager (& not be allowed to) the order was sent again "replaced" and still wrong. This inst the first time this happens either we\'ve received the wrong order a couple times already. I say go for a different spot D&S is good or try a different toasties its impossible to deal with the customer service here. \n\noh and make sure you check your receipt theyll try to charge you more than the actual price of' u"They have a lot of great options and aren't too pricey! My friend and I just needed a quick breakfast before heading in line to the TKTS booth to get our broadway fix in for the day. We both got a Saturday Morning but instead of a wrap we got it on a bagel. I love having that option for a nice bagel sandwich in the morning!\n\nIt was pretty cheap since it was only about $6 but still filled me up for a quick meal. The homefries in the sandwich is such a good touch and completes the typical brunch flavors you get from the eggs cheese and bacon. The salsa they put on the side is actually really good too! It has a little spicy kick to it and pairs well with the taste of the eggs and fries." u'Not necessarily what you would expect as the quintisenssial New York deli but the food was good! Service was quick to get our 5 sandwiches out; although maybe the customer service could have been better? (I would personally rather wait a moment to be able to talk to a person without a phone on their ear).\n\nThe space was clean. Only about 4 tables in the area so if they are busy you may have to take your food to go.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
94.Frisson Espresso,[u'What an amazing small coffee shop where most customers are regulars and know the people in the shop!! The decor is simple and welcoming it seats about 20 people and has 2-3 people working the counter. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and helpful and the amazing barista who helped me does an amazing work of art on the lattes with the foam. I had to order a couple to see more of his designs!!!\n\nReally enjoyed the latte and Karachi latte here. Had a blueberry scone for breakfast and that was a perfect choice also. Nice moist flaky and not too sweet. Loved this place as it just feels like you are part of their family. Great job team.' u'Came in on a rainy Sunday afternoon to a cute little coffee shop. The shop itself was pretty cozy with only a few tables and a bar on the side. \n\nThankfully when my friend and I went in there was not many people around so we got our pick of seats. You go up to the counter to order and then they call up your order in a few minutes so service itself is pretty quick. \n\nI ordered a hot chocolate and it came out in an oversized mug with cute art on it. The hot chocolate was very creamy and delicious though a bit more on the sweeter side than I would have liked. \n\nAll in all a great place to spend an hour or two catching up with friends or just spending some time away from the hustle and bustle of the busy New York City streets. \n\nAdditionally the cafe does not have restrooms so make sure to plan accordingly!' u"Just came in this afternoon. Bare bones but charming coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen. Lots of finance types coming in and out. The barista was super friendly. No credit card limit.\n\nI went with espresso-- they only pour doubles so guess I will be a little over-caffeinated this afternoon. It was $3 which is fair to low for the neighborhood. I got it in under a minute. It's not the best espresso I've had as it's on the bitter side but not bad.\n\nI hope to be impressed by the rest of their drinks! Nice looking pastries as well." u"I met up with a friend at Frisson Espresso on a Saturday morning. The caf\xe9 is quite narrow but it has four two seater tables and ample stools at the bar. I ordered a regular cappuccino. They first mistook my order for to-go rather than to-stay but they remade the drink with ease. \n\nThe baristas at Frisson are friendly. The service is quick and the caf\xe9 is clean. You can expect a solid cup of coffee at Frisson. The prices are average. One perk is if you order a regular coffee to-stay they give free refills. I would recommend Frisson if you're in the area!" u"I absolutely loved this place! My husband and I stopped in on Friday morning and grabbed a latte and coffee (free refills if you hang out) the barista and maybe the owner? (super friendly dude) were there. In any case they were both on it and their chocolate croissant was delicious and fairly inexpensive compared to other shops. It's not easy finding a place where people are genuine in this city but I would 100% recommend!" u"Very nice barista and just a very cute shop. The drinks itself were great and prepared promptly. The latte was not too bitter or burnt definitely worth the money. The hot coco was very frothy and not too sweet. Can't wait to come again." u'The coffee is great and the pastries are delicious. The space is a little small and the service is somewhat slow but the coffee is worth it. It is a special gem and great in a normally gross neighborhood.' u"My whole experience at Frisson Espresso was awful from beginning to end.\n\nI walked in after looking for coffee shops in the area with wifi. The space was very small and everyone was cramped in together. It was crowded not because there were a lot of people there but because there was not enough space to accommodate traffic in a New York City coffee shop.\n\nThe person I was with ordered a latte and I ordered the iced tea. I specifically asked what was in it and was told it was just black tea with peppermint. I asked if there was sugar added and the barista said no.\n\nWe sat down with our drinks and I got up to ask for the wifi password which he seemed annoyed about and pointed to the wall where it was written.\n\nAfter getting the wifi password I tasted my tea and it tasted far too sweet for what they said was in it. I went back up to confirm that there was in fact no added sweetener and the barista thought I was asking for the wifi password again and pointed towards the wall with the password again while rolling his eyes before I could say anything.\n\nI then was able to ask if there was added sweetener in the tea once again and said it tasted too sweet to just be iced black tea and peppermint. He then told me that there was honey as well.\n\nI wish I knew this beforehand because I could have saved myself from buying a $4 tea that I never even drank.\n\nThe employee didn't have to look this information up so he obviously knew it so I don't understand why he didn't say there was honey in it the first time around. I'll never come back even when desperate for caffeine." u"I come here just for the drip coffee on my off days.  \n\nIt's no nonsense coffee and I like to people watch from the seats at the window.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get it to stay and enjoy it in one of their ceramic mugs." u"A completely unique surprise in the heart of the theater district. While the cafes in the surrounding area are bustling with lines of tourists loud and energized - you walk into Frisson and it doesn't even feel like you're in a city. You feel drawn into their cozy warm and inviting space - transported to maybe a port town or quaint suburbia able to get some peace and quiet - maybe even open a book and disappear into that. It's a real nifty escape from the city - in the heart of one of the busiest metropolises in the world. I found myself in quiet disbelief as I entered. \n\nOrder a latte - take a seat in any of the three small sections - with a table along the wall or facing the window looking out into a city block. There is probably only about 15-20 seats maximum - but if you want to do work there are plenty of outlets available (something I do not take for granted a hot commodity missing in many SF cafes). For me this was great for catching up on some reading. I couldn't believe how comfortable it was - on a Friday afternoon/evening. I can't even imagine what it would be like on any other weekday but I imagine even better!" u"When I stumbled upon some coffee art from this coffee shop on instagram I knew it deserved a bookmark. Having arrived to New York on a cold rainy day made the walk to this coffee shop so much more worth it. \nFrisson Espresso is a cute tiny coffee shop with lots of coffee themed wall art. The baristas were friendly and helpful. I ordered a mocha latte which came with beautiful coffee art. Even though mochas are usually on the sweeter side I love that this one wasn't overly sweet it was perfect." u'Delicious fresh & strong coffee\nExtensive variety & flavors offered\nThe friendliest people work there\nVery cozy atmosphere inside (especially on a snowy day)\n\n10/10 would recommend!' u'Great little find while visiting the city. Why in the world would you go to a chain when places like this exist?  I got the coffee but the espressos and other drinks they were making looked amazing and made me wish I tried something new.  May next time.' u'A gem in the neighbourhood. Come here for a delicious variety of milk-based coffee. Their cappuccino latte cortado and hot chocolates are all delicious. If only there were more coffee spots like this in mid town west. \n\nThe cappuccinos have a perfect creamy froth with the right amount of coffee kick. The hot chocolate is creamy and smooth. The latte is milkier than the cappuccino as it should be. Both the latte and the hot chocolate come in larger quantities and mugs than the cappuccinos.\n\nThe atmosphere is small and cozy. A quiet place to get work done.' u"Such a hidden gem! Off of 8th Avenue it's a small coffee shop. Though there aren't that many seats it'd definitely be a cozy place to study or do work if you could snag a seat. \n\nI got a 20oz iced vanilla latte with an extra shot and the raspberry scone.The coffee is strong smooth but not bitter. The scone tasted amazing warmed up and it wasn't too sweet which I loved. \n\nThe only downside would be the prices. It's much more expensive than Starbucks which is already expensive in itself. My total for my latte + the scone was $11. Though it's not somewhere I can see myself coming to everyday I definitely will go when I wanna steer away from the regular Starbucks." u"Quiet little coffee shop but nothing too special (though will say there was decent seating available for the size of the shop and they had a lot of outlets by the tables - which is convenient/nice for all of us with anxiety from bad phone battery life). I came for the first time this past labor day to catch up with my friend who was staying in a hotel in the area. We laughed a ton/were probably louder than we should have been for a small coffee shop...but people (both employees and other patrons) were kind/patient and I didn't feel unwelcome despite our louder conversation. I got a iced matcha latte and it was solid." u"I travel near and far for great espresso and latte art and I'm glad I found this place! This was by far the best place for latte art...and the cappuccino tasted great too. The barista was able to put together this masterpiece even while talking to another customer and giving him directions for somewhere he was trying to get to. Impressive!" u'Very cute and cozy little shop. They ran out of pastry by noon which was disappointing since we were looking to enjoy some of that with their coffee. Overall coffee tasted good and the staff there were very friendly.' u"They make great coffee here and you get free refills on drip coffee to stay. Not many tables but if you can snag a spot it's a nice refuge from Midtown to do some work." u'The staff is very friendly. Very cute space in the theater district. Latte art is amazing. Cappuccino tastes great!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
81.Bond 45,[u"I can't say I've ever been to Bond before they renovated but I can say that they've done a magnificent job. The d\xe9cor is beautiful the food delicious and the staff attentive.\n\nI brought my family here for a pre-show meal and I can't believe it's taken me this long to come here. We were kindly greeted and seated immediately downstairs in the bar area. \n\nOur bartender Erin was absolutely charming and made sure we were well taken care of. My negroni was served with a tiny cone of popcorn (clever!) The food was delicious and well-priced for highly trafficked Times Square faire.\n\nI will however warn you: Not trying the pizza will be a mistake that will haunt you for the rest of your life! Top 5 thin-crust pizzas in NYC (To be fair Trattoria is also on the list)." u"This place has a busy pre-theatre crowd but was completely empty by 8pm. The host team is warm and welcoming but I cannot say for the other staff in the restaurant. I stood by the bar area for about 20 minutes until this other guest stood there with me while waiting for our table. A wait staff member approached her in less than a minute with a menu to offer her a drink and water. I just continue to observe the lack of attentiveness in this restaurant. I thought of some possibilities of not being offered a drink but water would have been nice. I can't seem to figure out where the bias treatment divides. \n\nAfter being seated for dinner the food was decent. The server was boring and seemed like his mind was elsewhere. The menu offered different sized portions and I thought that was great for individual eaters or family style dining. Every table had pink salt my favorite! The signature and specialty cocktail list was short and simple. I went with whatever has Tequila in it. The Pineapple infused tequila margarita was weak. It tasted like pineapple juice making me think that this drink was probably pre-batched. and they like to forget my lime garnish and my straw. \n\nThe Prosciutto and burrata mozzarella was a great starter with about four slices of prosciutto a ball of burrata mozzarella a side of olives and a light sprinkle of marcona almonds. The fried calamari was lightly battered and fried tossed with some vinegar peppers yes they were hot! \n\nThe chicken parm was thin crusted crispy and flavorful. I wanted to try the veal parm instead though. The ribeye dish was a hugh disappointment because of the mushroom red wine sauce. I did read the menu but I did not expect the steak to be drowned in the sauce. The sauce did not taste well with the steak. It really took away from a great steak. This sauce should be served on the side. The thin 14 oz steak was cooked at the perfect temperature though. It was very juicy and tender but the sauce really did killed it. Sticking to good old salt and pepper would be the best choice. The steak came with a side of cacio e pepe fries that were very mediocre I would have preferred a different potato side if given the option.\n\n The chicken and truffle pasta was made with hand crafted fettucini. The quality of the fettucini really stood out. I always enjoy a truffle dish but the chicken was lacking flavor in this dish \nThe very popular pastrami spaghetti carbonara was alright mix in the egg and you're set for a good al dente pasta dish. This dish was good but was not all that. \n\nThe dessert menu had a great selection of chocolate chip pecan cookie chocolate cake smores pizza pie etc. \n\nOverall I would not go out of my way to recommend this place or be back on my own but if someone invites me to their dinner at Bond45 I would just sit in for a bite." u"Apparently Bond 45 has been around for quite some time but new to this location. And what a great location it is. Right across from the theatre that houses Hamilton.  \nWe stopped in for drinks before the show. We had about 45 minutes and let our waiter know we had a 7pm curtain. He laughed and said he could get a 3 course meal done in 45 minutes. I'm a little skeptical but good to know for the future. \nWe stuck with cocktails and experienced great service. \nThe antipasto bar upstairs looked fantastic. We will surely check out this place for food another time." u"Food outstanding ambience was great service not bad. It really wasn't bad but it wasn't super friendly either. I'm finding this is pretty standard in NYC restaurants though!" u"Had dinner tonight at the new location for Bond 45 (on *46th* Street). It's halfway between the office and home--noticed it the other day walking by. The wonderful manager said they didn't have any tables but if we came in an hour they could take care of us. Being a local in this 'hood it can be hard to find a good restaurant that isn't trying to be a one-off for tourists. So we came back and the food was even better than we expected. The manager sweetly treated us to a veggie combo appetizer. \n\nWe had:\n- veg appetizer: Sicilian eggplant lovely and not overpowering with capers and olives; roasted Brussels sprouts; cauliflower Milanese lightly coated served warm; broccoli rabe tender yet still crisp nicely not bitter; roasted peppers. I'd get the eggplant and Brussels sprouts again. \n- lasagna with short rib meatball -- delish. \n- chicken parmigiana two ways (half had pepperoni on top half did not) crispy and also delicious. \n- dessert: chocolate blackout cake it's really good!\n\nDefinitely a 4+. Moved it to 5 stars because the service was so sweet professional and responsive. (I can be demanding at times and they gave me everything I wanted with a smile.)" u"We stopped in for a small meal. The staff was engaging and friendly.  We had the larger portion of meatballs that was delicious with tasteful red sauce/gravy.  The Cesar salad was made with either fresh baby butter lettuce or romaine and the dressing was nicely topped with cheese. The server/waiter was attentive to our simple order brought a steaming pot of coffee at just the right time and didn't make us wait for the check when we were finished.  \nThank you for an enjoyable meal." u'We had a really nice dining experience this weekend at Bond 45. So glad to see the restaurant back open after the "hiatus as it was really missed. \n\nThe new restaurant  location is now on 46th Street directly across from the Richard Rogers Theater where Hamilton is running part of the Hotel Edison.  \n\nThe food was just the way we left it and it\'s so nice to have it back again. All the old favorites are back in the menu especially the bone in veal chop. \n\nJonathan was our sever and he was very attentive and provided us with excellent service. He helped carry on the warm friendly tradition we\'ve always grown accustomed to from dining at Bond 45. \n\nPortions are still big and the food is just as good as I remember it from the other location. We will definitely be back.  So happy to have my favorite theater district restaurant back in biz again!' u"Loved Bond45! We went during opening week and the service was impeccable! They have an anti pasta buffet that is so cool and delicious! When you go order the bolognese lasagna. It was probably the best thing I've eaten in a really long time. All the pasta is made in house and it was soooooooo good. The chefs and staff there really deserve awards for creating an amazing menu and fantastic service. They even accommodated us and got all our food and dessert to us with enough time before our play began. Can't wait to go back!" u"Overall my experience was good. The restaurant is large with a fantastic display case in the front as you enter delicious looking vegetables and salads that you can get as part of their appetizer platters. \n\nVery vegetarian-friendly which I happen to be my party was not and we all found something  delicious to eat. \n\nService was good. For Manhattan the prices were very reasonable. Many wines were not available by the glass so that was disappointing. \n\nThe bread was very good but it was served cold and we realized later that other tables had been brought oil and vinegar for dipping which our server apparently had forgotten. That would have made the bread much better. \n\nI found the menu a little confusing but our server was very helpful in explaining. I did find it a little odd for an Italian restaurant to not offer sides with the majority of the entrees. Everything had to be ordered a la cart.\n\n I was not a fan of the lower-level restrooms I realize that nowadays communal restrooms are commonplace. But the setup was awkward and there was a line out the door into the hallway where people were passing so it was not very comfortable. I happen to be an interior designer so I am very picky about such things perhaps most people wouldn't mind but I found it awkward.\n\n There is also a single person restroom on the main level also awkward since it is around the corner where all of the staff has to pass and the wait station is also there so again not a good location for such things. Although this is Manhattan and some floor plans just can't be helped due to utilities.\n\n The food was delicious in the end and the bill was very reasonable I would definitely return especially if you're going to dinner prior to a show." u"A long-time favorite in the Theatre District has reopened in a new location after an extended closure. A crowded Italian bistro serving some of the best thin crust pizza in the city. Elbow-to-elbow with theatre goers and a mouth watering menu with some of the friendliest servers around. Well worth the visit and if you don't want to have a seat there's always a takeout option." u'This place re-opened near my work location.  I\'ve been to the old store and now this new one across from the New York Marriott Marquis.  Both times I\'ve hosted customers.  They\'re absolute professionals with career waiters who care.  They serve Italian food that\'s authentic with a slice of Italian-American tradition.  In addition to very good Italian dishes you can still get the "standards" like parmigiana and Milanese.  They have a very unique antipasto offering that is truly well done; from Milanese cauliflower to a risotto stuffed roasted pepper to roasted root-veg; just simple and perfect.  Great place for lunch and dinner at a fair price for midtown Manhattan.' u"First time at the new incarnation and it's the perfect post-theater spot. We like to eat after seeing plays and it's terrific to have a late-night Italian place in midtown. The pizza is cracker-crust thin and tasty. I had a great pasta. On my god the blackout cake was the best. (Ebbinger's was before my time but this was damn fine.)\n\nOh we also had delightful and attentive service. It's our new post-play place when we're in NYC." u"We went to this restaurant for my in-law's visit to NYC for my mother in law's birthday. It was very nice they offered us a flute of champagne before dinner to celebrate. Our reservation was at 5:45. The ambience was wonderful and our waiter Dmitrious was charming and warm and professional. However our meal didn't arrive until 7:20 and we had an 8pm show a few blocks away with an elderly mobility impaired couple. We flagged down the waiter several times but there was never any acknowledgement apology or explanation for the long wait of over an hour. The lasagne was good but very very salty. I swelled up during the show! All the food was excellent but we had to eat so fast to finish in time for the show that it took the pleasure out of the meal. Again no apology or anything-- and no effort to celebrate my mother in law's birthday with a candle or dessert. So two stars. Disappointed." u'The beer was good and the desserts were better. When I asked the waitress if they gave military discounts she replied with "no no we definitely don\'t give any discounts"! Well with that attitude I definitely won\'t be coming back. She could have said it a little nicer.' u'Overall a great experience. we did make reservations the table was a tad wobbly so a 10 year old or a drunk friend will be an issue. the veal was fantastic the calamari very good and the mozzarella was great. the mater dee  was on top of his game and the service was adequate and polite.' u"Had a great experience at the old location and decided to take my daughter here for her birthday. It started off bad- The appetizers were all served  at different times so we couldn't even start eating together. Then it took them an hour for our food to arrive. When it did it was cold and it looked like they took no effort whatsoever.  Utterly disappointing. We didn't even eat the food- we asked for the bill. They kindly waived the bill because it was so bad." u'Delicious! The fried cauliflower appetizer and the shrimp and crab cake entree with risotto was great!' u"Service was the BEST BEST I have ever had.  I was meeting my sister she's in from out of town and we were meeting for lunch.  She gave me the address but I was late train trouble.  The host helped me look no luck.  I had her home in FL and Panama home #s but not her cell.  I am not tech savvy and could not find her number they found it I called and she was back in a few minutes.  They went the extra mile.  The wait staff was fantastic.  The manager even came by with home made cooks.  The food was Devine. What a wonderful experience.  I will be back.  BRAVO to one and all.  Oh the price was very reasonable." u'Food was classic casual but still delightful. Wish the plates had some combo style options - which reportedly was more of the case in the last location. Waiter said they are still working on a scaled down opening menu (as of Oct 2017). Big shout out to the front of house staff who really seemed to be accommodating - given the location they must get all styles and speeds in there - and they did a great job hosting all around. Look out (or ask) for the complimentary warm chocolate cookies at the end' u'A welcome addition to the theater district Bond45 serves up authentic Italian cuisine comparable to the best and most famous NYC restaurants. We were seated on time in a comfortable booth and served quickly in order to make Hamilton which is just across the street. Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced from the chopped salad and fried artichokes to the cold antipasto all the appetizers were amazing. The pasta courses are to die for our faves were the Tordelli Bolognese and the Lobster Bolognese which at $28 including 2 whole lobster tails in a yummy Fra Diavolo sauce is an absolute steal. Kuddos for having my fave drink on the menu Bellini made with real peach nectar and do not miss the Blackout Chocolate Cake. We will definitely return both for pre-theater dinner as well as lunch my husband works in the neighborhood and will certainly entertain clients here. Also there is a huge room and bar in the basement decorated to make it feel as if you are outside perfect for a private party or perhaps nightlife once word spreads about this wonderful place finally re-opening in the beautifully renovated Edison Hotel.'],0.9499,0.312,0.688,0.0
165.Haven Rooftop,[u'Great service and cool environment.\nThere is no view per se but it gets lit on weekdays and it is close to my office.\nWe had their Malbec and Crispy Calamari all great.' u"I went here with a friend for an early dinner on a Monday evening and it was not that crowded but as it got darker and the view got even prettier more people started showing up this rooftop is a part of a hotel and you need to be 21 to eat a meal here! \nThe ambience was good the view was pretty I was expecting it to be more airy since it is a rooftop but there is a roof and big glass windows surrounding the place. The service and the view makes me give this place the 3 stars I have given.\nThe food wasn't that great not a lot of options. The dinner menu was literally one side of a menu card and the other side only listed alcoholic drinks they don't have any mocktails but would make any cocktail virgin if you ask HOWEVER they'll charge you the same amount for your virgin drink  their drinks are expensive ($14 and up) but at least they should charge less for the virgin one (like any other normal place would do). We ordered the mezze platter (on our servers suggestion) white pizza and fish tacos. The best out of all 3 was the fish tacos and even they were your average fish tacos nothing special! The white pizza was a dried up bread with cheese on top the one your 12 year old sister could make at home! I'd rather get the 99cents pizza two blocks away! The mezzo platter which the server said was amazing turned out to be a bunch of raw vegetables with a few cold pieces of pita bread nothing special or creative and def not worth the money.\nIf you wana go for the ambience and view you'll have a great time here but you'll be wasting your time n money if you're m expecting good food!" u'Came here once for drinks and apps with my sister. We entered the building and waiting on line to be escorted to the elevator (kind of thought that was really cool) when we got off the elevator we were greeted by a woman and was given the choice to choose where we wanted to sit. They had music playing very friendly staff.\n\nWe ordered our drinks which was a margarita pitcher (groupon deal) and we got crab cakes. The only downside would be we were expecting two crab cakes or at least a good portion we only got one small crab cake that was overpriced! the drinks were pretty good; we were actually planning on only ordering drinks and apps but we got really hungry and after that small appetizer for like $10 or $11 we decided to order dinner so we ordered steak and fries the steak was delicious! \n\nOveral The place itself is very relaxing. Just wished they had more options and fuller portions.' u'Not an open air rooftop and no real views to speak of. It was hot and muggy but if you position yourself in front of a fan it\'s bearable. We didn\'t try any food but had a round of margaritas and shared a pitcher of sangria. The drinks were a 6/10 but our server Mai was sweet and attentive. \nIt got really busy around 5:30 and the music volume suddenly escalated to a crazy level of loud which doesn\'t bother me if the music is good. It was crappy pop style dance music which was near deafening. \nThere was also a bizzare occurrence of waves of a "propane-like" oder that came in regularly over the patio. \nI\'m 100% positive there are exponentially better roof tops in this area of the city.' u"This is a cute place. It's not a rooftop with the best views as it's not located pretty high up.  make a reservations if you want a table. They do have a happy hour until 6. Margaritas are 10 bucks at that time. Other than that cocktails are roughly $14 which is pretty pricey for a drink in my opininon. I ate and had a Maui sandwhich which was just okay it wasn't  worth the $24. This place is super expensive. They do have a 15% check in offer forna first time visit." u'Just had brunch and had a great time! We wanted to do a rooftop brunch but were upset when we found out it was raining. This place is great because their rooftop deck can be covered when weather is bad but you still get a good view. They do bottomless drinks you can chose from mimosas bloody marys or sangria.  Our server Angel was so helpful and friendly.  Highly suggest this place for anyone looking for a Sunday brunch!' u"I've been here a couple of times for post work happy hours. Honestly not sure what the deal is at night but during the day I am not a fan of this place at all. The view is really poor but yet they charge for drinks as if you are at 230 fifth. Give me a break.  The space is rather small and it feels like a sauna during the summer - no air flow and a couple of fans that cool off only about 5 square feet leaving the rest of the room sweltering hot. Skip this one." u'LOVE IT!!!!!!\na little expensive but oh so worth it!!!!! Only wish the DJ rocked out a little longer' u"View great. Beer cold. Service Eh.\nI had the crab chunks with avocado it was ok. But nothing can beat the New York rooftop view. Over all it wasn't a horrible place." u'Most ridiculous spot ever. They think they are way more than they are. You would think you were on line at a world famous night club. Puleez.' u"Visited last night for cocktails. Pretty busy for a Monday night!! The space is huge but no beautiful views of the city. Service was friendly and attentive; could tell a lot of them were new and still training. I found the food a bit pricey for the portions.... but it's Times Square I guess... \nStill had a nice time. Will go back!" u"Came for happy hour. There only deals are on wine and beer till 7pm... ordered four cocktails and total was $52 (excluding tip).\n\nPlace is tiny and seating is limited so don't go with a big group. Not much view for a 'rooftop' bar. The only view you'll get is the residential/commercial building surrounding this hotel. So if you're looking for the scenic view this place isn't for you. \n\nHotel lobby itself is extremely nice and workers were friendly. It's not too bad if you work around the area and want to grab a quick drink before dinner" u'This is a nice venue. Cool ambiance on the rooftop. Fans but no AC. Waiters and waitresses were very attentive. We got a table and ordered drinks. The cuddle on the beach shots were good. Even thought about having their ski shots which would have been fun but too much work.\n\nThe hummus and pita were  a warm and tasty appetizer!' u"Very chill rooftop bar located in a convenient spot. Doesn't really offer good views but the atmosphere is always nice. I've been here about 5 times and it's never been annoyingly crowded. They're basically a restaurant as well on one side which is nice - it keeps the place fairly quiet and enjoyable. Drinks and everything else are reasonably priced compared to similar places. \n\nThe biggest plus is that their rooftop is fully covered with a retractable awning on one side so when it rains the place is still open. Would definitely go back to hang out here again." u'I wish I could give this place more stars. I have been here multiple times and love the atmosphere and friendly/attentive staff. From the hostess who always greets me with a smile to the servers who are ever accommodating this place makes you feel special. If only the food was up to par. \n\nThe deciding factor for me unfortunately occurred last night when I took my partner there for a last minute date night. As always I was promptly greeted and taken to a beautiful table. I ordered the Tuna while my partner had the White Pizza. I try to stay away from gluten so I cannot speak for the pizza but my partner seemed to love it. We both enjoyed the Tuna (but it was not our favorite)\n\nMy issue with the food here occurred later that night in bed when my stomach started to turn. What happened next can only be described as multiple trips back and forth to the bathroom. Seeing that my partner has the same issue it has to be the tuna (it was the only thing we both ate together all day). While I will probably return for the casual drink and maybe small bites I will most likely not be coming back for dinner.' u"I got the Living Social deal for dinner as it was so close to my job. I called 3 times but no one answered so I made a reservation online but called again to make sure they accept Groupon for Friday night still no answer so I left voicemail. Someone called me after 15 mins & confirmed my reservation.\n\nAs you entire the hotel its very beautiful & everyone is very professional. They gave us free coat check in and guide us through the elevator to go on rooftop. There was no line. Rooftop is on 10th floor which is not that high to see city beautiful view. As its winter season rooftop was covered with drapes and heat was on. Decor was beautiful but you can't see much outside as the view is blocked.\n\nWe were seated as soon as we got there. Love the table set up as its spacious & not too close to each other. I am glad bar area for happy hour is separate from Dinner area so you don't have witness loud happy hour crowd. It was not that busy so service was pretty fast.\n\nGroupon deal was 2 cocktails 1 appetizer 2 entree. Of course we ordered more than that & paid the difference.Cocktails was very well made & food was above average .\n\nI am taking 1 star away as they charged $10 for Bottle water which I think is ridiculous.\n\nOverall nice place after work for drinks or dinner for couple friends or family." u"This place was really bad. Service was slow and the drink specials were not good. They made us sit in 100 different places. \nPissed about it!!!! Don't come here unless you want to be sad" u'DO NOT GO this place\nThe worst place in NY if you plan to go with a child although it looks like a family place. They kicked our ass after we waited 1 hour for a table(we made reservation)' u"I couldn't review it because I never made it to the bar.  They make you check your backpack on the ground floor. It was the only bag I had so I had to leave I had no pockets to carry my wallet phone lipstick tampons. Real stupid policy what bar doesn't let you have a bag?  And I'm talking a small backpack not the kind you go camping with.  Stupid." u"Stumbled upon a sign for this bar as we were walking out of Times Square. We happened to be looking for a rooftop bar and coincidentally came across this one so we decided to give it a try.\n\nWhen you walk into the lobby of the hotel it's very small but seems intimate and luxurious. The staff made us feel very welcomed and special even though we were just going to the bar. They took us up to the rooftop and asked the hostess to please seat us (talk about fancy service!).\n\nWe sat in a comfortable lounge area and I ordered a whiskey-based cocktail on the menu (I can't remember the name but it had mint). It was strong and good if you like mint. It was November so of course it wasn't open-air but it still offered nice views of the area. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night and the bar area was quiet but this is still a nice place for cool vibes nice views and a chill atmosphere."],0.8847,0.32,0.68,0.0
34.Times Square Diner,[u"Holy breakfast Batman!  Wow this joint was jumping every time we went buy. We decided to wait on Friday morning and it didn't take long o get a seat. Really good service.\n\nCorned beef hash oh my! Good home fries and eggs. Also a lovely egg sandwich on a nice roll. Finally banana and Nutella stuffed French toast soft and moist and really fantastic. Damn good coffee too." u"Great spot for a quick bite when you're in the area. We were pressed for time since we slept in Sunday morning and had plans in the afternoon but still wanted some grub. Since we were staying literally across the street I looked up the Times Square Diner on yelp and decided to give it a shot.\n\nThere was a bit of a line but it moves quickly. We ended up getting seated at the bar and it was perfect. Lots of breakfast and lunch options. I ended up just getting an egg and cheese on an english muffin with home fries. Maybe it's because I was starving but I found the sandwich to be quite tasty as I scarfed it down. The home fries plate was huge! But sadly not that great. I liked that it had peppers and onions but it could've used a little more seasoning. My bf got an omelette with home fries and toast. He said the omelette was pretty good. Coffee was decent too.\n\nIt took less than 5 minutes to get our food once we placed our order. This place is definitely a well oiled machine. Place was clean service was friendly and prices are great for New York." u"We ate breakfast here twice over the weekend. The spot is small and unremarkable but clean. Service is great! Everyone was friendly professional and efficient. \n\nThe food was good. If you want a complete breakfast order the hungry man (I think that's the name). It's at the very bottom of the menu and can be easily missed but is the best bang for your buck. For $16 you get an astronomical amount of food...2 large sausage bacon ham 3 large pancakes potatoes and eggs. It really is enough for two people! I'm removing a star only because the potatoes lacked flavor and the pancakes are a bit bland. The second day I had french toast which was better than the pancakes. I will also note that they bring out the food fast and when I say fast I mean I've had fast food take longer. Overall good breakfast!" u"Great diner food. Tons of selections and everyone from our 10 person group (filled with gluten free people vegetarians and normal people too) were able to find something they liked. Granted we were all super hungry but I think everyone was surprised how great the food was. Even the playing was impressive for a diner. \n\nOh did I forget to mention that they accommodated our 10 person group with ease? It's impressive for any restaurant to make it happen and we were very relieved. Extra star for that honestly.\n\nI personally had the disco fries. Yum. And a cheap meal for NYC." u'Awesome food. Huge serving with excellent service and reasonable prices (for Manhattan). When we arrived at 10:30 am there was a line to get in which took us about 15 mins. The decor is older style diner with booth table seating and bar seats. The menu was huge with lots to choose from.  I had a difficult time trying to decide what I wanted (breakfast or lunch).  We sat at the bar and immediately the bartender gave us water and took our drink orders. Once we ordered the food took about 10 mins to arrive.  The bar appears to be a full bar but since we went there during lunch we did not see a drink menu nor was there any push to order bar drinks.  A great place to visit if you want an inexpensive (for NY) but large portion meal.  Enjoy!' u"Went there for breakfast.  There was a short line but other reviews made me want to go anyway.  Only waited in line for about 15 minutes.  We sat at the bar in order to get a quicker seat.  I ordered the banana blast stuffed French toast.  I asked for a side of the corned beef hash too because the pictures others had posted made it look irresistible.  Well I may never eat canned corned beef hash again.  This place blew me out of the water with their corned beef hash.  So fresh and tasty!  The stuffed French toast didn't disappoint either.  Plenty of bananas and PLENTY of Nutella.  I almost couldn't finish but it was too good to leave behind.  Excellent service very prompt to bring out the food.  Great place!" u"Amazing! Couldn't really decide where to go and looked up places nearby. This was one of the options. First time here and I'll definitely be back. Good portions good prices amazing food. Variety of options for food. Worth the money the wait (as I can totally see why people come here). Can't wait to come back :)" u'Located in the center of things. A rather crowded and noisy place and the food (we ate omelets) was reasonable minus. The only advantage to other diners was in the area of \u200b\u200binterest next to Times Square' u"A solid breakfast choice if you don't mind a small wait. This place runs like a well-oiled machine. You order and your food comes out in probably 5 minutes. You don't feel rushed at all but as soon as you get up to leave there are people clearing away your table for the next guests to be seated. \n\nThe food is good. Classic diner style food. The Corned Beef Hash & Eggs was pretty good and a HUGE portion (get ready to share). The omelets are a good size and the pancakes are the size of the plate and come as a 3-stack. The waffle is a pretty classic waffle -- nothing fancy. \n\nIf you don't mind a small wait and you just want some good ol' fashioned simple diner breakfast food then this is a solid choice! \n\nNot great for big groups. We had a group of 5 and they had to kind of shove a table against a small booth so if you have a big crowd I'd go elsewhere" u'I ate here twice two days in a row during my recent trip to NYC.  Based on my experience this place is everything that it is advertised to be: a great all-american diner located next to Times Square.  I was in a time crunch when dining here but that was not a problem becuase the service is speedy.  I was seated quickly and the waiters delivered my drinks food and check quickly.  I ordered a create your own omelet with spinach mushroom and cheddar.  They were generous with the ingredients and it was served with breakfast potatoes.  Really good! The prices are reasonable given the location.  The restaurant has updated decor and seemingly very clean. Definitely will return!' u'Great food and fabulous service! This is our new "Go To" restaurant in NYC!  The food is delicious the staff is friendly and efficient and the menu is varied.  Oh and the he prices are great considering the large portions!  We\'ve been here five days in a row and will be back the next week one we are in NYC!  We tried another nearby restaurant for dinner and regretted it.' u"For a 24 hour diner place I expected mediocre food but boy was this the complete opposite! We were a group of 9 and we took over the bar seating! Our waiter was attentive and quick! I ordered the corn beef hash and it was the best I've had in awhile! Definitely looking forward to coming back next time I'm in the area!" u"One of the worst burgers I've ever had. Felt like it was cooked 2 days ago and the same goes for the fries as well. Added to that quite expensive for the kind of quality it serves. Unfortunately it was the only place open around times square at 3 in the morning. Better visit Mcdonalds than this.\n\nAdded to all of those no wifi!!!! Like is 1970s" u"This place was a hidden gem in Manhattan. It's a little place but we went because the reviews were so good. It did not disappoint. The food was excellent and the service was great too. I will definitely b coming back here when I visit Mew York Again. I had the Ruben my nephew had the gyro and my daughters boyfriend had a burger. They all got thumbs up." u"While I liked the granola pancakes with a large glass of OJ and sausage links the big let down was the syrup. \n\nWhat was that stuff? We're in the northeast hasn't grade A maple syrup been heard of? I'm sorry but the bland syrup took a very much look forward to a meal and disappointed me.\n\nElse the welcoming service and atmosphere is worthwhile returning for another trip but not anything dealing with syrup. Sad pancakes are a major reason to eat in the US." u'Great food and great people what more could ask for in a diner!!  \n\nThe location itself makes it a perfect find being just a few blocks off time square is oh so convent!  It is small but well organized and fast!!  We were a walk in of 8 + baby and they sat is in 15 minutes!  Then we ordered and our food was there in a flash!\n\nWe all had breakfast from Eggs Benedict to pancakes to just an egg/cheese sandwich.  Everything we cooked to perfection with great flavors.  As with any diner in the northeast the portions were large an no one could finish there plate :)' u"Yum ! Good old fashion NY diner big portions endless cups of coffee great service . I had a western omelette and substituted the home fries for there hand cut fries  yummm delicious . Of course you cannot have an omelette in NY without a toasted bagel oh wait that's just me LOL . Good spot for breakfast and they are very busy on the weekends." u'I was really trying to go to Juniors for breakfast but they stop serving early.  Lo and behold this place serves my favorite meal (breakfast) 24/7.  \n\nEach omelette is served with hash browns and toast.  I asked for the complimentary pickled beets.  What the heck???  It\'s free!!  To my surprise the beets were really good.  \n\n"I\'ll be back!"' u"Everyone was friendly other than our waitress. She was rude miserable and one of the least attentive waitresses we had during this trip. \n\nIt started with the fact she wouldn't give us 30 seconds to look at the menus. Our friend who was running late from Brooklyn had no time to look  at the menu. He asked bout the Chicken dinner. Her response was...that takes 30 min. Like really?\n\nShe then forgot the fries...and cracked an attitude when I asked for them. \n\nDon't worry it got better. She never checked on us. I asked a really nice server with glasses ... big guy. He was awesome. We saw how attentive he was with his tables...if he could grab our check. Our waitress was sitting at the bar having soup and couldn't be bothered. \n\nI'm sure the owner won't see this or even care. It's a shame...with so many other options in midtown...I'll not be back!" u"Location is convenient especially when you are coming out of the Book of Mormon show and starving. \nThe short rib was tender and the broccoli was properly cooked and had some flavor which some places forget and leave veggies bland. \nThe French onion soup was surprisingly good as it did not look overly appetizing to the eye. It wasn't overly salted and was an overall yummy soup. \nThe chili my boyfriend was a fan of. I don't particularly like chili. \nA decent place diner style with the Manhattan prices."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
186.Minar Indian Restaurant,[u"I have a theory on restaurants in midtown Manhattan - the less glitzy and elaborate the storefront is the better the food inside will be. Eschew the bright lights of every corner deli and fancy eatery and dig into the tiny hole-in-the wall restaurants tucked into the cross streets. With that in mind Minar passes the test with flying colors. Hidden away on 46th street between the lights of Times Square and the bustling 6th Avenue the restaurant is only about a hallway width with a line snaking all the way back to the counter. \n\nFood is plated up quickly and their Chicken Tikka Masala is served with either rice or naan bread. As opposed to other restaurants Minar goes very heavy with their sauce drowning their rice in delicious orange goodness. Prices are very reasonable for the midtown location and the chicken falls apart in tender chunks after being poked with a fork. Although reckoning with the subsequent food coma two hours later is a slight downside this has become one of my top places to grab food when I'm craving Indian" u'Very reasonable spot. Their garlic nan is delish.\nCurries here are pretty well cook always a line at lunch. \nThis is a popular place to grab a quick lunch.\nI tried their chicken curry which I find the curry to be really runny. They give you way too much rice too.\nAll their nans are freshly cooked in the backs and taste delish.' u"Not a bad lunch option for the area!\n\nThe good:\n- very good prices for what you get\n- good vegetarian and non-vegetarian options to pick from\n- considerable portions ability to get multiple food choices\n- good dhal\n- amazing naan\n\nThe bad:\n- pretty small and not very easy to find a seat during lunch hours\n- quite oily specially some of their vegetarian dishes\n\nOver all a decent option in the area if you're craving Indian food but don't want to splurge and can take your food back to the office!" u'Food portion and the prices were drastically different. If you decide to eat here I recommend asking the prefixes and choosing the lunch or dinner menus. Food was average.' u"Our office orders from here all the time and the food is consistently good. I usually get the chicken tikka masala which never lets me down but today I got the lamb saag and it might be my new favorite. Nice big chunks of lamb and the spinach sauce is spicy which I liked. They always package our food nicely and never forget items (which happens a lot with big order like ours!). Each person gets their own labeled paper bag labeled with their food sauces utensils napkin and plate. I don't think all that stuff is necessary but it's definitely appreciated!" u'Great food. Very inexpensive. Fresh bread.\nVery authentic place it feels like you went to India for an hour. Just go.' u'Oh boy was I scared about my lunch when I saw these reviews. I wound up looking at the reviews AFTER I ordered. Rookie move. Anyway pleasantly surprised! I was going to give them 4 stars for excessive delivery time (ordered at 1 PM food arrived at 2:15 PM) but then realized it\'s also pouring rain and the poor delivery guy had literally 10 delivery bags for Minar on his arms when he showed up. This place is doing something right. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka lunch special comes with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala rice naan salad and veg of the day. The portion of rice was huge and very flavorful I was just eating it plain before I dug into anything else. Naan was fresh and fluffy and chewy. Veg of the day? Not sure what it would be called but it was string beans peas carrots and potato pieces in a spicy tomato based sauce. Chicken Tikka was good as well very large tender pieces of chicken that fell apart when I poked my fork in it. I\'m sitting here stuffed and there\'s still two big pieces in the container. It\'s definitely a sweet Tikka Masala but very tasty and flavorful and awesome sauce to dip naan in. The "salad" lol. Can\'t really call it a salad. It was shredded lettuce and onion in aluminum foil. It made me laugh but at least the onions were crunchy and the lettuce wasn\'t brown or wilted! \n\nThis is a lot of food for the price you pay. Wouldn\'t hesitate ordering again might just order earlier in the day to avoid the backup and long wait.' u"TERRIBLE. I'm so incredibly un-satisfied. 2 hours to deliver 1 block away I called 3 times lying to me on the phone. When it did arrive cold watery honestly barley edible. I will NEVER order from here again I usually order from Indian Project which is incredible - always hot and on time. This place is a joke. I don't even write reviews anymore but this was so bad I felt everyone should know before attempting this place that it's a huge waste of time and money." u"This place is a hole in the wall in Times Square.  What it lacks in decor it makes up for in price and quality food.  We went twice this time and I would gladly go back.  I had the chicken tikka masala the naan and the mixed vegetable curry.  All are tasty.  \nJust be prepared to order off the buffet it's easier. Prices are 10-12 per entree.  They also let you try multiple curries for 11.95" u'I have tried this place to go thrice when I was staying in Mid Manhattan. \n\nThe food options I tried- \n\nAlu Parathas - 4.5/5*\nGobhi Parathas - 4.5/5*\nVeggie Platter - 4/5*\nIdlis - 3/5*\n\nI found this place great value for your bucks. Always got the food hot and delivered to the lobby of my hotel in 40 minutes. I found their parathas very delicious. The quality of food is good. Parathas are cooked in tandoor so they are not very oily. They serve this with yogurt raita.   \nIddly thats how it is spelt in their menu are tasted decent. Sambhar and coconut chutney are nothing great but Iddly( rice and lentil steamed pan cakes) were soft and tasted fine.\nVeggie Platter - It came with Naan rice and two vegetarian entree choices. I opted for gobi alu and yellow dal. Gobi alu is worth mentioning. It was well prepared and looked like it is prepared by some experienced Indian chef. \nI will definitely recommend this if you are staying in Manhattan.They deliver hot food and delicious food. Definitely try their parathas (( Wheat Roti filled with boiled and potatoes(seasoned with spices ) cauliflower stuffings))!' u'This Indian restaurant was ok in the food department. There are better places to eat Indian food.  I ordered 2 veg. lunch plates off seamless... after 35 mins only 1 arrived. ... I called to ask for the other plate to be delivered. They \'accidentally\' hung up. I called back they said they would refund the order. I said "no I\'d still like it delivered.\' Figuring I\'d be on the priority of the food ordering list... when another 25 mins rolls by I call again. \n\nThis is when I get annoyed. See instead of being met with when the food would actually arrive I was met with "food take times to cook." "I have other orders to take." and lots of "ma\'am"\n\nWell according to the REVIEWS it seems all of it is pre-ready in pots and ready to go. Especially a Veg Platter combo.\n\nI was told it would be another 5-10mins. \n\nAs I said "Well I hope it\'s here by then because..." then I was HUNG UP ON.\n\nI called back and demanded an apology. To hang up was so rude especially as a "already paid" customer. \n\nI rarely write reviews. BUT this experience was so awful! I had to give them only 1 star. \n\nJust a hopeless delivery situation.' u'Minar is my go to spot for Indian food near my job. I always get the vegetarian platter that has your choice of rice or Naan. \nI get the rice with saag paneer vegetables and cauliflower with potatoes.\nEverything is so flavorful.\nThe only issue is the seating is iffy. My coworker and I were lucky to grab a table but it was so crowded the line was almost to the door.' u"Full disclosure:  I am an Indian food snob because I grew up eating Indian food and am used to really GREAT Indian food.  Having said that Minar is just ok.  I used to work in the area and this place was always packed with people waiting on line during lunch time (not so much for dinner time). There really is no competition in the neighborhood since there are very few Indian restaurants in the area. Everything is pretty much pre-made and kept hot in steam tables;  their naan however is made fresh to-order.  This restaurant is more like a cafeteria style than a waiter service type restaurant.  But for this type restaurant the food is decent enough and great if you want something quick.  I came here for a quick pre-theatre meal and it was pretty good.  I chose the non-vegetarian combo (about $11) which came with 1 meat item and two veg items.  You have a choice between naan or rice (I opted for the rice).  They kindly offer free water in the fridge and it's help yourself with plastic cups available.  \n\nMy meal included:  \ngoat curry (good) \nsaag paneer (good)\nchana masala (it was way too salty;  probably had been in the steam tables too long and some liquid dried out resulting in over salty tasting food)\nbasmati rice\n\n." u'Pretty standard Indian food.  Nothing special.  I found them on GrubHub but the quality of the dishes is inconstant and the delivery to be next to impossible. At BEST they take forever. More likely than not the order is wrong.  Specifically if you order 2 of the same dish 1 arrives and TRUST me...   Just a hopeless delivery situation. \n\nTo top it off they are ludicrously rude on the phone.  \n\nThere are SO many other great Indian restaurants out there.  I suggest you try one of THEM especially if you are going to have it delivered and even more so if you want to eat your lunch before 3pm.' u'Def solid take-out indian food.  Not the best or anything spectacular but good and cheap. The Chicken Tikka Biryani is a great choice.' u'Do NOT order from them ever!  I received my order over 1 hour late and had to make several phone calls.  First she said its on the way then she said the guy was calling and no one was answering so he came back while she was telling me that made up story I received the call from the delivery guy to come down to get my order.\n\nI get my order (naturally its his last order) come upstairs and it\'s missing the one thing I specifically asked for naan.  I notice this and call back immediately (within 2 minutes of receiving my order)... and I hear her asking the someone in the background what happened to the nann his response "the order had naan I don\'t think I put it in the bag"  She gets back on the phone and tells me "yes its definitely in the bag"  I check again anyway no naan.  She tells the guy "no he\'s not buying it he said there\'s nothing in the bag" he tells her "okay it was a small order we\'re not going to send someone there just for naan" she gets back on the phone with me and says there\'s no one to deliver it will take over 1 hour to send it.  I tell her the guy that just delivered my order had nothing else in his bag send him with it as soon as he gets back to which she tells me "no he came back already and left with orders it may even be over an hour I\'ll just send it next time" which is absolutely impossible for him to bike 15 blocks and reload with a batch of orders within 2-4 minutes of having left from my office.  Shameless lie.\n\nComplete liars very unprofessional horrible customer service and mediocre food.  It was cold when it got here.\n\nNever again.' u'They do catering for weddings! \n\nWe had them cater food for our wedding and it was just amazing. The price point for catering is a little high. They offer an extensive range of menu items for events. The food is delicious and they come in with all the fancy Indian decorations to jazz up the service. \n\nEven if the event is at a remote location (our wedding was in Albany) they do a great job at serving fresh food. The only regret we have is that being the Bride and Groom we did not get to try out the food they served. But our guests raved about the food and enjoyed at our reception. \n\nTheir Carrot Halwa is a must try. It was freshly prepared at the venue and was all gone by the end of the event. \n\nAll in all great service and amazing food! Thank you to the entire team to all the effort you put in. Greatly appreciated!!' u'I placed an order through seamless I never received my food I called the restaurant 15 min after the time my food was supposed to be delivered  the lady said that delivery guy was on his way 30 min went by and still no food  called the restaurant and told them I wanted to cancel my order the lady did not even apologize 2 and a half hours later a man called and asked me if I would like my food delivered within 30 min ! Are you crazy ! So I never received my food and will never order from there again !' u"Perfectly decent place for what it is and where it's located. I'd give it a solid 5 stars if they served beer and if they came down a bit on the prices. \n\nI see most of the negative reviews come from those who rely on delivery. What douchebags. Get off your lazy asses and get your own food." u'Food was very bad. Owner attitude was even more worsed. I would not go there again and would not recommend anybodyto go there.'],-0.2755,0.0,0.839,0.161
76.Le Bernardin,[u"Often highlighted as the pinnacle of seafood cuisine Le Bernardin is an establishment that requires no introduction. From the impeccable interior decor to the painstakingly meticulous dishes Eric Ripert has managed to create an experience that is memorable delightful and well worth the cost. I took my parents here to celebrate a joint Mother's / Father's Day and they still talk about it to this day.\n\nI don't think it's quite necessary to go too into detail about the food - the menus speak for themselves and each course was a dazzling display of the sheer mastery of the kitchen. Complementing flavors were prevalent throughout the meal and the slow transition from sea to land of the Chef's Tasting was quite the culinary journey that you'd only be able to understand after trying. Although I'm sure the Le Bernardin Tasting has its merits should I find myself here again I'd probably go for the Chef's menu once more.\n\nAbove all I wanted to hone in on what tied everything together and made the event that much more memorable - the service. Some may argue that it's to be expected from a three-star restaurant but the staff went above and beyond with every request we had in addition to being extremely accommodating when I needed to step out for a substantial amount of time. My parents and I never felt rushed through the meal and even in the admittedly pompous atmosphere we were all comfortable and tended to flawlessly.\n\nOverall as much as I enjoyed the food I do think there were courses that were a bit too much especially towards the end of the tasting. Realistically however this was probably due to a mismatch of my own tastes with some of the sauces that were used in some of the dishes which isn't anything I can fault the restaurant for (and my parents loved every dish!). All things considered Le Bernardin successfully proved - and will undoubtedly prove - why they deserve to be rated one of the best restaurants in the world time and time again." u'What I\'m measuring it against: fine-dining restaurants in major cities.\n\nComing here for the first time is like watching Citizen Kane for the first time--you struggle to tune out all the praise and "look-at-me-I-think-differently" criticisms and simply try to enjoy the place on its own merits and form your own opinion about it. That said Le Bernardin delivers what you would expect from a place as written about as it is.\n\nService...As you would expect just about perfect. When I say that I\'m including the reservation process follow-up calls days prior to coming to NYC and the two phone calls placed the day of because I had to delay the dinner start. Special accommodations also made for dessert. Again what you would expect from a place like this...\n\nFood...Went for the full tasting menu (some wine by the glass). Also had a great gin/raspberry cocktail at the bar to start with at 10pm. No setbacks with regards to pacing. Most courses come with a broth poured over. So how much food? Well I had a pie from Lombardi\'s at about 1pm that day and I intentionally didn\'t eat after that since I knew what kind of dinner was coming my way. That said courses were satisfying without being overwhelming. So what\'s the food like? Fish cooked in a minimalist way but paired with flavorful sauces/broths (yes very oversimplified generalization...I know). \n\nWould I change anything? Yes but my complaints are largely superficial. The food here is special and I wish the d\xe9cor could match it. I like darker colors and dimmer lights and this place features lighter woods and brighter (but not bright) lights (my ideal setting would be this menu served in the lower level of Chicago\'s Gilt Bar). I will say this--the large "ocean waves" art piece and plates (the ones that look like ocean droplets are on them) are beautiful in person. I also wish the place was smaller with more intimacy but given the demand and reputation of this place its larger space makes more sense from a business standpoint. Lastly the repetitive electronic music played could be replaced by Coltrane Monk etc. Nevertheless the three stars from that one tire company and all the other praise uttered over the years appears to be warranted...' u"Beautiful restaurant right in the heart of midtown.  There are 2 set menus in a very affordable $200-$300 price range.  We opted for the 4 course $175 menu as you have the opportunity to chose the apps entree's and desserts you want.  \n\nOff course with any fine dining jacket required restaurant you start off with your amuse which included a pickled radish cube of raw tuna and crab.  For our app the both of us chose raw oysters.  For my secondi I had the langoustines and the wife had the crab cakes.  For the main entrees I had the white tuna and wagyu and she had the skate.  We ended with deconstructed black Forrest cake and a grill corn dessert.\n\nThe ask with All fine dining restaurants was on point.  You usually have 4-5 people attending to you.  Your main server secondary the water guy the bread guy and your busser.\n\nThe food was all fresh and tasted delicious.  My grilled white tuna was my stand out dish.  Being from Hawaii we hardly eat cooked tuna.  But this was exceptionally tasty and perfectly cook.  For\nmy wife she love skate any which way so that was her highlight.  For $175 this was a great deal for a Michelin starred establishment." u"Le Bernardin was amazing! My first time to a 3 star Michelin Restaurant and it didn't not disappoint me at all. From start to finish this place was great! The service was excellent and the food was delicious.\n\nMy three favorite dishes were: scallop with dashi lobster ravioli with truffle butter and the s'mores cake.\n\nAll I can say if you are a foodie and like seafood you must try the food here. Come for lunch for a cheaper menu but still the high quality of food." u"One of my favorite dining experiences ever. Came here on a Tuesday evening for my roommate's birthday. The restaurant look is classic fine dining but the menu is innovative and absolutely delicious. The service was amazing as it should be at a three Michelin-starred restaurant.  \n\nI really appreciate that they have several dining options instead of only one tasting menu. We chose the 4 course prix-fixe for $157. This is the cheapest option but extremely reasonable in my opinion especially for a three Michelin star restaurant. We liked this menu because we got to choose every dish we had. \n\nNow on to the actual food. The amuse bouche was delicious and fresh. Don't come here if you aren't a huge fan of seafood because it's in basically every dish and showcased wonderfully. My friend has both a nut and shellfish allergy and they took care to make sure her amuse bouche was customized with the lobster replaced with something else. For my first course I got the geo-duck. I've never tried this before but have heard of it and really enjoyed it! Great portion size and refreshing a flavorful. For my second course I had the most AMAZING LOBSTER WITH TRUFFLE TAGLIATELLE. Can you think of a more perfect dish because I can't? It included a whole lobster tail and the most melt in your mouth fragrant pasta. I would have this everyday. \n\nFor my entree I got the monkfish with a squid ink Asia noodle underneath. Once again very tasty super unique and great portion size. I was stuffed! My roommate got the wagyu beef that is one of he only non-seafood entrees but also comes with a fish. Hers was tuna and it also looked fantastic. I was slightly jealous of her red meat and getting the best of both worlds.  \n\nFinally for dessert she chose the coconut dessert and I got the cheese plate ($32 supplement but so worth it.) They bring out a whole cheese cart and I got to choose each of my 4 cheeses asking questions about the taste and origins of all the options. The waiter also brought out a fabulous chocolate dessert with a candle for my roommate's birthday which was perfect having the chocolate dessert and the cheese option. \n\nWe could hardly finish it all but at the end they brought out the most lovely petite fours including various gummies chocolate tart cake and a macaron that perfectly topped off the entire meal. Once again they were conscious of replacing my roommate's selection with desserts free of nuts. \n\nSuch a memorable night and dining experience. Would love to come back and share with others. This is what fine dining is all about!!" u'Thinking back about our meal. All I can do is sigh. I can see why they are one of the top 20 restaurants in the world. \n\nWe made our reservations the day reservations opened. Which I believe was 2-3 months before. They only had one spot left 11:00 pm. HA! I\'ll take it! \n\nWe arrived 30 minutes too early so we checked our coats and headed to the bar. The bartender  moved in fluid movements and the cocktails she made were amazing. Our table was ready and we headed to the dining room. \n\nEven at 11:00pm the dining room was packed. Not an empty table. Vibe was generally quiet but you could tell everyone was enjoying their meals.\n\nWe chose the Chef\'s Tasting menu  $225 per person ( I always ask for a menu for the table so I know what I\'m eating when the entrees come out ) \n\nCAVIAR TARTARE -Filet Mignon-Kampachi-Osetra Caviar Tartare; Lightly Smoked Dashi Gel\xe9e\nKrug Grande Cuv\xe9e 163rd Edition France NV\n\nCRAB - Dungeness "Crab Cake;" Old Bay Crisp Shellfish-Cardamom Emulsion\nSaint-Joseph Circa J.L.

A must try.' u'I was super excited for my visit for Le Bernardin especially seeing Eric Ripert on various TV shows and liking his personality and story. My friend called in June to secure a 7:30 reservation in July so we waited a long time to dine there.\n\nFor a three-star Michelin restaurant I expected perfection in both food and service but I thought flaws existed for both. When we sat down we had to wait before someone came to explain the menu. Different people rotated in and out without any introduction and I had no idea who our captain was. Also plates were delivered at weird times; there were long waits and many times my friend\'s plate arrived before mine or we had to wait a few minutes for the sauce to come out. I just found all of that very odd because timing is supposedly to important in fine dining restaurants. I also had to flag someone to fill my water. \n\nThat being said everyone was very nice and I didn\'t feel a snooty vibe from the restaurant at all. I felt welcomed the whole time but for the high prices the details matter.\n\nNow for food for a seafood restaurant I thought that the dishes were just OK. The complimentary oysters tasted a little fishy. The striped bass also tasted rough and flavorless. I was expected to be surprised with the food but everything was just "good."\n\nI don\'t know if my expectations were too high but I\'ve had better seafood at other French restaurants in NYC. Maybe the tasting menu is better...' u'I was most blown away by the extensive bread selection - never seen so many options for a meal. The overall experience was worth the price and definitely would be in the market to make a return trip.\n\nDid the prix-fixe lounge meal and were impressed every step of the way. From the professionalism by the staff to the interior to quality of the ingredients and the display of the food on the table. I had the Salmon while my wife had the Skate.' u"I've been to Le Bernardin twice - in 2014 and 2017 - and honestly the menu did not change much besides a few seasonal tweaks.  The lack of menu revision is in part why I was hesitant to come back but it was my sister's birthday we were in the mood for a swanky dinner and she doesn't eat meat so a reservation was secured and the return to Le Bernardin was set.\n\nFirst a brief recap of my 2014 visit: We had the Chef's Tasting and while it certainly was good not many of the 8 dishes stood out.  There was an exquisitely cooked langoustine and the white tuna/wagyu course was excellent.  Two of the courses (including the langoustine) had a thin slice of truffle slapped on top of them and the truffle aroma was strong and enticing; however upon sampling the actual truffle slice we realized it had zero flavour.  I assume Le Bernardin must use truffle oil or salt to enhance the flavour profile which in my opinion is a bit shady and evidences how high end restaurants sometimes use showy ingredients at the expense of the dish.  The langoustine would have been just as perfectly cooked and tasty without the added flourish and that to me is a sign of a better chef/restaurant.  We found the service to be a bit dismissive and cold during our visit.  It was the kind of service where you feel like you're inconveniencing the staff the entire time.  Instead of sounding excited about the dish descriptions the staff drawled them out with no enthusiasm and immediately scampered away when they were finished.  Bottom line: you should not be treated as if you don't exist at a 3 Michelin star restaurant - you should be treated like the Queen of England - and that did not happen at Le Bernardin.\n\nMoving on to 2017: We had an 8 PM reservation on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was packed.  We started with some excellent cocktails followed by a nice crisp Gr\xfcner from Austria.  I spotted Aldo Sohm roaming the dining room but unfortunately he was not our sommelier :( We opted for the four-course pre-fixe so we could satisfy our respective tastes.  For my almost raw course I had the kampachi tartare served in a citrus sauce and loved it.  Second up for the barely touched course I had the langoustine and my sister had the octopus.  Both were outstanding.  For the main course I had the white tuna/wagyu again and my sister had the halibut.  While the quality of the fish/meat is undeniable the preparation is just kind of boring.  We both found that our fish was pretty bland and the accompaniments did nothing to add to the dishes.  The desserts were definitely a highlight: from the pre-fixe selections to the birthday cake and finally the petit fours each bite was exciting and delicious.  One more thing the bread basket at Le Bernardin is a serious carb heaven with 6 or 7 selections each more intriguing than the last.  I usually limit my bread intake at restaurants because I don't want to get unnecessarily filled up but I think I had 4 or 5 pieces here.  \n\nThis review is probably more like 4.25 stars (4 for 2014 and 4.5 for 2017) because although I felt the food was only slightly better than my last visit the 2017 service outshone the 2014 service by leaps and bounds.  The servers were way more enthusiastic engaging and attentive.  The bread server piled my plate with 2 selections at a time without batting an eye and did not act inconvenienced when I kept inquiring about the different choices (soooo many).  I'm so glad Le Bernardin is stepping up on the service and I think with a little menu revamp it could be a solid 5-stars." u"Just amazing--food service ambience all were perfection.  We walked in on a Thursday night and easily got a table near the bar.  \n\nI loved everything we tried--the wine menu the ceviche and the apple dessert.  The ceviche was so fresh and the apple dessert was so cool: it looks like a mini apple when it arrives but it's actually a concoction of cake mousse etc. that is divine.\n\nAnd service was top notch--even though we were technically seated in the bar area service was still flawless." u"Wowzer! This place does not kid around!  However please be aware that Chef Eric does not work on Saturday =(. \n\nI reserved this spot for an anniversary dinner for my wife and we opted for the $225 chef tasting menu as well as wine tasting for one ($370 pp). In short if you've come to any Michelin 3's the service is very comparable to some of the major players: i.e. impeccable service (I clocked 14.75 seconds for water refill) amazing mouth-orgasm food well-informed and polite sommeliers secret hidden dessert items as well as a post-meal food indulgence coma. My only suggestion is that at the beginning of the dinner I had asked politely whether we can use flash photography and were given permission. However after just one picture another waiter stopped by and gently reminded us that we were not allowed to do such a thing...made us kinda feel bad and uncultured (which...well I understand flash photography is a no-no at fine dining places). As for the food well I'm sure the menus will change but our meal was primarily fish-heavy but oh that wagyu beef...oh my god I've never eaten anything so delicious and unparalleled in my entire life. The fish dishes were all cooked to absolute tender perfection and I particularly enjoyed the gentle dressing of each dish with the previously painstakingly prepared sauces. At the end of the dinner our waitress brought us to the back of the restaurant (upon request) and showed us around the different areas of the kitchen and introduced us to the sous chef which was nice.\n\nMy recommendations well it's a Michelin 3 which means that visiting this place deserves a trip all by itself." u"Le Bernardin is an exceptional dining experience.  It's a great atmosphere although it is an open dining area it still feels intimate.  The staff pays attention to every detail and are extremely accommodating.  The food is amazing and fresh.  The lobster and scallops were my favorite but I enjoyed every dish on the tasting menu." u'Every dish was cooked perfectly and I wish I could come back for more. We had lunch here but decided to treat our gluttonous selves and have the Le Bernardin tasting menu. The menu they give you for lunch is identical to dinner for the tasting menus. The fish here is cooked to perfection. The only dish that didn\'t wow me was the fluke. I have to say my favorite dish was the monk fish with squid ink pasta. The service here was great and we were able to crack jokes with the waiters. I didn\'t even really want the dessert part of the tasting menu but when it came I was very happy and finished all of it. There are two spectacular dishes for dessert that I wish I had in my hands right now! \n\nFrom their website:\n\nLE BERNARDIN TASTING\nLe Bernardin Tasting -$185 per person - $280 with wine pairing per person\nFLUKE\nFluke-Enoki Mushroom "Spring Roll;" Junmai-Shiso Infused Tomato Water\nSauvignon Blanc "les blanchais" Domaine Pelle Menetou-Salon Loire France 2014\nLANGOUSTINE\nSeared Langoustine; Fennel Mousseline Spiced Citrus-Sambal Sauce\nPetite Arvine Vigne Rovettaz Grosjean Fr\xe8res Vall\xe9e d\'Aoste Italy 2015\nSNAPPER\nCrusted Red Snapper; Spiced Persian Cucumbers White Balsamic-Anticucho Sauce\nChardonnay "Puerta del Mar" The Ojai Vineyard Santa Barbara County California 2015\nMONKFISH\nPan Roasted Monkfish; Squid Ink Fideos Chorizo Emulsion\nDomaine de L\'Hortus Grande Cuv\xe9e Pic-Saint-Loup Languedoc France 2014\nSTRIPED BASS\nBaked Striped Bass; Spaghetti Squash and Green Papaya Salad Ginger-Red Wine Sauce\nSankt Laurent Rosi Schuster Burgenland Austria 2015\nRASPBERRY\nMacerated Raspberries Preserved Lychee Jasmine Ice Cream\nRoyal Tokaji Late Harvest Hungary 2015\n"BLACK FOREST"\nBrandied Cherries Whipped Vanilla Cream Chocolate Sorbet\nBeerenauslese Alois Kracher Burgenland Austria 2015\n-\ntasting menus are per table only' u"This review is so so hard for me to write and admit I had an underwhelming experience at Le Bernardin. I've wanted to come here for years and finally experienced the four course prix fixe dinner. \n\nI enjoyed the Almost Raw - Tuna and Barely Touched - Lobster but the Lightly Cooked - Snapper fell short for me because of the sauce. The strawberry dessert was fun (crack open a white chocolate sphere) but was too sour for me. \n\nService was lovely and attentive. However at the price point I'm not sure I would come back for the food. Still glad to have tried out Le Bernardin once!" u"Excellent service and delicious food that's pleasantly plated.\n\nHad the tasting menu with wine pairing and it was excellent I believe it was 8-9 courses but to be honest I was so tipsy from all the wine I can't remember ;) No complaints here.\n\nBill came to about 1000 for two people but with tip it was a little over 1200. Would recommend and will return again. Loved it." u'Wow just wow.\n\nLoved our dinner at Le Bernardin  I knew I was in for a special meal (and a wallop to our wallet) but I\'ve been a fan of Eric Ripert forever so I wanted to come here as soon as I found out I\'d be in NY.\n\nWe had the chef\'s tasting menu with wine pairing and I thought it was seriously one of the best meals I\'ve ever had.  I do think personal preference is a factor since there are people that appreciate things that I don\'t and vice versa.\n\nThe reason why I thought Le Bernardin was better than other chef\'s tasting menu at various high end restaurants:\n\n- Each dish was true to its flavors.  Meaning I didn\'t find any dish to be over the top in its combination of ingredients and flavors.  Some places seem to try to be so creative that I find the dishes to be pointless and scattered.  Kind of like a dab of sauce at one end of the plate and various array of different flavors at the other end of the dish.  I\'m just not into that kind of "creativity" when it comes to food new flavors I like but certain flavors that seem to be mixed out of nowhere?  Not a fan.\n- The dishes incorporated a lot of broth/sauce that was poured at the table and I really like that.  It might be the asian in me but I love some good full of depth broth and some of the broth that was used in the dishes were amazing.  It totally enhanced the seafood dishes for me.\n- I love seafood and this place emphasizes true seafood.  There are some seafood that tastes like fish.  For example when it comes to sushi I love mackerel or aji.  A lot of Japanese people do but a lot of people seem to think anything "fishy" is bad.  Actually some fish is supposed to taste a little "fishy" but not in the going bad way but because that is the true flavor of the fish.  It\'s a little nuance that I think is lost very often and I found that Le Bernardin dishes had that for me.  It\'s hard to explain but I loved it.  \n- Every dish was amazing for me but if I had to pick black bass was my least favorite and the caviar tartare and white tuna-japanese wagyu were my two favorites.  So good.\n- Wine pairing was wonderful.  Each wine was delicious and totally enhanced the food as it should.  Worth it.\n- Chef\'s tasting menu was 8 courses but there was also amuse bouche to start the meal and extra dessert platter at the end so it was more like 10 courses.  They even threw in an extra dessert for us since we were celebrating my upcoming birthday.\n\nI did find it a little odd that different servers seemed to rotate through the course of our meal.  Even different sommeliers for our wine pourings.  But they were all very nice and friendly I didn\'t get any of that snootiness that you get at fancy restaurants sometimes.\n\nThis was one of the rare chef\'s tasting dinners that made both my husband and I sad when it was over.  Usually my husband can\'t handle 2-3 hours of sitting and eating and gets antsy at even some of the best restaurants.  But here he was sad when the dinner came to an end.  That says a lot trust me!\n\ntip: Jackets are required for men in the dining room.  If you call ahead they will loan you a jacket (as we were travelling and didn\'t bring one).  The jacket they lent my husband was super nice and looked really good.  Probably nicer than the one he has at home lol.\nWomen were all dressed really nice lots of dresses or at least skirts and nice tops.  I find NY dressier than LA overall and it certainly was reflected here.\n\nBest meal ever!  Very impressed.' u'Service was amazing! I ordered the octopus and halibut. The presentation of both were outstanding! The food itself was good but it was more my personal selection than the food that I was unsatisfied with. My first time in a French restaurant so I wish I had taken more time to really choose my selections. My bday dessert was the best part.' u'After reading and knowing about Chef Eric Ripert I was very lucky to get reservations at Le Bernadin. I had such a wonderful experience here and it was one of the most memorable moments of my New York trip. The ambiance was very classy and modern. I ordered the chef tasting menu and everything was superb and each course was so unique and tasty! My favorites were the caviar tartare and lobster tagliatelle. Furthermore service was exceptional! This was an unforgettable experience and Le Bernadin truly deserves to be a 3 star Michelin restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant and would come back here in a heartbeat!' u"Awesome place. Great food excellent service. Not 5 star though although it was very very good. \n\nWe had the set menu and a great bottle of oregon pinot. Service was 5 stars the guys were very responsive and the sommelier Cameron was fantastic. \n\nThe thing that brought the food down and I am not a global food critic by any stretch was the main dish. My wife had the lobster which at best was good crab meat. I had the lamb which was quite tough and chewy. That's fine was a great night but if you are paying $200 pp (300 inc wine tip and tax) it should fall apart. It didn't and therefore it couldn't get to 5 stars and on top of that I would expect a lot of Australian restaurants to get 3 star Michelin rating pretty easily. Because this has 3 stars and it wasnt up to that standard. \n\nWould definitely go back and reccomend though. Great place. Definitely." u"The service was amazing. The servers were friendly and very aware of when we needed service. The food was hit or miss for me. I thought the lobster tail was amazing. The monkfish was also pretty tasting; however the noodles they served with it was overly salty. I got the fig for desert which I also found to be a little too sweet for my liking. All in all I thought the food didn't live up to the hype. It was good but for the price and reputation behind it I was expecting more."],0.2382,0.13,0.87,0.0
102.Lilly’s Craft and Kitchen,[u'Great good great service great prices!\n\nI got a veggie omelette and the bottomless brunch and spent about $40 a good deal for Midtown. They were great about taking our 9 person reservation and were cool when two people were late. Overall a great brunch spot highly recommend!!' u"Good stop in for a few drinks and apps before a Ranger game.  Warm casual gastro pub feel.  Nice selection of craft beers on draft that covered all styles.   Very good quick service and I was cheerily offered samples of the beers I was considering.  I had a DuClaw's Dirty Little Freak - a really nice chocolate and coconut brown ale.  Draft system was spot on - beer was fresh and temp perfect.  \n\nWe ordered 3 apps to share - nachos poutine and cheeseburger burritos.  All were very good - nice take on the poutine - fries topped with pulled short rib fontina cheese and Guinness brown sauce.  Fries were cooked perfectly - nice and crispy but not overdone making it easier to scoop the goodness of the short rib.  Nachos were topped with beef fresh jalape\xf1os salsa and cheese - very flavorful.  We weren't sure about what to order for our third and the cheeseburger burritos were at the advice of our server - they did not disappoint - beef lettuce onion and a spicy mayo in a wrap - excellent.  \n\nA very good stop - good food good beer selection and good service.  Adding it to my list of pre-MSG places to stop - far enough away from all the awful tourist spots that surround the Garden - but an easy 10-15 minutes walk down depending on your pace." u'We made a reservation 10 days ago arrived early and were asked to wait.  We waited until our 1pm reservation and the people we were supposed to replace stayed at their table until 1:20.  The hostess "tried to help" by speeding up the process even after we explained that we needed to be out by 2:30 for a show.  \n\nWe left and went to another restaurant with no eait and couldn\'t have been more accommodating. Stay away they don\'t care about their customers who actually take time to make a reservation. \n\nWe won\'t be coming back.' u"Decided to try Lilly's from reviews....so glad we did!\nOur group of 7 was absolutely thrilled that I booked our brunch here. The menu is extensive and can definitely please most ...and the $20 unlimited cocktails is a perfect compliment! Our server Stephanie was so gracious and helpful the entire time! And we must thank Peter for his attentiveness! I'm telling all my friends and even strangers to try Lilly's!!!!!" u"Came here on a Saturday for brunch/late lunch. It was probably around 2pm or so but they still had the brunch menu (available until 4pm) and the 90 min unlimited mimosa/Bellini/Bloody Mary/screwdriver. \n\nOf course my friend and I went for the 90 minute. Just fair warning all drinks were on the sweeter side but creeped up to you after you've had 5 or 6 (side note: we came in with empty stomachs). I tried each drink and my recommendation if I had to choose was mimosa or screwdriver. Not the best but I'll take it. Also we didn't mark our time to when we started our 90 minute so we asked our server and she just told us we can go until 4pm. \n\nOur server was the sweetest person ever. Attentive and super nice. I can say I liked the place because she made the experience worthwhile. \n\nI ordered the breakfast quesadilla. Nothing special. Maybe their other menu items from their regular menu is better?" u'Long bar on the right plus maybe a dozen high tops.  20 taps with  good selection of craft beers no Bud no Coors no Miller.\n\nMusic is something modern - not loud.\n\nBartender was professional friendly.\n\nI was there for lunch  the fish and chips were just OK not a bargain at $19.00.  A Firestone  IPA was $8.00 for 12 oz.\n\nNice enough but out of the way for me.' u'Honestly probably the worst culinary experience I\'ve had in years which is saying a lot.\n\nStopped by with some friends around 1:15 AM (kitchen closes at 2 AM) for some bites and beer. Service was friendly and the waitress was great. Water was refilled quickly and beer came out fast. The house pilsner was pretty meh but whatever.\n\nWe ordered the poutine lobster truffle mac and cheese and the chef\'s burger. Which took an hour to come out.\n\nThe poutine was probably the most acceptable out of the three but they used a British gravy on it which left everything soggy. The braised beef was decent though. Not enough cheese curds.\n\nThe "lobster truffle" mac and cheese had neither of these things. They put (frozen!) crawfish tails into sour-tasting watery mac and cheese that was worse than any boxed variety you could get. When I asked them if a mistake was made the kitchen told us that it was lobster. I was not drunk nor could I be drunk enough to mistake crawfish from lobster. It honestly tasted terrible and I didn\'t even want to eat it. They took it off the bill which is fine but that\'s really not the point. Don\'t give me that BS.\n\nThe burger was over-cooked as heck dry and disgusting.\n\nDon\'t go here.' u'VERY GOOD burger and they offer fried pickles as add-on. \nHappy hours during the week from 11am to 8pm: $5 for a glass of wine or beer. \nWaiter is very nice. \nPlace is very nice and not very busy at lunch so come and enjoy your burger!!' u"This is a very nice tavern space  with excellent drinks and good specials in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.  \n\nThe food I found a bit variable but mostly very solid with a modern pub food orientation. \n\nThe kitchen is open most nights to 2am and we found the brunch menu classic and simple. Benedict's Omelettes and French Toast are the core of the brunch scene here. For $20 you can drink a select set of drinks for 90 minutes that's a good way to start a lazy Sunday.\n\nOne misstep is  it can get hot in here the ceiling fans don't get it done so sit next to the street. \n\nGood things on the menu are mac n cheese with lobster and the Benedict's were solid but could have used a piece of fruit. My Chefs Burger with all its eclectic desires resulted in a confused palate  but chorizo and lobster inside chopped meat is a stretch. The prep on the burger was A+ though. \n\nBest things here are ambience  the efficient service  a nice clientele  and a very solid drinks menu with great beer selection  and bartender execution as well. \n\nKitchen is 3.5 star.\n\nOverall this place is classic west end with great tunes  and overflowing with that great New York bar scene. I love it." u'We tried the place for brunch and the experience was OK. The table and chair where we were seated was dirty and had a strong bathroom perfume smell. I ordered the salmon benedict - the egg was warm but the toasted english muffin was very cold. The potato wedges were delicious. My husband got the quesadilla which was very hot and tasty. We felt rushed out when the hostess asked us leave our seats right after we had finished eating to get new customers seated. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Was an OK experience but would not rush back there.' u"Please don't waste your time. The service will be absurdly terrible the food will take forever. The food wasn't even good and I got wings now difficult are those. The house IPA was literally just bitter and no other flavor. With thousands of places in hell's kitchen to go please just keep walking by. I'm not usually a hard or difficult person but place isn't doing things well.\n\nSide note dozen wings means 12 not 9 but I guess who's counting?" u"So much disappointment. We came on Friday night for dinner took forever to place the order. Our burgers came cold patties were way overcooked (medium well instead of medium rare) and they're literally were falling apart. They also included tips however there were 5 of us not 6 how it said on the menu.\nUsually I'd call for a manager in this case but we're in a rush and our server knew it. Never coming back wish I could give 0 stars." u"I was just here a few moments ago. I had the burger that's available during brunch - it was a pretty good cheeseburger.  Not the best cheeseburger I've ever had but very good. Loved the fried egg on top and The fries were delicious! My friend ordered the arugula Benedict and he loved it. The service was fine - the server did check up on us a few times. Overall the experience was very good." u'Stopped in for brunch on Saturday before a show. It was shortly after they opened but already very busy. Very fun atmosphere. Great beer selection and good food. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome. Definitely will go back.' u'Terrible service bland food terrible service decent HH prices oh and did I mention terrible service?\n\nDecided to give this place a shot for HH and it\'s awesome prices (which were great btw $5 drinks? hello!) But unfortunately the hostess and the service in general killed our vibe. We walked in around 7pm and HH ended at 8pm.. we were immediately seated which was great but didn\'t get service until 7:30.... yea a little ridiculous. \n\nTo top things off our hostess was just plain nasty. I dont know if she was having a rough day or if that\'s just her attitude in general but she was very rude in taking our order and forgot the order multiple times. As we asked her questions about the menu she wouldn\'t answer properly or very obviously showed she was annoyed. \n\nWe asked one of the other servers if the "drunken potato" on their menu had any meat/bacon in it and he said no so we ordered that when our original server came by. Turns out the drunken potato does have bacon and we told the server we were misinformed and sent it back instead of apologizing about the miscommunication she told us that we shouldve known better..... LOL? It was all a little funny actually but needless to say we wont be returning here!\n\nThe 2 stars are for the CUTE decor and great prices but other than that.. there\'s a bunch of bars in Hell\'s Kitchen take your party elsewhere ;)' u"A good spot not too pricey the $20 all you can drink deal is nice. It's a happening spot so get a reservation. \n\nThe food is pretty good. We had the short rib bene which was tasty and then a few other less memorable dishes... But everything was good no complaints. \n\nThe best part about this place is the servers for sure. They keep on top of you to make sure your drinks are filled everything is good for you etc. We ended up hanging out for a couple hours to take full advantage of the bottomless drinks and they were completely cool with it. \n\nWe will get back there for a relaxed brunch soon." u'Fun a bit noisy but fun and great service with good food and cocktails .

The inside was a typical long and narrow set up as many restaurants in the city. It had a really nice looong bar with bar counter and crazy amount of bar stools. They had table seating across from the bar good amount of them.\n\nWe started our brunch with a cup of coffee which came with free refill. It was a good cup of coffee to wake us up and get our stomach ready for some food.\n\nWe ordered Crispy French Toast and The Lilly\'s Breakfast Burger. I somehow thought their French Toast would be small but it was a pretty good portion. It comes with a choice of bacon or sausage and we chose bacon. And my goodness the bacon was amazing! The French Toast was rather interesting. They seemed to be coated with corn flake or something similar creating that crunch. The burger was huge I mean really big! The patty was cooked a bit more than how we requested so it was a bit more on the dry side. I prefer super juicy burger patty but the egg helped some on that part.  The patty was still tasty and flavorful. The veggies were super fresh and buns were soft and airy. Overall it was a good burger.\n\nOur server Shannon was really nice. She was friendly tentative and took a good care of us with a smile. Another cool thing about them was that on the bottom of their drinks and dessert menu it said "5% off food with a Yelp Check-In." Of course we checked in with Yelp and showed it to our server. It only applies to "food" items not drinks. Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl.' u'Had a wonderful brunch with short rib eggs Benedict and sides of fruit and bacon. The atmosphere was casual and it was very easy to get a spot. Sat at the bar facing the street so I could enjoy watching people walking by. \n\nWill absolutely come back again.' u'We stumbled in here on a rainy Saturday night before our Broadway show & i\'m glad we did! \nWe had burgers and the Cajun chicken breast sandwich. They offer a "make your own burger" option starting at $13 where you can add whatever aside from lettuce tomato & onion that you want on top for an additional $1.50. \n\nThe drinks are affordable and the pours are massive. Lilly\'s will get you done for cheap. My giant wine pour totally made my day. \n\nInside is slightly pub-like but a bit nicer. As in you can totally take your parents here when they come into town. \n\nService was here and there. We had drinks and food but they kept trying to take stuff away before we were done-and asked if I needed more wine when I was holding a full glass that I had just got...They also forgot the side sauces we ordered. Despite the minor service issues the food was wonderful. This was one of the best chicken breast sandwiches I have had in a long time. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned & the bread was crispy perfection. The burgers were also stellar. Glad to have this new hangout in Hells Kitchen!'],0.5093,0.292,0.708,0.0
4.Trattoria Trecolori,[u'We had reservations for 8:00 got there around 7:50 and were sat at 8:10. Seemed pretty busy and they were kind about the wait. \nThe downstairs has a bar you can sit at and tables for smaller parties. The upstairs had tables for the larger parties.\nThe staff was very kind and attentive. \nThe food was delicious and filling. The price was reasonable for the quality. \nVery romantic/classy vibe. Great for a date *wink wink*.' u"For being this close to Times Square/Theater district you always wonder if you are going to get caught in some sort of tourist trap...barely above Olive Garden fare.  However when searching for places to eat during a recent work trip the good reviews seemed to point to something a bit better.\n\nHoly moly...glad we took a chance.  We actually almost went to another restaurant but the inside looked much less crowded sometimes an indication that you're not in for something great though I've been fooled.  However this place was somewhat busy but we seemed to find the time where a party of 4 did not have to wait for a table thank goodness.  How to start off a good meal?  Warm marinated olives...hoo boy.  Somehow my dining companions were all not fans of olives at all so they were all mine and I was definitely a happy camper.\n\nFor dinner I agonized over choices.  Go with something new or the familiar?  I had not had carbonara in some time and the last time I got it in a restaurant they botched the execution...I ended up with pasta with scrambled eggs...yuck.  So I kept my fingers crossed and ordered it and this was a much much superior execution.  Rich eggy (but not scrambled) sauce salty pancetta...perfection.\n\nDessert was just as sublime...a co-worker and I decided to split the house made ricotta cheesecake and the cannoli.  The cannoli was simple but very good...crisp shell (which means it hadn't been sitting out forever) and creamy filling.  And the ricotta cheesecake?  Definitely the winner hands down.  What tasted like a touch if citrus wonderfully dense filling no crust to detract from the taste and a smattering of fresh fruit and raspberry sauce...ah-mazing!\n\nAway from the hustle and bustle of crazy Broadway but delicious!" u"[500]\n\nI'm so glad this is my 500th review because we LOVED this place.  Found it via yelp reviews and it was close to our hotel.   So close to Broadway shows.\n\nWe made reservations a few weeks in advance and glad we did because this place gets busy quick.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated with plenty of room between tables. We never felted squished which we do at certain NYC restaurants.\n\nCarlos was our server and he was amazing.  He helped us with so many menu items (changing /splitting specials).   He was very friendly towards my son.  Answered tons of questions.\n\nKid had chicken fingers and French fries.  It was so tasty.  You can see the chicken fingers were freshly made and no frozen crap.\n\nWe had a caprese appetizer split in half and it was amazing.  You can taste the freshness in the cheese.\n\nWe also had a dinner special split to have as an appetizer.  Saffron fettuccine.  Shrimp crab meat and cherry tomatoes. Loved it. Hubby's half had broccoli rabe.  You can taste the freshness of the pasta.  I ate every bite.\n\nI had jumbo shrimp w/ risotto in a wine sauce.  The shrimp were HUGE!!  I love every bite. I saved half for the hotel and ate it the same evening.\n\nWe didn't have dessert since we were full.\n\nThis is definitely our new NYC restaurant.    \n\nHopefully they will join OpenTable one day :) \n\nWe will definitely be back." u"Arrived promptly for dinner reservations Friday 10/6/16 at 5:30. It is a nice place and we were seated downstairs decor very nice but a bit warm. Our server greeted us promptly. The place was fairly slow. The special of the day was lasagna and my friend had pasta with vegetables. She ordered a bottle of wine since it was her birthday; $48 for the bottle.  My lasagna was okay not worth the $24. I was expecting a rich authentic flavor. It had large pieces of Italian sausage as if they had been into the dish as an after thought. Bread was a bit hard and served with butter too cold to spread. The free olives were a nice touch.  We split a cheesecake whatever their version was; it was so forgettable I don't remember what they called it.  My advice skip this place for the price you can eat at Bucca de Beppo and get better food.\n\nAtmosphere 4.5\nService 5\nFood 3" u"Good food and decent price and drinks too. Dessert wasn't all that great so I won't recommend desserts at all but their main dishes like pastas are very nice! Friendly staffs although not as attentive even though there's quite a few walking around at all times. Still nice service and I would go again for lunch maybe dinner. Walking distance to a few different subway stations since it's in Times Square so it's very convenient and not too hard to find either!" u"My mom and I came here after seeing Waitress (phenomenal show btw) on a Wednesday for the matinee. We managed to get there quickly enough after the show let out to get spots at the bar for dinner. The dining room was completely booked with reservations so if you have a large group or want to make sure you get a table call ahead.\n\nThe bartenders were very attentive and helpful. They recommended the lasagna of the day and I'm so happy I took their recommendation. It was sweet Italian sausage and ground veal with house made pasta. Delicious. They also recommended a wine to compliment the lasagna which was also great.\n\nFor NYC the price was incredibly reasonable which is always a plus. Definitely recommend!" u"Do not order seafood pasta I didn't know they would serve with lobster that was not fresh. The pasta taste ok but the fact they add the lobster as a ingredient I expect it to be fresh as the sauce pasta clam and mussels." u"We came on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy. Our waiter was somewhat attentive. He quickly gave us the menu and shortly after some water and complimentary bread. Service was good considering it was pretty busy. \n\nI didn't expect anything 'cause my bf picked this place since I was craving Italian. I ordered risotto with shrimp that had some kind of wine sauce. My bf ordered a gnocchi with white sauce. Both our dishes were just okay. The shrimp and the sauce was delicious but the risotto was extremely hard and tasted like it wasn't cooked enough. Disappointed at that. My bf's dish was so simple and it cost a lot. We could have made that on our own. He wasn't happy at all. The foods didn't get us stuffed at all. We still a bit hungry after finishing our dinner. \n\nOverall experience was just okay. A little too expensive for just okay food. Wouldn't be coming back considering there are a lot of other Italian restaurants in NYC." u"We came here on a Saturday around 7. The place was busy but for a table of two we didn't have to wait. Our waiter was attentive and quickly gave us the menus water and their bread. The service here was good considering how busy they were. \n\nI had the gnocchi with tomato sauce eggplant and basil. I didn't like that the gnocchi was not soft and tender as I've had at other Italian restaurants. It felt a little hard to be honest. The sauce and the basil were fresh. But I didn't really care for the eggplant. My bf had the fettuccine with Alfredo sauce and said his dish was satisfactory. But again nothing extraordinary. \n\nOverall it was alright. But I wouldn't come back here again considering there are so many other better Italian options in NYC." u"Pretty good but also quite expensive!\n\nI liked that they had the squid ink pasta dish which was not easy to find at a random Italian restaurant (for example Eataly didn't serve this pasta dish).\n\nMy friend and I did a walk-in so we had to sit at the bar. We ordered the squid ink pasta (LINGUINE NERE ALLA MONSIGNORE) the Veal Sorentino and the GAMBERONI DELLO CHEF (jumbo shrimp risotto).\n\nThe highlight of the dinner was the squid ink pasta. The pasta came with a variety of seafood (clams jumbo shrimp squid scallops). The seafood wasn't the freshest but the sauce and noodles were great! Thanks to the squid ink the pasta noodles came with a hint of saltiness of the sea but the saltiness wasn't overwhelming but was sweetened down by the garlicky buttery sauce. It was a great blend! \n\nThe risotto was good too. The rice was nutty (big oval white rice)  and the sauce was very creamy. The taste overall was pretty balanced not too overwhelmingly creamy or fatty at all. Definitely a good dish. The shrimp was good too!\n\nThe veal in the sorentino dish was super tender. Veal sorentino has a layer of veal steak a layer of eggplant and a  layer of cheese. I liked it but not as much as the 2 former dishes. . Veal sorentino in general just wasn't me and my friend's favorite dish. We felt like it didn't convey the Italian culinary as much as the pastas and risottos.\n\nAnyways for 3 dishes it came out pretty expensive - $100 including everything. \n\nNOTE: Tips were auto-charged but they still had a section in the bill for you to enter more tips. They were considerate enough to let us know about the auto-included tips though." u"I came here with Boo and her bestie and bestie's fiance for lunch. We were near the diamond district and yelp lead us here for decent Italian food. We shared shared meat and cheese antipasti. I had to eat all of the cheese because they did not want it. I liked the pecerino more than what I believed was the provolone. I wished there was more salumi though. Boo Boo housed it. I got the soup of the day which was a seafood soup. It was really good. It tasted like thin mussel a tomato sauce with chucks of fish. I got the seafood pasta with squid ink pasta. \nEveyone stuffed themselved with the warm bread and butter while we were waiting. I was able to finish my plate because I didn't know when my next meal was. Service was great because we were there fro 2-3pm. It was an off hour and I noticed the staff their Linner." u'Started out with a group of five to check out Carmines but the wait was very long for five people   Vs. 4 people.  I decided to find another spot nearby and came across Traytoria Trecolori on Yelp and sat at the bar.  The staff was warm and welcoming even when I called to check on availability.  I could even watch a game at the bar :). Caesar salad was just right and I was moved to try the chicken parmigiana because of a picture I saw on Yelp and it was delish.  Price was right!  Food was good !  Service was great !  Will be on my list for ny and theater visits ...' u"I went here for dinner tonight with a friend around 5pm. We didn't have a reservation so all the seats were full. We were able to be seated directly though in the front seating which was great since I was starving! \n\nStarted off appetizers with the Fritto Misto which was so tasty. The shrimp and red pepper were definitely the best part. I also liked how all of the calamari was fried. For the main dish we decided to share the Penne Arribiatta. I was a bit disappointed that it tasted just like pasta + tomato sauce. There was nothing so special about the flavor and it may just be because that is what the dish was. However if I'm paying the price of this dish from an Italian place I'd expect higher standards for the flavor profile. For dessert I went with the Taratufo Icecream. I probably wouldn't get this dessert again. It felt just like ice cream I'd get from a freezer box. \n\nThat being said appetizer was definitely a 10/10 for me. The server was amazing and quick to address our needs! I would definitely want to go back with a reservation for better seating and try a different pasta dish. The only thing that sucks about front seating is there is less privacy and you could overhear conversations of those sitting next to you." u"Had a lovely meal here. Everyone and everything was great. Monica was absolutely lovely and took good care of us. She was sweet and attentive. The restaurant itself has a nice modern look. \n\nThe food and drinks were very reasonably priced considering this is NYC. Nice sized portions to ensure you don't leave hungry.\n\nI had the risotto with the jumbo shrimp and sauce. It was delicious. The shrimps had great flavor and I love risotto so much. I would definitely order this again. My mom had risotto with shrimp and scallops and hers was okay. It lacked a little flavor. My dad enjoyed his vealchop. All in all we would come back here again  \n\nDesserts was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my chocolate mousse cake and mom loved her flan. And dad said his cheesecake was very moist." u'We had friends visiting and staying in the Times Square area. We found this spot that was accommodating for children a larger group and had gluten free options.\n\nWe got the Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Rigatoni Focaccia both with gluten free noodles and they were excellent. The noodles had a great taste and were well cooked.' u'Great little Italian. Has pasta fagioli soup and re snapper special. Ample portion and presented well.' u"This place is beautiful! The bread is fantastic and the complimentary marinated olives are simply amazing!! Unfortunately it eas VERY hot inside. I know we are in summer but seemed like the a/c wasn't working. Then we get our entr\xe9 and I thought mine wasn't as great as it smelled. It needed more salt and the shrimp was over cooked. But I have to say that the fresh pasta had a beautiful bite to it. I could've put cheese on my pasta but I don't like to do with seafood. My friends really enjoyed their meals. One of the kids had dinner (the other already had dinner) he enjoyed it. They also had vanilla ice cream served with a biscotti and they loved it! Service was very good!" u'Like most restaurants in New York it is narrow and long.  I suggest eating on the second floor it is quieter not as crowded and more comfortable ~ temperature-wise.  The hostess was very accommodating when we did not want to sit at the first table next to the hostess stand.  Service was very good.  Everything that was ordered was enjoyed.  Any changes or special requests were not an issue.  Dessert was outstanding.  Overall it was a delightful meal.  Make reservations seriously.  Also it is in the Theater District so it is VERY convenient.  There is an elevator if one is not able to walk up the stairs.\nBut like most places in NYC if it has been renovated from its previous life to change its purpose the comfort station situation is severely lacking.  Just be aware of that.\nGreat service great food a very satisfied group.' u"This small cozy Italian restaurant is to die for. Amazing food and affordable. Any dish you choose will amaze you. My favorite dessert is tiramisu so you can trust me I've tried at several different places but The tiramisu at trattoria is simply the best. Their house chianti is simply amazing" u"I booked a work dinner for a group of 15 at Trattoria Trecolori with no issues at all.  It's very convenient for large groups especially on the weekdays as they have two stories with plenty of space.  The communication of the staff up to our arrival was great.  \n\nThe space was decent for a group as large as ours though we had to be split into two tables.  We were seated upstairs and I did not feel crowded or claustrophobic at all.  Ambience was nice for a work dinner - I was able to speak without screaming and able to hear people without straining.  Service was interesting - we only had one waiter for all 15 of us and he was also waiting many other tables.  It was rather hard to get his attention the whole evening and I feel like service was slightly lackluster and a bit slow at times.\n\nFor our starters I ordered our tables the caprese salad the mixed (cold) seafood dish and some sort of salad.  Out of those three I would say the only thing you must get is the caprese salad - delicious mozzarella over beefsteak tomatoes and basil.... it's pretty hard to mess this one up.  The mixed seafood salad was decently flavorful.  Pass on the salad.\n\nFor my main entree I got the veal sorrentino which first of all came out almost cold... like a lukewarm temperature.  I like food hot... and this was not it.  Overall it was just a lackluster dish... not sure how to explain it.  The flavor was okay but it could probably have used less cheese and more sauce and probably more accompaniments to go with it.  In retrospect I probably should have gone with a seafood dish.  I also tried my colleague's rack of lamb which lacked flavor and was dry.\n\nFor desserts we got the berries and cream flan and pear gelato.  They were all pretty much average.\n\nA decent spot to hit up if you're looking for a pre-theater meal that isn't going to burn a hole through your pocket but there is definitely way better Italian food in the city if you're looking for a special place."],0.9194,0.251,0.749,0.0
143.Dig Inn,[u"Loved this place!\n\nThe amount you get for about $10 is INSANE!\n\nMy sis and I both got veggie bowls and tried about 6 awesome things sweet potatoes brussel sprouts cabbage....\n\nTotally coming back next time I'm in town!" u'Food: 3.5/5.0\nService: 2.5/5.0\nValue: 3.0/5.0\nDecor: 3.0/5.0\nOverall: 3.5/5.0 \n\nGood healthy food option in Midtown.  Conveniently available for delivery when needed.  Steak and chicken are good meatballs are so so.  They rotate the sides which is nice for variety.  Recommend for sure.' u'It\'s a workers\' lunch place in the area. The line gets really long after 12pm. I went there at 11:50am so there was no line. Food was good but nothing special as other reviewer mentioned. You can choose base two sides and one protein for $10~$13. \nMaybe particular to this location there was no menu displayed obviously. Staff did not explain the system nor menu so it was unclear what options I have. I only got the explanation like "this is tofu" when I asked. I admit the needs of efficiency especially during lunch time but it was not crowded. The lack of explanation would make a first-time customer like me feel unsatisfied. \nI hope it would improve the service.' u'Food is delicious and fresh! I usually get brown rice broccoli grilled sweet potato chicken. Very filling! If you like spicy food ask for their homemade siracha sauce. Really good! \nI usually sit at the bar (3seats) facing the window. Its very busy during lunch time but The line moves pretty fast. I usually come at least once a week.' u'Dig Inn has made me love Brussels Sprouts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThey were delicious! I will definitely be eating them again!\nThank you Dig Inn!! You guys rock! \\o/' u"Checked out Dig Inn after an event in the area on a weekday evening. Don't remember how I heard about this but had it bookmarked and from the reviews I've read was looking forward to a healthy and delicious meal. \n\n- Food: I decided to get the Wild Sockeye Salmon with Toasted Quinoa with Preserved Lemon with sides of Seasonal Upstate Mac with Cauliflower and Red Potatoes with String Beans (~$12). The food and all the options certainly seemed healthy I still managed to make it a bit on the unhealthy side with the Mac and Potatoes but had to do it. \n\nThe food itself wasn't bad but generally it wasn't necessarily delicious and didn't make me excited for another bite. To be honest the Salmon and Potatoes were bland the Mac was decent. If you're looking to eat on the healthier side and just don't want a salad but actual food think this might be the place for you. But if you're looking for a tasty well seasoned meal you can enjoy I would probably skip. \n\n- Atmosphere: The place is fairly tiny so not many places to sit aside from three counter stools. There is a nice small open park area on 55th between 6th and 7th Ave. you can sit down and have a nice relaxing meal at. The staff were also very pleasant and friendly\n\nBottom line good for folks working in the area to get healthy food instead of just salads but for all else is recommend skipping." u"Delicious place to get quality food to go!\n\nCame here during peak lunch hour today for a quick bite. There was a line at the door but it went surprisingly fast. Despite the business the staff were all friendly and accommodating; one female staff member even came out to help direct us through store traffic.  \n\nMenus are positioned on metal clips all along the restaurant line. I'd recommend looking at the menu beforehand as the line tends to go by quickly. \n\nMy tofu salad bowl was absolutely delicious. Each component was seasoned well yet did not overpower other parts of my plate. I got the broccoli and sweet potato sides- both came with huge hunks of veggies that were cooked well. The broccoli had more of an oriental vibe with sesame crunchy crackers and ginger bits while the sweet potatoes were enhanced with sugar and cinnamon. The tofu was refreshingly hard and smoky with pepper and other tangy spices- I was definitely not missing meat after eating my bowl. \n\nOverall an affordable healthy and filling option in the midtown area. I'll definitely be back!" u"I used to come here ALL THE TIME. Even when I didn't live in the city anymore when I would visit Dig Inn was a pit stop. I might still have the stamp card! I love that there are plenty of options and the food is always fresh and of high quality. You can get your food quickly it seems like it's never packed and it's very clean! I feel like I'm eating at a farm store when I'm there. The prices are decent. I always come here if I'm going to MoMA. Highly recommend." u"Dig Inn is a great option when you want some clean eating. With lots of options that are actually affordable and a rotating menu of seasonal sides there's bound to be something you'll like." u"This is one of my favorite places to eat I've eaten at the Flatiron location the Wall Street location....you name it! Unfortunately this location missed the mark. I ordered the Char grilled chicken with macaroni and cheese the cashew kale salad and the brown rice. First off the chicken was cold so I asked the girl to warm it up for me.  There was no place to sit because it's a smaller set up so I went across the street to eat.  My entire hot items were lukewarm the food tasted as if it sat out for a while.  I was sooo disappointed because I was starving and hadn't eaten all day and was craving dig inn.  I couldn't even go back to complain because I had to go to work but I definitely saved the receipt and I'll be back....it was horrible I won't be eating at this location anytime soon" u"WARNING - I had been going here for years and was never dissapointed. However I have been noticing that their staff is getting worse over time. Last Tuesday I brought home food with the meatballs and within one were several small pebbles. I almost broke a tooth on the largest one. I had to jump up and spit out the remainder. Not fun. I still have a pebble in a plastic bag for if I ever want to actually go in and show them what ended up in their food. It's a shame that they do not have a better handle on quality control. I cannot cut a food vendor slack that served me something that could leave me with an injury. I would give them a negative rating but one star is the lowest possible. So bye bye Dig Inn for me will never go into this chain again." u"I always see great reviews on this place so I finally went and I love this place!\nAll the food is fresh.\nThey have a great selection on healthy foods.\nIf you're craving something good to eat that's healthy and quick this is the place to go.\nIt's also very filling as well.\n\nThere's multiple locations in the city and some places are much bigger; this location is very tiny and only has about 4 bar seats by the window." u"Love it! Everything is cooked fresh and made to order. The whole menu is pretty healthy and a great source for your daily nutritional intake. \n\nThe menu is simple. They serve your choice of pr with a few side options from your veggies to your carbs. Very similar to Boston Market where everything tastes like a home cooked meal. Comparatively they are a bit more expensive than Boston Market along with a bit smaller portions which is a little bit upsetting but not a huge deal. \n\nA typical meal costs around $15. That'll get you half chicken with two sides. It's not bad compared to other lunch options in the city and plus it's healthy. That's the cherry on top of it all." u"The line is long but it moves quickly.  It's a tiny takeout only place.  The staff seems generally surly but I guess I would be too if I had to work in a closet catering to midtown office workers. Dig Inn has a great idea - real food fast simply cooked and fresh. Something that's not so easy to get in Midtown believe it or not. Their execution isn't great.  I've been there 4 or 5 times now and it has been hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is cooked fine others it's either too cold too hard raw or just tastes bad.\n\nI've ordered the same dish 2 trips in a row and the first time it was fine the second time it was terrible.  The chicken was cold and rubbery and the brussels sprouts were raw and bitter.  If they got the consistency correct it would be tolerable." u"The key to making this meal delish is in the sauce you guys.  The sauce!\n\nOne of my close gals is a frequent visitor of the Dig Inn franchise so when I was hungry and happened to be in the area I popped right in.  I told her it was my first time and she sweetly explained that I got to choose a starch base (quinoa YUCK or whole grain rice YASS) a protein ( I chose meatballs) and two sides (I got the mac & cheese and beets and orange).\n\nThank God she was a sweetheart to recommend eating it with sauces which I didn't really understand until I followed her advice.  Because the type of food they provide is of the rather 'healthier and organic' sort there's going to be a good chance that it's going to taste well bland.  Not in a bad way but in that 'whoa I'm definitely eating healthy' kind of way.  As someone who is of Korean descent and eats things coated in spices that only an ironclad stomach can process I would definitely need a kick or two in the taste department.  She suggested pesto and sriracha and of course I took them!\n\nI ate the meatballs first (cuz fatass) and then I mixed the sriracha sauce in with everything else.  It's really amazing how even though you mix in things that don't seem like they would go well together (beets and mac & cheese?) but they tasted pretty damn good in a uniformly way.  Don't get me wrong the food was definitely high quality but the sriracha finished the job.\n\nI also tend to have a picky digestive system and all the food settled in quite nicely without any cramps or bloating.  I can't wait to come back here and try the braised beef and chicken and all the other sides!  Nomnomnomnom\n\nP.S.  Oh and if you want to save money on drinks I suggest you bring your own Hydroflask of water.  They're kinda pricy but I'm sure it's because they're worth it." u"Years of working in midtown has taught me you always want to get your lunch early if you can. I like taking a short walk midday especially if I'll be eating at my desk. However like every fast casual place in the area it is packed around prime time lunch hours (usually 12-2pm)\n\nI've been to this location twice at 11:30am and 2:30am. At the earlier time I'm in and out in 5 minutes with the freshest possible food (they open at 11am). By afternoon the line extended to the door though it thankfully stayed inside the store. I got everything I wanted in my bowl but saw they were low on some dishes.\n\nThe food which changes seasonally like all Dig Inns is consistently delicious. I'll invariably prefer a veggie-packed grain bowl for lunch than some greasy deli sandwich or a salad (snore!). The portions are also generous. They usually try to pack the container with food which I appreciate. \n\nI've yet to find a Dig Inn I didn't dig. If I come across one I'll let you know." u"Stopped in for a quick & healthy option to-go. It did the trick but wasn't anything I'd probably get again or even remember. I built a quinoa bowl with kale salmon and peaches with the housemade Sriracha sauce for $13 bucks. The peaches looked better than they tasted but the rest was good- filled me without feeling too heavy. The place was small and almost empty both interior wise and food wise. At the time we walked in most of the food looked like everything was the last scoops which didn't appear appetizing. Unfortunately a bit of a disappointment." u"Pretty good healthy meals. You choose a grain two sides and a protein. The serving is plenty and the food is very tasty. My favorites are the roasted chicken Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts! The prices are pretty reasonable and worth it considering the portions and great taste. There literally no seating aside from two stools at the window so your best bet is to take your food to go. Oh and don't forget to ask for a side of sriracha sauce." u"Pretty good food for a healthy meal. I got a chicken on top of a bed of mixed greens. I also got Brussels sprouts and cauliflower for my sides. I haven't been to too many health food chains but in such an establishment I did want there to be some quinoa as a carb base as opposed to brown rice.\n\nOtherwise the food itself was pretty tasty but nothing to write home about." u"My new favorite place for lunch. Found this place while walking in the area and noticed a line to get in so the next day I ordered online for pick up and it's obvious why there was a line - Fresh delicious food! A nice variety of veggies and the chicken was excellent. A small unassuming place with great food. It's strictly take out."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
12.Sake Bar Hagi,[u"So I've been here way too many times now.\n\nGet shime saba and sashimi and fried stuff\nYakitori skewers are sort of a waste of money.  Avoid ramen.  Get mentai pasta instead.\nBest frog legs nyc.  Gobou chips with mentaiko mayo...\nCheap nigori sake and beer... happy place to relax with a group of friends.  Enter at 5 pm to 6 pm or if you're in the industry midnight to 1:30am.  Then go karaoke." u"Always on a hunt for good japanese food in the city and was excited by the prospects of this place. P.s/ It's down the stairs! \n\nNo reservations for 2 on a weekday for dinner but we were seated immediately - 530pm goodness!\nService was prompt and attentive - food was also served quickly. \n\nGreat value but the food was just normal - not remarkable. Perhaps I'd need to try the other dishes again.\n\nWe had:\n- unagi and tuna don: specials; great value at 15USD but there were only 3 slices of tuna?! Also the don wasn't japanese rice /:  (misrepresentation from menu's pictures) \n- ten don: quite a bit of tempura here. \n- seafood pancake with sauce and mayo: surprisingly good amount of seafood in this for what it was worth. Tad salty with the sauce but hey it's okonomiyaki!" u"Forget all the fancy restaurants in NYC known for their view or bright lights this little yet big settlement right next to Times Sq is the true meaning of a hidden gem (emphasis on the hidden because you won't notice it unless you're specifically looking for it.) Once you spot the restaurant's sign and find the right entrance you go down a flight of stairs until you finally reach the host stand where you can put down your name on the waiting list. Wait times vary from 15 min to maybe an hour depending on the time and your party size.\n\nOne of the first things you'll realize is that the menu is abnormally extensive which is a great or bad thing depending on how good your decision making skills are. Luckily I had a local to choose for us. \nHighlights: the spicy mayo-like with a hint of cod roe sauce served with the flaky crispy potato chips was AMAZING. It's so addicting I wanted to dip everything in it. The omusoba was the best I've ever had! The flavors were perfectly seasoned and balanced out very well. I love the noodles just as much as the perfection of the egg that was wrapped around and every bite was just as delicious as the last!!\nAlso worth mentioning are the seafood pancake and sashimi platter featuring salmon tuna and yellowtail. The seafood pancake was flavorful but a little too heavy and filling for me so a good deal for those who want good food while on a budget I guess. The sashimi was fresh especially the yellowtail which was so good it restored my love for yellowtail again! \nI personally would skip on the matcha mille crepe and just get it from Lady M. because it was too creamy/milky for my liking. \n\nOverall an amazing place to hang out with friends or go on a date because it'll definitely impress everyone!" u"My fond memories of Saki Bar Hagi completely outshine the reality of actually eating there last week.  I like the concept of ordering and sharing a variety of different dishes the casual vibe of an unpretentious izakaya.  The quality and taste of the food were disappointing maybe I just ordered the wrong things.  \n\nThe squid was average nothing to complain or rave about. \nThe spicy cod roe rice ball was hugely disappointing.  The outer layer of rice was nice and crisp and I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The rice had no flavor and there was a lot of it.  The roe was really fishy.  I love fish but this was fishy in the wrong way.  The vegetarian skewers set was not appetizing. The king oyster mushroom had a strange almost chemical flavor to it.  The shishito peppers were too spicy to be enjoyable.  The potatoes were good but there aren't many ways to screw up a potato!  The ginkgo nuts were my favorite sweet and savory.  I should've just ordered a plate of them and skipped the other skewers!\n\nThe sake we ordered was ok a little too sweet for me. I think it was about $20.  If we paid more I would have been upset. \nMy husband ordered a tonkatsu and he seemed happy enough.  I didn't try it since I rarely ever eat meat. \n\nI don't think I'll be back to Sake Bar Hagi.  There are so many better options in NYC Mira Blue Ribbon Mew even Yonocho.  And while most may be more expensive I'd rather spend the extra money on a better meal." u"A friend of mine recommended this place and I am so glad he did because I was completely impressed. It's very packed and congested inside and definitely very busy. It looks like a hot spot for dinner after work pregaming or late night food after the bars. A party of three only took a 5-10 min wait for walk in at around 9pm. \n\nService was beyond quick almost scary quick but I guess it represents the fast-pace life of a true New Yorker. I was looking at the menu while waiting to be seated and when the table was ready the server snatched the menu out of my hand. I did not find it rude at all but it was pretty hysterical how fast paced the server was haha. We got our drinks immediately then appetizers only took a less than 10 min after ordering. Same for dinner. Getting the bill usually takes the longest at restaurants but we got the bill immediately (also found it hysterical). \n\nAnyway... we tried a good amount of dishes:\nComplimentary snack (fried chip that you dip into this sauce that tastes SO BOMB!!!)\nSome sake that I don't remember name of\nSashimi - salmon yellowtail red tuna\nSeafood pancake\nFried frog legs\nOmusoba\nMatcha Mille crepe \n\nBeing light weight the sale was very strong for me. Took two big gulps and I definitely felt buzzed even though it was only 17%. The sashimi was surprisingly delicious - favorite being the yellowtail. I usually find the yellowtail sashimi as my least favorite but not here!! Each piece was extremely generous. Seafood pancake was a bit too thick for me but it was still good. Fried frog legs were nothing special. I probably wouldn't order it again though. The omusoba was so BOMB!! It's pretty much noodles wrapped by an egg as if it was an omelet almost with some cheese and a sweet sauce for the noodles. Definitely getting that again. Matcha Mille crepe was good but not better than Lady M. \n\nIn summary: try the Omusoba and the sashimi. I didn't get to try the skewers but I will during my next visit. There are just so many things on the menu that each visit you can seriously try something new. LOVE THIS PLACEE. It's so cozy too!!!" u'Ive never gone to japan.. but id say this had an authentic feel to it. Majority of patrons dining were in fact japanese and the menu had items that were appeared to be pretty authentic. \n\nWe had:\n\nchicken Karage- had a ponzu sauce with minced ginger around it. had about 3pcs. it was pretty tasty but was even better with rice. \n\nbeef skewer- that was pretty darn good.. but was pretty pricey. $5 for 1\n\npork belly skewer- pretty good too.. but also pricey- $4 for 1\n\npork pancake- the sauce on top was pretty powerful.. ginger sauce.. We had to scrape it off-after that.. if was manageable. removing the top layer.. then it was better. \n\nrice is extra. \n\nI would go here again and try other things. service was good.. majority of the food was good too. make sure to check the board for specials..' u"Food was sooo bad.. everything was too salty or sweet. \n\nI came here on a Thursday night around 6pm. The place was full but we were seated immediately. \n\nWe ordered:\nMiso ramen - AVOID! it was so salty I couldn't take more than 2 bites. \nBacon wrapped asparagus and pork belly yakitori - I liked the pork belly more. The bacon was average. \nScallop mushroom - This was good except I wish they used a different type of seaweed cause it was very stale and hard to chew in comparison to the soft scallop. The mushroom didn't have much flavor. Overall kind of sweet..\nCurry chicken meatballs - I would reccomend this if you enjoy japanese curry. It was interesting but too sweet for me. \nTropical and Peach beer - These were great but too sweet. They tasted like sparkling juice without any beer flavor. \nPeach sake - Don't get this. $12 for a tiny bottle that served 2 sake glasses. It was such a waste. \n\nThe bill was around $70 for 2 people. All I could think of was how bad my meal was. The drinks didn't make up for it either. Kind of upsetting. When I paid with my credit card it came back covered in grease. Thanks. I would avoid this place." u"Extremely popular but the staff gets you seated very quickly.\n\nThe menu is huge and you could spend months coming to this place and trying new things. I know nothing about sake and our waiter was not in any mood to help us pick. Thankfully we aren't picky so we enjoyed the random bottle we ordered.\n\nThe food was nothing to write home about - I think an ideal combination is to have some sake here and walk down the street to one of the popular ramen places." u"Sake Bar Hagi smack in the middle of midtown central is a popular choice for after work eats and drinks. I don't think they have an official happy hour or anything like that.\n\nThe ambiance here is similar to many of the hole in the wall type Japanese places in the city- lots of Japanese paraphenalia plastered all over the walls NHK being broadcasted in some corner lots of wood utilized in the design of the place... etc etc. I like this kind of place myself but it's not super different from a lot of other places you may be able to visit.\n\nMy friend and I got a pitcher of sapporo and it only cost like $14 dollars but it probably came out to about 2.5 beers per person which works out to like $1.8 per glass of beer which is really a pretty good deal ESPECIALLY in midtown. I also got a side order of beef tongue which was pretty much just regular beef tongue- but since you can't really get this cut of meat at regular western joints it was much appreciated. As I've always said the tongue is the best part of the cow.\n\nI also got the eggplant- it's supposed to be a special here and I've seen other people write positive things about it but I thought it was absolutely atrocious. There's some sort of sweet yet bitter eel sauce slathered all over it and makes eating the thing virtually impossible.\n\nOn an unrelated note I left my credit card here after visiting and these guys helped hold it for me- super appreciated for honesty and helpfulness." u"We love this place especially post-theater. The food is delicious and relatively inexpensive and the place has a lively boisterous atmosphere. Be prepared for a wait but it usually isn't unreasonable. We usually get a bottle of sake although it seems I regularly order something that's out of stock! Fried chicken gizzards are very good and I also like getting a bunch of skewers. Don't forget to check the specials on the board-we had an excellent soft shell shrimp last visit. Definitely on my list of regular stops in New York." u"Kushi Mori A Set (tori bara tsukime washy beef shishito pepper) - The potatoes were good. The shishito pepper was salty crisp oily and savory. \n\nKushi Mori C Set (oyster shrimp eel salmon with ikura and scallop) - Each one was good. I could do without the shrimp. \n\nHamachi Kama - Fresh humongous slice of fish and fatty. It had less flavor and was more tough than I expected but still great. \n\nUni Hama - Not memorable. \n\nTeppan BBQ (Lamb salmon sausage cherry clam scallop asparagus and zucchini) - Really oily. Had trouble finishing this. \n\nVegetable Stir Fry - Giant portions but very healthy and satisfying. \n\nInterior - Small and cozy. \n\nWait time - 5-10 minutes even on a Wednesday 'night' at 12:30AM!" u'Last time I left a review was 2014.  lolz  I have been going to this place at least once a week.  This place is still my favorite izakaya in NYC.  Still carries awesome food and great service.  Always satisfied with the experience.' u"This place is great! We came here on a Tuesday night after 8pm. There were people waiting but with just the two of us we were able to get seated quickly.\n\n// Food\nSeafood okonomoyaki - it's pretty thick almost like a deep dish. It was also very saucy flavorful and filling!\nKaraage ponzu - fried chicken over daikon and onions. Delicious one of my favs. Comes with 5 pieces.\nKakuni - super soft braised pork belly. My mouth is watering just remembering it! This was my favorite. Even better with the hot mustard that comes with it. Also comes with a bit of asparagus \nSaut\xe9ed squid in liver sauce - This was a pretty big portion especially since it was only $4.50. The squid was a little chewy and I wasn't crazy about it but still happy to eat it\nOverall we ordered too much food especially with how dense the okonomiyaki was. We had half of that and half of the squid order left and were stuffed. We also had 2-3 Asahi's each.\n\n// Ambience\nThis is a pretty cool spot. It seems lots of Japanese people go here but the majority of patrons were not Japanese. It has a pretty authentic underground feel to it. Service was great too." u"As a huge Izakaya (Japanese gastropub) fan I am delighted to discover another joint that can be added to my list of Japanese tapas restaurant & bars in the area near my work! This gastropub is located in the basement level on 49th street between 6th and 7th ave (close to the 7th ave end). It can be easily missed since the entrance is next to the Sapporo restaurant which would have been mistaken it you don't read the sign carefully.\n\nMy friend and I arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night. We were seated immediately with no wait. Just like many other types of izakaya Sake Bar Hagi features various types of tapas including yummy fried chicken/squid/potato tempura sashimi and all sorts of yaki (grilled) deliciousness to filling goods like fried rice and noodle dishes. Not to mention the drinks here are so inexpensive! They have Japanese cocktail drinks (mixed with soju and sake base) and beer cocktail along with your go to Japanese beers and sakes. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the yuzu cirtus sour and calpico sour ($6 each) for our drinks. As for the food we ordered the mentai pasta ($9.50) Small fried mori ($8.50) salmon sashimi salad ($12) and the pork okonomiyaki ($9).\n\nOur food and drinks came out in less than 5 mins (talk about efficiency!). The drinks are delicious but I could barely taste the alcohol (which was a little disappointing). My favorite dish of the entire meal is definitely the mentai pasta. I love the creaminess of the sauce mixed with the spaghetti and the cod roe was just the right amount of saltiness. In my experience this pasta tasted best when it is hot. So if you order this pasta make sure to finish it before it gets cold! The portion of the fried mori is huge (to our surprise since we only ordered the small)! I can't imagine how much fried chicken squid and fries you would get if you order the large. It was deep fried perfectly with the right amount of grease. The salmon salad was a let down - salmon was decently fresh but the salad wasn't any spectacular. Okonomiya was tasty but it failed to wow me. \n\nOur service was good - waiter responded to us quickly and even gave us recommendation when we had some trouble deciding which ingredient to choose for the okonomiyaki. We were in a hurry to rush out after dinner since we had a broadway show to catch in the area our waiter gave us our check fairly quickly. Overall Sake Bar Hagi offers cheap and good tapas and it is good for after work happy hour or a simple dinner. I'd come back again to try the rest of the food items on the menu and see if they can further improve!" u"Always wary when looking at places to eat near Times Square as most of the area is packed by tourists (obviously). This spot not only has a solid rating but it's been around seemingly forever. Wednesday night and about a 20 minute wait for two people.\n\nSpace is smallish and the ventilation isn't the best. However we got seating at the bar where it didn't feel crowded at all. Menu is handed to us - a large selection of seemingly everything that can be a little daunting. After much debate decided on the Pork Ginger Don ($10) - a heaping pile of diced pork/ginger/veggies on a bed of rice soaking in a layer of sweet and salty sauce. Extremely filling meal though hard to combine the layers when the bowl is overflowing with ingredients.\n\nConsidering the crowd service can be slow but the food comes out fast. Great option when in a bind in the neighborhood." u'Pizza tempura. Pizza tempura!\n\nAs an item of food it was terrible: two uneven hunks of pizza (the frozen kind) that were oil-logged and had somehow missed on all its glorious potential. But it\'s DEEP FRIED PIZZA on a Japanese pub menu...! Always be true to yourself.\n\nFor years Sake Bar Hagi has been a favorite viewed as a "hidden Japanese izakaya basement gem etc. etc. for those in the know." Here\'s my opinion: it\'s an OK place to go if you are trapped in this (frankly awful) area and have a *serious* craving for izakaya food - the same way you might have a *serious* craving for a burger and someone gives you a spongy McDonald\'s thing and you\'re like "yessss thank god."\n\nChicken nanban (chicken cutlet with Japanese-style tartar sauce) was soggy and greasy but admittedly hit the spot. Large portion. \n\nAgedashi tofu (fried tofu in dashi broth) was very bland. Large portion. Soggier than usual. \n\nFried geso (squid legs) on the specials menu was quite tiny oversalted.\n\nNot that this should be a strong indicator of much but neither staff nor customers are Japanese. The space certainly has the energy of someplace as close to Times Square as it is - filled with tourists who carefully select ramen and fried rice.\n\nDo know that the food is mediocre and the beer runs freely ($5 Kirin pints). We came in around 10pm on a Saturday and didn\'t wait but the place was full. There\'s nowhere in the actual restaurant space to loiter so they may tell you to wait outside if no tables are available. Rest assured that you won\'t miss much by giving up and going elsewhere.' u'Did they hire a new chef?  The chicken gizzard is my go to dish here but they are ruining it. They are putting a coating on it which ruins the texture and taste of the dish. The coating is gelatin like probably corn starch.  It is so gooie. I tried eating it but had to give up about half way through. I started removing the coating so the gizzards are edible. The leeks I got was also strange. They are rubbery. The folks next to me got the chicken liver so I saw they had regular leaks. \n\nPlease bring back the chicken gizzard I love without the gelatin coating and regular leeks.' u"I love this spot! It's so fun and food is good. There's usually a wait the place is small but tables move quickly (15-30min wait). \n\nGood to go in 2 or small group so you can share and taste more dishes. Totally accommodating for solo diners at their bar though! We ordered a Beef Sukiyaki Udon Soup a Spicy Sashimi Salad and the grilled selection (seafood meat and vege) from the special menu plus beer and sour cocktails. Previously the Karaage and Yakisoba have been my favorite but the Sukiyaki and Sashimi salad was delicious too. Will def return!" u"Need a spot to gather some good friends for good grub (and a few pitchers of beer)? Look no further! Bar Hagi doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait a bit pending your group size but your patience will be rewarded! Everything we consumed  (great for group sharing!) was super delicious and the wait staff was quick to replenish our Sapporo pitchers so we were never without a beverage to accompany our grub. My favorites were the Uzakusu $9.50 (grilled eel with vinegar sauce) the Takoyaki $7 (Pan Fried Octopus Balls) and the Pork Ginger Don $10 (saut\xe9ed pork belly and onion with ginger soy sauce over rice). We also tried the Okonomiyaki $10 (Japanese pancake with pork and cheese) and the Miso Katsu Don $12 (Breaded Chicken Cutlet with Miso over rice). Couple things to note: Bar Hagi is down the stairs from street level (upstairs is a totally different restaurant which I hear is good as well). Also there is a 2 hour sitting maximum which they do enforce (they brought our check/tab when the clock started to run out). So order quickly and let the delicious times roll! Lastly the price point here is wonderfully low. You can leave with a belly full of delicious food without hurting your wallet." u"Great food. Hip and modern atmosphere. Love all the food choice. Menu has lots of selection. Staffs could be more friendly. Sanitation is there. Couldn't complain. Will recommend for all friends in NY"],0.6808,0.528,0.472,0.0
17.Lillie’s Victorian Establishment,[u"I came across this place on yelp I was so into the decor I just had to come see it for myself!\nI'll admit I was a little put off it was by Times Sq because most NYers avoid that area like the plague! We know it's tourist trap central.\nHowever it's closer to the theatre district which is a little more apropos.\nI wasn't sure if you needed reservations for brunch so I emailed them to ask.\nNot only did they reply quickly the Manager Jes put me in for the date I was asking about. We already had a good start! \nGlad we had reservations cuz when we arrived we were seated quickly. My friend and I had a lovely brunch and great convo. We didn't feel rushed and we had a wonderful time. Will be coming back again for sure." u"So cute yummy and the perfect escape from the chaos of times square.\n\nI was looking for a place to meet friends who were in town and we wanted a convenient place with good food and strong drinks.  This was the perfect place.  Prices were very reasonable decor was killer and very unusual for a 'times square restaurant.'  The service was on point the night we went.\n\nCan't wait to go back!" u"This place is so beautiful and cool and I had such a nice lunch here but I have a few complaints that make it only a 3-star establishment.\n\nWhen I first walked in the hostess as extremely accommodating and sent me back to my friend waiting for me for our Friday lunch. The space is a little dark but beautifully decorated with a cool old-timey feel. I really liked the vibe.\n\nWe sat down and caught up. I was so distracted with our conversation that I didn't really notice it took our waitress 15 minutes or so to come over and ask what we wanted to order. For lunch they have a $14 special so you can order a sandwich and a drink. I got the grilled chicken sandwich but decided to just have water because I had to be back at the office. \n\nOur meal game in decent time. The sandwich was delicious: soft bread juicy chicken pesto mozzarella with tomato and lettuce. I really enjoyed my sandwich and the fries it came with. However after the food was dropped off our waitress disappeared. My water was never refilled no one check in on us to see how our order was. After over an hour of eating and chatting I decided to walk over to the station and ask for a check. The waitress provided it right away but again didn't come back to retrieve our cards so we had to go back to her to get her to charge it. Very frustratingly slow service.\n\nThe food here is great and the atmosphere is fun I would just be wary of coming during lunchtime if you are trying to keep a tight schedule." u"Music and French fries: 4 stars \nSteak: 2\nService: 2\n\nVisiting the Big Apple and went here before a show. Made reservations and found the service and food terribly disappointing. We both ordered steak and both were overcooked one of which was dry and barely edible. I had fries which were the highlight of the meal. My friend ordered mash potatoes which were cold and bland. Once we ordered we never saw our server again. Someone else brought our food out and another person brought the check. \n\n2 stars: can't recommend and won't return when visiting NYC in the future." u'Lillie\'s might actually have the best/coolest decor I\'ve ever seen. At first I was afraid that such a theme would end up being tacky and overdressed but it all seems to work. Inside it feels very Victorian but it also has a 1920-30\'s vibe going on too. At times it\'s so ridiculous it\'s hilarious since there\'s a projector that plays music videos and the videos themselves get... mixed too. In any case it\'s a really enjoyable restaurant to just sit in.\n\nI came here to celebrate my roommate\'s birthday calling ahead to make a reservation and asking to leave a note for the wait staff so I wouldn\'t have to find an excuse in order to be able to discreetly inform our waiter that it was my friend\'s birthday. When we got their the hostesses were ready to spring a "Happy birthday!" onto my friend which was really nice. At our table there was another card from Lillie\'s wishing him a happy birthday and the waitress taking care of us also got the memo. At the end of the meal they even comped us a $9 chocolate mousse cake with a candle!\n\nThough I really appreciate the fantastic service I have to give this place 4 stars because of the prices (truly though 5 stars if I was just recommending it for someone\'s birthday). At the end of the day it\'s quite a loud place for dinner which makes it hard to carry a conversation and I had a lot of trouble finding something that I felt was reasonably priced for the option. However I feel like I got really lucky with the $14 Avocado BLT which was surprisingly great and with the addition of avocado it feels almost reasonable as a price. It also came with solid fries.\n\nI\'d definitely come back though since it\'s an experience that\'s hard to replicate elsewhere. I hear there\'s good brunch here too so I\'ll have to check that out for sure.' u"The grandeur of victorian royalty makes the visit here worthwhile especially when they pimp it up for the holidays. \n\nBreakfast/brunch was pretty basic but it's not gonna bankrupt you. \n\nEven the most aggressively average looking guy can be magnificent in an environment this grand and visually stimulating. which is why i bring dates here all the time!!!" u"Great place. Food was fast and delicious.\nOur server did a great job. The place was crowded but that didn't hurt us at all." u"Lillie's is a great place for brunch on Sunday. The brunch was $18 which included a drink as well. The omelette was great and the potatoes were seasoned really well. We did not have reservations but they were able to accommodate us anyway. The host and the waitress were very hospitable. The overall atmosphere of this place made brunch even more enjoyable. It is beautiful on the inside and adds a grand feeling while dining." u"Lillie's has friendly service in a beautiful dramatic setting with great music and decent but not overly exciting food. The hummus was chunky and served with bread I would describe as thin flour tortillas carrots and celery. It was okay. The fish and chips were delicious while the chicken sandwich and the avocado egg BLT were fine but not particularly interesting. I'd definitely go back to Lillie's to hang out and have drinks but probably won't go back for dinner." u"I came to Lillie's for a quick bite and drink with my girlfriend before a play on 47th. We were immediately blown away by the beautiful decor and majestic look of the place.\n\nFor food we had the ravioli and the grilled chicken breast sandwich. The ravioli was delicious and the sauce was very creamy while the sandwich was pretty average with nothing special to it. We also got two beers at an affordable price.\n\nOverall Lillie's was perfect for a quick bite in the area and I can see myself going back." u"Cool looking place.   Wanted to love it.  Food was 'meh'. Service... slow. (Food came very fast! With a server not our waitress)  but  waitress? V-e-r-y  s-l-o-w....  15 mins for Bill to come... could count number of people in restaurant.  People behind us got up and went to bat to get their own drinks....\n\nSteak Frites- nice size. Not a big meal. Perfect for later when you need real food with drinks.\n\nMaybe it's a thing when you're in the city but I have a hard time ignoring Roaches on the floor and on the wall. Others did not seem to notice so maybe it's just me.\n\nNot sure why this place does so well on Yelp. It was not horrible but I expected something far better." u'While wandering around one night slowly working our way back to the hotel we heard live music coming from this place and we decided to stop in.  There were no seats available at the bar so we found the hostess and she sat us.\nWe only stayed for a drink and dessert.  My boyfriend got some kind of whiskey.  I got the grilled pineapple mojito. We split the mud pie.  It was all very good. The dessert was a bit rich for our taste buds though! \nAll in all we enjoyed the live music and the atmosphere.  We would come here again!' u'Stopped in for brunch before going to see Bette Midler in Hello Dolly.... atmosphere is eclectic mix of murals on the ceiling over the chandeliers the Corinthian columns behind the bar and all the assorted knick knacks all over the walls. \nOur server Lacey was bubbly and eager to help recommend items from the brunch menu. I chose the Avocado BLT others had the burgers and Eggs Benedict. Everyone enjoyed their choices and remarked how good they tasted.  \nI would definitely recommend stopping in for brunch or cocktails anytime.' u"I really wanted to visit this restaurant after finding this place at Yelp. The only reason was the extraordinary interior decoration. Service: Great. Atmosphere: Great. Taste: not special. We ordered chicken tenderloin shepherd's pie and beers. The pie was too bland but it was still good to have. The chicken was awful. It was overcooked so the crisp was too hard. The beer was good though. It really helped to wash out the greasiness of the food. It was an interesting. I would recommend this restaurant to friends who want a quiet and elegant atmosphere." u'If you were searching for a girls night out spot nestled in among the lights of Times Square... this is it. Rococo room with high ceilings dim lighting and a short cocktail menu.\n\nThe service doesn\'t really know how to handle the space. When I walked in with a friend at 8:30 on a weeknight they told us to take anywhere along the bar. Given that there were no seats along the bar we asked if we could have a table and they said no so we grabbed these weird wall-facing seats by the door. There was no service there so we had to search for an opening at the bar (not easy given the post-work crowd) to order ourselves. Once we were able to communicate with an overwhelmed bartender our drinks were made quickly and we were able to pay relatively quickly as well.\n\nI had the Spicy Poblano a chili-infused tequila drink on the rocks. Well one very large rock. My initial reaction was "oh my god this is way too spicy to drink" but I settled into it. The heat wasn\'t overwhelming the alcohol content was strong and the pepper gave it a nice vegetal taste. $13 reasonably spent.\n\nMy bar for Times Square Bars is low so I would definitely keep it on my list but I wasn\'t wowed. The space is impressive but I didn\'t feel welcomed there just pushed off to the side. The drink list was very short. There was no real service to speak of and the crowd was all suits. If you came earlier (with coworkers maybe?) and clustered around the bar this might be a better time.' u"I came to Lilie's with one of my friends twice in one week and had the opportunity to try items from their regular menu and their High Tea Menu.  The busiest time appears to be dinner while lunch time is a bit calmer perfect for afternoon tea. \n\nDinner Experience:\n\nFor Dinner we had:\n\n-Fried Calamari - 3.5/5 - Overall the Calamari was good it was not too heavily breaded and had a light flavor.  I think they were lacking some salt and they tasted a bit briny.  \n\n-Fish & Chips - 5/5.  The breading is just right and does not overpower the fish and the tartar sauce was exactly how I like it.  The fish was not overly greasy which is a problem that sometimes happens with  fish and chips. Their fries are also very tasty so overall this was probably my favorite. \n\n-Steak Frites - 4/5.   The stead was good.  The taste was definitely there the only thing is that it was a bit on the chewier side for some reason but overall it was definitely something I would eat again. \n\nService - 4/5\n\nHigh Tea Experience:\n\nThe experience was very different in part because they were not as busy and this is apparently a new item on their menu that has only been around for about a week or so.  We decided to try all the food items since that is the most fun way to do you are not left wondering what you missed out on.  The highlights for me would be:\n\nBest Items:\n\n- Egg Salad Sandwich - Honestly this is probably the best egg salad sandwich i had in a long time.  It had the perfect amount of Mayo and herbs to make it just about perfect. \n\n- Cucumber  sandwich - It was very good a bit on the spicier side because of the mustard but definitely a lot of Flavor.\n\n- Lemon Tarte - As a person who usually doesn't like lemon tarts I was a bit hesitant about ordering this dessert but I am glad I did.  It had a very subtle lemon flavor and was not overly sweet.  If you usually like lemon tarts this may not be as lemony as you would want. \n\n-Earl Grey Creme Brule -  Once you crack through the sugar layer you end up in the Earl Grey Custard which is great.\n\nThere was only one item I was not a great fan of and that was the Strawberry Sherry Triffle it was Cream custard and fruit inside of a jello.  In my opinion it was overly sweet and had a bit too much going on.  \n\nService - 5/5 (We actually had the best waitress ever she was very funny attentive and seemed genuinely interested in feedback for the High tea)\n\nOverall we had a great time as the food was good and the service was generally outstanding.  I will probably come again if I ever happen to be in the area." u'I\'m in town on business and googled restaurants near my hotel to have a nice dinner. On previous nights I had dinners with colleagues but tonight I ventured out on my own.\n\nI found Lillie\'s Victorian on Yelp and not only did it sound nice but the menu also really appealed to me. It was only a short walk so I headed over not thinking that I would an issue getting a table for one. It was a Saturday evening so I was willing to wait if necessary. There were two young hostesses and when I inquired about a table one of them said they had no tables because they had just seated the last one. That was it. No waitlist suggestion that I wait nothing. So I asked and was told I could sit at the bar "if I could find a seat." Again that was it. No customer service at all. And all this time the other young girl just stood there staring at me. \n\nI did take a look down the long length of the bar but by this point I was totally turned off and this place lost its appeal for me. I\'m not used to such poor service so I was very disappointed!! I left and found a much better place around the corner. I would NEVER try to patronize this place again!!' u"We enjoyed our time here. We came after a play and it was super busy though we managed to grab the last table available.\n\nThe decor is Victorian and very interesting to see lots of pretty things all around. The food was good and the drink menu was decent too.\n\nConsidering how busy it was the service was not bad at all. The clientele seemed to be half theater goers and half locals coming in after work.\n\nNote that they also are a part of the Yelp cash back program so I got a 7% cash back on the bill here. All automatic against my registered card. Nice!\n\nWe'll be back at some point on a next trip since I'd like to see it in the daylight and before the rush of people come in." u"We enjoyed a lovely afternoon at Lillie's! Excellent lunch specials a fun atmosphere and interesting decor. The service was excellent and it was wonderful spot to relax after a morning of sightseeing in the neighbourhood. Our nine-year old appreciated the Halloween decor as well!" u"Loved Loved Loved my experience here!!! We were unable to book a table ahead of time but the hostesses were so sweet and found us the perfect booth. Lacey was our server and she was the absolute BEST! She was so attentive upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu. We had several apps (the pretzels hummus and Parmesan fries) and all were delicious. For entrees we had the Chicken Sandwich Chicken Wings Chicken Pot Pie and Half Chicken... hmm I guess we like chicken . All of us were extremely impressed with the food and we cleaned our plates but I think the Pot Pie was the best so creamy with a light fluffy crust. Clive the manager walked around and checked on all the tables ensuring everyone's satisfaction with their meals. Ooh and the drinks!!! I had the cucumber vodka elderflower thingy and it was SO good. As a native New Yorker I despise this area of town but since I love the theater I tend to come here more often than I'd like to admit and finding a good restaurant that's not too touristy is difficult. Lillie's for the win- we will definitely be back if only because our new best friend Lacey works here."],0.9313,0.481,0.519,0.0
68.Pig ‘N’ Whistle,[u'Really good steak fajitas! They were delicious. The steak was outstanding it it. \n\nThe service was mediocre at best. I give the female server a 2 star. She made me feel like I was a burden interrupting her. She messed up the salad dressing order and was slow to refill my drink. Fortunately the food was very good and made up for it.' u'Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon because they advertised the NFL package and I wanted to watch a game while we had time to kill in the city. We were taken upstairs and promptly sat. I thought it was weird an Irish pub would have a Sunday brunch menu that was all Mexican breakfast foods and the beers on tap certainly didn\'t scream Irish Pub.  Not looking for Huevos Rancheros at 2pm on a Sunday. Young skinny female bartender with what seemed like a thick Irish accent took our order but never explained any deals they had going on (which I later saw were advertised on the wall when I went to the rest room). I ordered a Shocktop draft and went to the restroom came back and had something else waiting for me not sure what it was but was dark and heavy (and of course more expensive when I saw the bill later). Ordered soup specifically as an appetizer and an entree and asked that there\'d be some time between them. Well guess what of course they showed up together.  They were decent but can\'t say the same about the service. The waitress/bartender never checked if we wanted another drink which we did as we wanted to have more beers with the game we were watching. We were three feet away from her work station and outside of bringing me the wrong beer had never checked in on us.  Eventually she asked if we wanted the bill and I said yes since she didn\'t seem to care if we wanted any more drinks. The bill was $39.20 I threw in three $20.00 bills for a total of 60.00 to cover the tab and hoping for change on the $20.00 to split up for a tip. We\'re seated literally three feet away from the register yet waited and waited and waited later the girl goes by and says "thanks" as if that was it and then went to wait on a table in the balcony area. There was NO way on earth that excess was intended as a tip and later she comes back and goes away again then later sees me try to flag her down and asks if we were waiting for our change and I said yes so she promptly peels back a $20 bill and gives it to me so despite ignoring us she knew exactly what she was doing. I explained I only gave that extra $20.00 bill in order to have it split up into change to leave a tip. I hate to think negative thoughts but the way it all went down there\'s no doubt IMO she was trying to skim it all as a tip and hoped I gave up waiting and just left. I was prepared for the argument over whether I left $40 or $60 as I thought for sure it was coming; but I guess even she realized that wouldn\'t work as I wouldn\'t leave just an $.80 tip.  I just didn\'t appreciate the whole dishonesty in it all. What ever happened to good service? We actually wanted more drinks. What ever happened to a waitress/bartender taking a tab and money and asking the customary "do you need change?" to make it very clear what\'s going on? Right before we left there was a group of 4 young men at the bar that all left grumbling and leaving poor tips because of the same person and judging from other reviews I see this same person has reflected poorly on the business quite a few times. Looks like it\'s time for her to find a profession that works for her as this isn\'t it.  She only had a couple diners to wait on and was all flustered she also got into it with a co-worker when he tried to merely speak to her.  At best she was standoffish and worst dishonest.  FWIW maybe I was wrong but that nice thick Irish accent we were greeted with was gone by the time we were ready to leave and asked for our change back.  With so many food drink and places with tvs in the Times Square area I will have no problem taking my business elsewhere whenever in the city.  The food was a solid 3.5 but the bartender drags it down to as low as I could take it.\n\nPS: one day later and I\'m getting harassing messages from a Joanne M. from Belfast because of my comments regarding the Irish bartender....hmmmmmm' u"Typical Irish pub with the usual trimmings and trappings; one of two we visited during the BEST weekend ever; we stopped for an early afternoon drink as we walked about Times Square.  Located just a few blocks from the main drag this little pub is situated just across the street from a TGI Friday's with a large sign.  Can't miss it.  Inside there's a long bar that runs the length of the first floor with mini two-top bar tables along the opposite wall.  There's an upstairs area too but I didn't see it.  The bartender was friendly the topic of discussion was the then-upcoming Mayweather vs McGregor match and of course it was Team McGregor in there all the way.  I argued the point of wisdom and experience over youth and verve and to humor me the bartender specified that it wasn't Mayweather's age but McGregor's overwhelmingly superior fighting skills that would carry the match.  I allowed that in a MMA setting his statement would be true but as this fight would go according to NSAC boxing rules the outcome would go the other way.  But despite the potential for heated debate the atmosphere remained relaxed and friendly and that's just the sort of establishment I favor.  As I know we'll be back in Times Square in the near future I am sure I'll see this place again.  And maybe order something to eat so I can update my review eh?" u'Drink review only A-OK ranking is the headline.  The Pig N Whistle was supposedly a watering hole of John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd back in the early days of SNL.  If it was good enough for them its good enough for me.  The beer was cold here and the draft beer lines running well.  The service was fast and friendly.  This place seems more local even though its in Times Square.  Two thumbs up.' u'We thought this would be a nice place for a quick drink but we were taken aback by the horrible attitude from the bartender upstairs (short blondish ponytail heavy Irish accent). First she told us we could not sit at a table out on the terrace unless we were ordering food. We sat at an interior table and she then told us we couldn\'t sit there either unless we ordered food. We said we were ordering fries and she begrudgingly backed down. Mind you we could understand this "policy" if there was a wait for tables but we came in during a non-peak time  and they were at 30% capacity at most. \n\nThe icing on the cake was when we placed our order. Our party of 5 ordered 2 beers 2 sodas and a bottled water. Apparently having 3 people who don\'t drink alcohol is a sin to this lady. She turned around and stormed off saying "JESUS CHRIST". At that point we grabbed our belongings and walked off although I almost regret not staying behind and building up a nice tab then stiffing her on the tip. It\'s the least she would have deserved. \n\nWe ended up across the street at TGI Fridays.  OK yeah it\'s a chain but the prices were great they had he beer my brother-in-law REALLY wanted and they treated us great from the moment we walked through the door. If I could give P&W 0 stars I would but Yelp doesn\'t give me that option.' u"Very loud being as the bar is right next to the dining area. Not very big so nowhere for sound to go. I had their signature burger which was delicious. It took a while to be waited on but it was pretty busy. Have a mediocre wine selection. Not badly priced for being in the middle of time square. Definitely a place to visit for delicious food as long as you don't mind not being able to hear the person sitting across from you." u'Seemed promising when we walked in ...until the bartender got upset that not all of us were drinking . Apparently ordering 1 soda in a party of 5 really hit a nerve with her because she stormed off and yelled "Jesus Christ" after already being super rude to us when we asked to sit at a table In the literally empty restaurant...Blondish pony tail hideous fake lashes with a heavy Irish accent tending the upstairs bar.' u'This is a typical NYC Irish pub. The beer is good cold and the keg lines seem well maintained. \n\nThe hostess is nice and seats you promptly. The wait staff has always been nice and attentive. \n\nThe food is good for pub food. It is great for a quick lunch and is fresh. If you want fancy or upscale this is not the place. It is fully as expected for Irish Pub food.' u'This is definitely one of the better options in the area for pre-theatre meal. A pretty normal bar but it was a great laid-back contrast from the whole Times Square scene. I had the edamame veggie burger which was quite tasty especially the pretzel bun and the cole slaw topping. The fries that came with was also yum.' u'Stopped by to meet with some friends around 10PM on Saint Patricks Day. There was one waitress/busser with a shit attitude that kept forcefully pushing her  way through the understandably large crowd. \nThe real issue was when we were trying to leave we went out through the door we had entered through that lead to a staircase. They had poured cooking oil all over the stairs for some reason. I have no clue what purpose this served or how it was a legal or intelligent tactic to take on a busy night.' u"Food was great fast service and curteous staff.  Had the salmon with mango chutney...yummm.  we also had Sheppard' pie and pulled pork sandwich.  Both were spot on near perfect.  Highly recomend eating here if you are in Times Square doing your touristy thang." u"Decent for a bite to eat before or after a show in NYC. This used to be my go-to place in NY with the family for a good meal. But in recent years it's transformed into more of a sports bar than an authentic Irish Pub. The look and feel are still quaint and enticing but the menu has changed a bit and in my opinion not for the better. with so many options in NYC I wish they went back to their old ways which really set them apart from the pack." u"Small place but you definitely get your money's worth. Order yourself the mango salmon and thank me later!!!" u'Came for an afternoon drink with the boyfriend during a last minute trip to NYC and was not disappointed! Boyfriend is a whisky guy and recommends the James Joyce. My pomegranate infused martini was nice but nothing extraordinary -- that being said I would recommend it if you are like me and not really into beer or whisky. The service was excellent: quick and friendly. This is definitely a good spot close to Times Square\nBut not in the center of the chaos.' u"Friendly welcome and wonderful Irish server. The upstairs is cozy.  Fish tacos and pretzel bun burger were tastey. Also enjoyed Manger's Irish Cider and a frothy Guinness." u"Found this place while waiting for a friend near Times Square. Was seated for a good 10 minutes before someone stopped by to take the order. The lady who took the order was friendly. Food and drinks were mostly good partly because I ordered quesidillas which have very little reason to go wrong. The guacamole did not taste fresh. Fries came out good. Goose Island was a nice hoppy and malty IPA on the tap. Some exiting customers were thanked by the staff at the door and some weren't. If you dont have great expectations over and above an average meal this could be a decent spot in the ever so busy Times Square." u"Really great Irish Pub!\n\nFish n' Chips and Sheperd's Pie are the top reccommended meals and my dad and I agree!\n\nFish n' Chips: not oily at all! And great cook on both the fish and the fries salted juuuust right. A bit rich and fried food feeling though would have to eat a salad after to feel better hahaha.\n\nSheperd's Pie: My dad is holding both thumbs up. LOL\n\n4/5 only because the servers were kind of meh. Our server was great but the others kept staring at us while we ate. Kind of creepy and annoying" u'My husband and I split chicken penne it was delicious!  We enjoyed the dish very much and would recommend this place.' u"They did a very good job of getting us out in time to make the curtain for our show.  \n\nMy wife enjoyed her burger platter with fries even though the fries weren't crispy like she ordered but then again we started off by telling our server we were in a rush. \n\nI had their Caesar Salad for $14 and added chicken for another $6.  It was a good Caesar but at $20 I thought on the high side for an Irish pub even in the heart of the theater district.  \n\nThe place had a very lively bar scene and is probably better suited for after dinner drinks and food rather than pre-theater dinner.  It's just that it took us 1 hour and 45 minutes for get from the Holland Tunnel to the Theater District to park in a garage and since it was then after 7PM our dining options became limited.  \n\nThere is a one-person bathroom downstairs and 3 one person bathrooms upstairs.  That info could save you a lot of time especially if you are eating or drinking downstairs.  \n\nWe appreciated them getting us in and out." u'If you\'re looking for an "Irish Pub" experience that is the furthest thing from and actual Irish Pub then this is the place for you. There are only 2 Irish dishes on their menu and 1 Irish beer (guinness).We did have two salads that were good but that is the extent of my review. Overall nothing Irish or interesting stands out about this place. I would recommend to keep walking.'],0.3612,0.385,0.615,0.0
72.Shake Shack,[u'I came on a Monday night and surprisingly there was no wait. \n\nI ordered the ShackBurger and it tastes like what you would expect a cheese burger. The potato buns were fluffy and tasted a bit sweet. The patty is cooked to medium and pretty soft but I still prefer in-n-out burgers. \n\nI ordered the cookies and creme chocolate shake. Surprisingly the shake was not too sweet and I was able to finish it. I feel like the shakes here are what makes this chain unique.' u"Ahhhh....NYC where the great Shake Shack originates from.  This location isn't hard to find as its located on a busy main street with big bright flashing lights.  We had just arrived in Manhattan and were starving.  It was almost 11 pm and were still stuck on Cali time.  We decided to Yelp some places with in the vicinity of our hotel and Shake Shack popped up.  SCORE!   They're open until 12 am.  Yesss!  \n\nAs we entered the establishment we were kindly greeted by the staff.  The place itself is not too big.  You stand in line order your food and are sent off with a pager.  Once paged you pick up your food.  This location is very busy so it's kind of hard to find seating.  \n\nI ordered the Chic'n Shack which is a fried to crisp chicken breast with lettuce pickles and buttermilk mayo.   It's simple not overpowered with all kinds of toppings and condiments which is how I usually like my sandwiches and burgers but this....THIS was simply DELICIOUS!  The sandwich itself isn't too big.  I kind of wish I ordered two.  Same with the Hubby.  He ordered the Double Shack Burger and found it fairly small.  I tried his burger and thought it was pretty good but honestly I'm more of a poultry gal so of course the Chic'n Shack got my vote.  We also shared an order of fries.  The fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  For dessert I ordered a cup of vanilla custard.  I absolutely love their custard!  I could binge on a gallon of that stuff.  It's great!" u'I passed by this place on my to work and would always see the long lines out the door and finally thought I would give it a try to see what all the hype was about. Honestly the place is overhyped. We were greeted by a staff member who handed us a menu at the door. I ordered the Chicken Shack which was greasy and tasted like something I could get at a fast food chain. My co-worker ordered the double hamburger and also agreed it was very greasy but nothing special. Fries were good but I would not go out of my way to come here. Pricing is not bad  being so close to Times Square in NY. The burger was $7 and the fries were $3.  \n\nI would rather prefer 5 Guys just a few blocks down that offer amazing hamburgers and freshly cut Cajun fries with free peanuts.' u"It pains me to write this because I'm such an avid Shake Shack recommender. This location though.... I'll avoid as often as I can resist but mainly during peak tourist seasons.\n\nIt's always SUPER crowded here and it's probably 85% tourists -- which is completely fine and wonderful for this business and New York in general -- but lots of tourists like to rest and hang out at the tables when they're done eating. AKA it's difficult to find an open table or spot at the standing tables even after the decent wait for our food. I could easily get past the wait if I had somewhere to sit and it was decently clean but it's honestly so busy and crowded I think it's also difficult for the employees to keep things clean throughout the day. And the bathrooms... it pains me that people can be so gross.\n\nThe food is always a good choice at Shake Shack - the burgers Chick'n Shack fries shakes etc. - but I'll try to find a different location before coming back to this one." u'The only reason Shake Shack doesn\'t get 5 stars is because it is so hard to find table space to eat inside. \n\nWhen I come to NY I have to have my "Shake Stack" fix. The portobello mushroom with the cheese oozing out of it along with a meat burger. The best burger ever!  Had a side of cheese fries that hit the spot!' u"There was no line to get in around 11:25pm on a Friday. We were greeted by staff at the door who were too nice for New York. Seat yourself type of place - get your elbows up and ready because patrons are just ruthless here. \n\nWe ordered the Chicken Shack and the Smoke Shack along with a vanilla milkshake. The Chicken Shack was a little disappointing it tastes similar to a Jr. Chicken but it was still good. The Smoke Shack was bomb though. The vanilla milkshake was very thick but amazing. The burgers were a little smaller than we expected - we would've ordered a side or another burger if we had known and if there was more time before closing. Seen some reviewers complaining about the price but coming from Toronto I think they're pretty decently priced and affordable. We returned back to Canada craving food from here. \n\nAlso you'll get access to washrooms (which aren't the cleanest and may not always have tissue paper) with your receipt where you will find a code at the bottom to punch in at the restroom door." u"I live in the heart of Jersey City where culture has barely reared its head before ruling it out as a habitation spot. Alas  vegetarian options are not plentiful here and while I lamented this to my friend expressing I craved a good veggie burger that actually tasted like a burger rather than a black bean brick  tofu  or some other emulsified concoction  the response was curt and simple: Mick Mack Paddiewack gotta try the Shack! \n\nYes  it turns out they do have a vegetarian burger that even bears the carnivore seal of approval. No black beans  no compacted cabbage pea medley  no tofu  no cauliflower no soy  and no seitan. Between these buns is a crisp deep fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheddar cheese--what a sinful idea!  Finally a veggie burger thats a splurge  why should you meat munchers have all the fun? \n\nIt is savory and yummy  a real treat. You'd be very much mistaken to believe that this is healthy because it's a veggie burger however. It packs on a whopping 490 calories yet surprisingly doesn't feel so heavy when you eat it.\n\nFries are nice and crisp with a nice  assortment of condiments. Shake shack true to its name  also offers a variety of shakes and floats to hit the spot. I had the strawberry mint lemonade which was extremely refreshing albeit a tad too syrupy for my liking. \n\nI like that I was able to order online ahead of time and pick up my meal as I walked in. Convenient. My only complaint is that many of the items are a bit overpriced and that the food isn't quite as filling or mind-blowing as I expected it to be. Otherwise  it's not a bad joint to stop by!" u"I'm from Cali and the burger standard is In-N-Out. I was impressed with shake shack's taste I think it definitely has better flavor since I got the smoke shack. Also their crinkle cut fries blow in n out away and they're super crispy. I tried the vanilla milkshake which was very good and didn't feel too thick or overwhelming. \n\nI would give the edge to shake shack if it weren't for the fact that in-n-out costs about half as much for the same order.. so this chain definitely loses out in terms of value. \n\nService was very average and you can tell their staff gets overwhelmed with the sheer customer volume. Also takes quite long to get the food. \n\nFood: 4.5/5\nService: 3.5/5\nValue: 3.75/5\nOverall: 4.25/5" u"Ah yes the infamous New York City Shake Shack. This will be the second location in New York that I've had a chance to eat at and the third location I have had a chance to visit. \n\nThis location was interesting. Being a block or so from Times Square there was a constant line out the door. We decided to come during an off hour to make sure we avoided that line. Thankfully that meant we were in a line but only indoors.  We were able to commandeer a booth and squeezed five of us in. We ordered 5 burgers and some fries as well as a beer and a coffee shake to distribute.\n\nI was not a fan of the ridiculous wait for my beer. She had a terrible time trying to pour an entire pint of beer into a plastic cup. It LITERALLY took 10 minutes. I stood there while I watched her pour ounces and ounces of beer foam down the drain as she frantically tried to fill the cup with liquid. Yikes. That was unpleasant. \n\nMy Chicken shack was unfortunately not Insta-worthy. However it was still tasty. Everyone was satisfied with their burgers without being overly full which is a success in my book. \n\nJust don't get a beer here - for your sake the sake of the people waiting in line behind you and for the poor people behind the counter who don't know how to pour a beer." u'Yummy!! Their veggie burger is delicious - so much to the point that I had shake shack twice in my 5 day trip to NYC. Took off one star only because the lineups are lengthy and their milkshakes are diabetes in a cup.' u"One of the touristy must try's in NYC. This location is quite busy due to its proximity to Times Square so if you can take it to go I recommend doing that. The crinkle cut fries are my favorite and the burger is good for fast food." u"Shack Burger is good. Shack Stack is better. \n\nHow can you not like a fried cheese filled portobello mushroom stuffed in a burger.\n\nThe fries with cheese and bacon actually take away from how good their fries are naturally. They're crunchy on the outside and melt inside. Hard to believe but try it next time. If In-N-Out didn't have animal style fries i'd say Shake Shack wins this one.\n\nLike a true California i'm still loyal to In-N-Out. Their animal style fries and burgers can't be beat!" u"Key words: (1) located in the tourist trap--order online ahead or prepare to wait for a bit; (2) a bit dirty; (3) enter through the avenue door not by the street corner in order to get in line.\n\nIt is Shake Shack so this place does deliver quality food at an affordable price. It is also a stone's throw away from Times Squares so it is always packed. I think Shake Shack does allow for online ordering through the app so that's probably your best bet. \n\nBe mindful that when your buzzer goes off the food is still being made so you'll see people crowding around the pick up station all of them holding the buzzer going off. When I was there there was a long line for the bathroom as well and you need a code on the receipt (though when there's a line you don't really need it I suppose). Because so many people frequent this place it was a bit dirty here but nothing I didn't expect." u'Being from LA and a huge In N Out fan I was not expecting much out of Shake Shack but I must say that was a fantastic meal. Ordered the double shack with no tomato. The burger was definitely juicy and the bun was soft which made my fingers pretty oily. The cheese fries were awesome. I am not a fan of crinkle fries but oh man those are some bomb fries. I see myself craving shake shack back in LA!' u"First impression with this place is... Overhyped. The burgers are good but doesn't justify the price and wait. \n\nThe meat is juicy and tastes fresh but the burger as a whole is too greasy. Fries are very good but the cheesy fries is a joke with a very small amount of cheesy. Shakes are really good and offers many flavors.\n\nSince I am from California it's hard not to compare this to In N Out. Shake Shacks burgers are priced as a gourmet burger but the food doesn't feel like one. My meal was about 15 bucks with fries and shake and I would happily pay the same amount going to Red Robin or cheaper for In N Out." u'You did not disappoint. Shack stack I love you and your fried mushroomness with cheese oozing out of you! Sooo good! Why would anyone order anything else from here? \n\nThere must have been some Asian tour bus that made a pit stop while we were here. Old Asian people were stalking tables at every corner! Luckily we found a spot right after we ordered. My kid was crying a bit bc she was hungry so they gave her free ice cream. That was so nice. \n\nKeep your receipt if you want to use the restroom.\n\nThis location is super crowded. Should have gone to the Madison square one so we could have enjoyed our burgers in the park.' u'Y\'ever been to Five Guys? You ever tried Big Mac Sauce? Put the two together and you\'ve got Shake Shack.\n\nHonestly not sure what the fuss is over this place. Are the burgers tasty? Sure but they\'re no better than any other "high-end fast food" burger joint like Five Guys in fact Five Guys not only makes a better burger but also has cajun fries which we all know are 1000x better than crinkle cut. \n\nPerhaps if you enjoy milkshakes this place is worth the wait but even then I\'m not sure. Certainly it is not worth waiting in line like the people who arrived shortly after we did had to do (we must have just beat the rush). No fast food place is worth a line up out the door.\n\nBut then again maybe I\'m just bitter because I asked for no cheese and they put cheese on my burger anyways...' u'I had been let down by a few hyped up restaurants in New York but this actually surpassed my expectations! Burger was very good juicy but not too fatty. The milk shake was absolutely delicious like drinking ice cream! The fries were also served crispy. I only ate half of everything because I felt bad about eating out so much but I regret it and wish I ate the entire thing!' u'I remember it better 3 years ago did it change or just a memory?Still a very good burger for a med thick. fresh meat burger' u"Had to visit the classic Shake Shack in NYC.  A bit touristy since it's close to Times Square.  But really good!  Worth the hype and the wait.  The burgers are good the shakes and floats are great!"],0.4926,0.262,0.738,0.0
22.Dim Sum Palace,[u'Wife and I are here our first night this trip. We loved the wide variety of dumplings and other choices. All the people there were very nice and a guy who appeared to be the owner asked us how it was on our way out and thanked us for coming.\n\nThe food was excellent. We got 2 kinds of dumplings and some steamed buns and egg rolls and some crispy fried pork ribs--delicious! Nice hot tea too.  Everything was just like I have had on my trips to China so authentic to boot.  Great place.' u"I never had dim sum before so it was a wonderful experience. I think I tried all the classic dim sum dishes that I was interested in. And Yes I ordered chicken feet ( Jamaicans also eat this maybe not this style but yeah... ). Also on Weekdays from 3-5pm Dim sum and even drinks ( tea beer cocktails and some wine are 50% off \n\nBBQ Pork Buns: it was interesting it really is like eating candied bacon minus it being hard. My husband also like this one lol\n\nShumai: I loved the combination of the pork and the shrimp it was delicious . My husband enjoyed it too\n\nShrimp dumplings: this was also a winner for me I wished I ordered more than one.\n\nLotus leaf sticky rice: my husband thought it was a wrap and bite into the leaf lol  overall it was ok  \n\nChicken Feet: again not my first time eating it it's just seasoned differently but I really enjoyed it.\n\nEgg Custard bun: it different then how I imagined it but it has that savory sweetness to it's a perfect combo.\n\nSpare Ribs: it was ok but nice to have a meat dish \n\nFried Milk bread:  I fell in love it was everything and more. Even my husband enjoyed this \n\nMy husband ordered Soup dumpling because he didn't really like the other foods. It was a little on the small side  but it was nice.\n\nRose tea for 4 dollars taste like hot water with no flavor no nothing.\n\nSo all in total not including tip it came out to around 37 dollars for 2 Adults and 1 infant" u"One of my coworkers gets delivery from here all the time so I decided to join him this week.\n\nThe prices are pretty cheap. You can eat your weight in carbs and fried food on a modest budget. It's more expensive than Chinatown but not too bad. For $25 including tax and tip I got turnip cakes (3 large bricks) pork and chive dumplings (3) and salt and pepper soft shell crab (one glorious large box).\n\nDelivery was disappointing. We were quoted 30-45 minutes and dutifully called at the tail end of the window only to be told they had lost our order. Fortunately it came along less than 15 minutes later but still irritating.\n\nMy dumplings were only okay; too heavy on the greenery. My turnip cake was awesome and hearty studded with pork fat and served me through a good three meals. The crab is a showstopper. It's definitely terrible for you and you can feel your heart racing from the sodium but the seasoning is amazing and addictive. I ate everything in that box including the little scraps of pepper and onion.\n\nNothing will be a surprise if you've had dim sum downtown before but this held up to my standards for the cuisine." u"This review is specifically for their happy hour from 3-6!\n\nI love me some dimsum and I think I have pretty selective tastes for it. I wasn't expecting to find a good dimsum place in the middle of midtown especially for such a great price! We came here at 3 for a birthday celebration on a Saturday and had a party of 15. They were very accommodating even though we had to combine tables split checks and pull chairs. \n\nMy favorite was the pan fried shrimp and chive dumpling the ha gao (translucent shrimp dumpling) and the duck turnip cake with XO sauce. Soo good and perfect to satisfy my salt cravings but don't expect to be finding large pieces of duck in there! The shrimp dumpling skin was a little sticky in texture which I don't prefer but it's one of the better ones I've had here in the city plus the shrimp inside was pretty good and well seasoned.  The congee was good too! Had bits of egg tofu and pork. \n\nThe restaurant may be a little heavy in their seasoning which I'm fine with and I feel most people prefer anyway but if you have a lighter palette this might not be for you. \n\nAlso make sure to check your bill - we were initially charged for 3 dishes that we ordered but never got. We had so many people and so many orders so it might have been confusing it's no big deal mistakes happen. \n\nOverall would definitely come back on a happy hour - I couldn't imagine paying these prices otherwise!" u"I stayed at the Riu Hotel across the street and this place has been on my list. So when I was waiting for my room to be ready it was the perfect opportunity to try this place! \n\nI got chrysanthemum tea most places that I've been to add sugar to chrysanthemum tea but this place didn't which was nice! \n\nI ordered the variety sample dim sum. It was interesting to try a bunch of different ones they had. \n\nI also ordered a dessert dumpling. GET THE GREEN TEA DUMPLING DIM SUM! Sorry for the yelling but that's just how good it is. The center is filled with a nutty-sesame salty-sweet goodness." u"EXCELLENT.\nThis isn't your usual dumpling palace. It is a fairly nice clean not cheap establishment.\nOrder anything on their menu and it will be delicious. This is my second time there and I already have favorites.\nThe wontons in schezwan sauce the stir fried instant noodles all kinds of shu-mai (seafood chicken pork and shrimp) shrimp spring rolls spicy mushroom veggie chicken dumplings. \nThey bring the food piping hot and fresh. They have this amazing ginger paste of sorts that is absolutely delicious and goes very well with the best thing on the menu- the ribs! I have never had something so soft and flavorful. Definitely try it!\n\nI will be going back several times for sure!" u"First time having dim sum in NYC (coming from Boston). The selections are par for the course in regards to dim sum (though the menu selections have pictures if you're not familiar with the options).\n\nThe food was quite tasty. The bbq buns were actually very good with a very delicate doughy bun (many places have it way too dense). They have soup dumplings which was surprisingly to me. The skin is nice and thin which is better than what I've experienced in Boston though the soup and filling weren't as flavorful. The shrimp dumplings (har gao) were delicious and probably the highlight of the selection (quite the feat since everything was delicious).\n\nI will say that though the food was yummy. The prices are higher than what I've had in Boston so be mindful of that!" u"The place is not that big and it gets pretty busy but the dim sum was delicious. It's a menu ordering dim sum type place but the menu is full of pictures for those needing a little help. My absolute favorite dish was the sweet custard buns they will melt in your mouth and ooze with sweet custard goodness. Prices and dish sizes are pretty fair. The service wasn't bad but wasn't great - above avg for a Chinese place. We also tried a variety of dumplings chicken feet taro cakes - all delicious. I was very satisfied with the food definitely try the sweet buns they will blow your mind!" u'Food: Legit dim sum at a reasonable price. Mixed Veggie Dumplings are vegan! Holy $h!t they\'re also delicious. I\'d come back a hundred times for these. Perfect balance of salty and sweet and a perfect variety of flavors: cabbage carrots potatoes. "Half-liquor" bar available for those who wish to drink. I had standard issue prosecco. \n\nAmbiance: Typical tight little Chinese place with somewhat bright white lights at dinner service time. Interesting grunge rock and 90s pop hits music though. Knocking off a star for that.\n\nService: Friendly attentive quick. \n\nOverall a surprising four stars. I\'d come back.' u"Solid and authentic dim sum place in Hell's Kitchen area great for if you don't want to make the trek all the way to Chinatown for your dim sum needs. It's hidden on restaurant row but wasn't too crowded on a Sunday morning/afternoon. \n\nThe restaurant feels like your typical dim sum place crowded with as many tables as possible squeezing through chairs to get through things. It was a very long restaurant one way with a bar in the front but it wasn't very wide overall. We ended up sitting in the backroom with about 6 other tables including some large 8-person ones. \n\nThe dim sum menu has pictures of everything and you just write numbers on the items to order which is pretty easy and straightforward. They have all the basics: shiu mai haw gao rice noodle rolls (cheung fun) xiao long bao chicken feet steamed pork spareribs etc. \n\nWith the three of us we ordered around 8 dishes:\n- Shrimp haw gao\n- Pork and shrimp shiu mai \n- Chinese broccoli\n- Xiao long bao: Larger than the taiwanese version I normally have but I good amount of soup inside and very plump good with the vinegar sauce \n- Steamed pork spare ribs\n- Roasted duck dumplings: these were pretty delicious as well \n- Chasiu cheung fun \n- Egg roll (inside) cheung fun: super good with the crunchy texture inside the rice noodle roll though it seems weird\n\nA lot of the dishes were pretty normal typical of what you get at most dim sum restaurants. The total ended up as $20 per person. It would've definitely been cheaper in the Chinatown area but it was a solid place and in the middle of the touristy area in NY so it was an expected price for the very filling dim sum meal. I would definitely go again if I was in the area and didn't want to take the time to go to Chinatown. Service was good as well and food came out pretty fast!" u"Great shrimp dumplings and awesome general Tso chicken. The issue is that the $18 dishes don't come with white rice just a plain plate. Delicious cocktails" u"This is my first time in NY. So it was only logical to try out the Chinese food here. This has been such a great experience and the food here is definitely amazing. The service is fast the food is fresh and delicious. It was so delicious that I ordered it tonight again for dinner. But this time we asked for delivery after the long day we've had walking all over NY. Servers were very prompt and professional. Definitely would recommend this Cantonese restaurant to anyone that visits NY!" u'The BBQ pork bun mixed mushrooms dumplings crispy garlic spare rids and the shredded duck dumplings are so good. The best dim sum in New York City! And I love to eat lobsters  especially the lobster with ginger and scallions. Love this place! Definitely will come back.' u"First visit! Thank God there's a dim sum place in this neighborhood! Food was delicious they have a basic selection of dim sum I wish they had more variety. Service was also attentive the wait on a Sunday afternoon was about 15 minutes for a table." u"I wish I knew there was a happy hour special but apparently it's 3-5pm. I'm not sure if it is everyday so I'd call to check. \n\nThis place is overpriced but it is located by times square. I didn't want to go all the way down to chinatown to get my chicken feet fix. They have less choices than chinatown dimsum but they have the essentials like CHICKEN FEET! I also had the shrimp crepe and the siu mai (seafood)- all pretty good. Quality is pretty good and fresh. \n\nThey give you a piece of paper and you just check what you want. The beef ho fun is pretty good! \n\nService is fast and friendly! If you have a dimsum craving and do not want to go all way down to chinatown this will satisfy your craving. Dimsum for 2 came out to $53 not including tip...so you can see this is more pricey than chinatown but like I said this location is prime." u"Not the best dim sum place but it is Hell's kitchen after alll. The dumplings themselves were mediocre but passable. Stay away from the soup dumplings. After a while the wrappers become hardened. The pan fried mini buns were good. The ha Gao which is the dish I use to judge a place didn't taste that fresh. Despite all of this there was still a good number of Asian customers so I guess that's a good sign." u'Solid Dim Sum within a short walk from Times Square.  The waiter brings a sheet of all of the options (no carts) then you check off what you want.  The menu is dumpling heavy but unique in nature like the double mushroom.  A few house drink offerings pair well with the food.  A quick attentive  affordable spot.' u"I am so glad that there's a great Dim Sum place like this in midtown NYC. I always go to Chinatown for dumplings which is kinda far from where I live. \nI went to Dim Sum Palace twice so far and both visits were amazing. Their shrimp Shu Mai is my favorite. It is really juicy inside and the skin for Shu Mai is so chewy. I also love the sauce that goes along well with all the Dim Sum. (I usually mix this sweet sauce with chili sauce).\nThe cilantro pork and yam dumplings were not quite my style though. Maybe it's because I am not used to such a flavor but there was this distinct smell that I am not familiar with. \nSo if you are a nooby I recommend you to order Dim Sum that's got shrimp inside to be safe!\n\nTheir chow fun with chicken was so much better than what I expected as well. Usually chicken meat in such a kind of menu is not that delicious. Their chow fun was perfect in every sense however: the chicken meat noodles sauce etc. I strongly recommend you to order this dish if you like noodles!\n\nLastly I like how clean and modern this restaurant is. This is another reason why I am attracted to this place tbh! It's pretty spacious relative to other restaurants in NYC.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a good Dim Sum place in midtown I recommend you to visit Dim Sum Palace:)" u"We went for happy hour from 3 to 6 then we came back later on that night around 11:30. This place opens late. That's almost unheard of in Cali. We got the Xiu Mai tofu with shrimp vegetables taro cake shrimp cake and chives dumplings. This is one of my favorite dim sum places." u"Incredible experience and great options to suit any dietary restrictions on the Dim Sum menu!\nI personally don't eat any pork and I found so many chicken seafood and vegetarian options.\nMy cocktail was unexpectedly great too. \nMy husband and I ate like kings and got a few drinks and the bill came up to $38. Here here to their happy hour special!\nWe didn't even realize we were in the happy hour time frame when we had arrived around 3pm on Saturday.\nLooking forward to coming back in a larger group to really conquer the menu."],0.8268,0.176,0.824,0.0
127.La Masseria,[u"We ate here prior to a show. I messed up by not getting an Open Table reservation in advance but a quick call to the restaurant en route solved that problem. \n\nUpon arriving we were promptly greeted by the host and they seated us at a nice table. Throughout the meal service was really attentive without being intrusive. \n\nFood was excellent. We ordered fried zucchini as a shared appetizer. It came out promptly in thin deep fried strips. Delicious! My wife ordered a special of mahi mahi with shrimp and spinach. Best fish we've ever eaten. I had the penne which was excellent as well. \n\nWe wrapped up our meal with their vanilla cheesecake. Soft and delicious it served as a perfect capstone to a great meal. Highly recommended!" u"If you're in the Theater District looking for outstanding Italian cuisine you need go no further than La Masseria on 48th Street.... we've dined there pre-theater  and post theater multiple times and have never been disappointed. Prices are fair allowing you to stay under $125 for two if you don't go overboard on the wines and if you tend to share your appetizers and desserts.... we have found that  the staff  was very accommodating in that they provided us with last-minute  outdoor seating when we tried to make reservations approximately 45 minutes before arrival time.\nAs for the cuisine my wife and I shared a very generous seafood salad( Terra Mare Tavoliere) comprised of baby octopus and cuttlefish with fava bean puree and broccoli rabe. Since the portions are very generous I would suggest at this be shared as an appetizer or otherwise you will have no room for the entree. Being in the mood for pasta I opted for their gnocchi prepared with radicchio and a wonderful taleggio cheese sauce.... not recommended if you are on a Statin .My wife thoroughly enjoyed her ravioli also made with cheese in a light tomato sauce... another member of our party thoroughly enjoyed his calves liver made with onions and a blueberry vinegar preparation. I sampled the dish and felt that blueberries should be relegated to my breakfast cereal and not calves liver.\nAs for dessert I wanted to share the tiramisu which I've had in the past and can say it's wonderful..  but I was forced to share a tartufo which sort of did the trick... bottom line is that La Masseria is a wonderful Theater District Italian restaurant with a great staff which will bring you  wonderful sophisticated Italian cuisine without breaking the bank.... which presumably has already been broken by outrageous Broadway Theater prices." u"I went to dinner here with my father who was visiting from out of town and my cousin.  When I read the reviews and saw the menu I was very excited to go.  We all enjoyed our meals and service was very good however when my father got back to his hotel he had horrible food poisoning.  He had the linguini with clams and anyone who knows about seafood can tell you it only takes ONE bad clam to cause a violent case of food poisoning.  I felt so bad for him he was throwing up all night and he is also a medical doctor he is fully aware of the symptoms of food poisoning -- It was not the flu!  The next day he was flying out but we stopped by La Masseria to tell the management about this mainly to warn them so no one else would get sick but also thinking they could at least offer us a discount if we would give them a chance to make it up to us or some sort of compensation to apologize.  But NOPE.  The manager kept insisting that no one else in our party got sick and our food was all made at the same time.  Well my cousin and I didn't order the clam linguini or anything with clams in it!  What a stupid thing to say.  He basically stood there indignantly and more or less shoo-ed us out the door.  The place wasn't even crowded in was before lunch they were just setting up so its not like he was busy.  SO outrageously unprofessional I almost thought he must be joking at first.  I don't care how good my meal was I am disgusted by this situation and will never go back there.  Not to mention it was insanely overpriced.  The bill for three of us was over $350 and we only had one bottle of wine and two cocktail between us.  Save your money and health and stay away.\n\n\n\nI am now editing this post because the NYC Health Dept contacted me to interview my father about the incident.  They were VERY concerned and also amazed that this establishment did not even attempt to follow up or respond to the food poisoning incident.  My father lives out of the country so this won't be possible but its interesting to me that this place STILL has not reached out to me for even so much as a sincere apology!   Rude inconsiderate and unsafe operation.  They clearly do not care about their patrons and rely only on their tourist trap location.   Im blown away by their indifference to someone who was incredibly ill after eating at their venue.  I pray that no one else has this experience." u'Ordered restaurant menu dishes. Entrees were sea bass and chicken ratatouille. Could be a 4 star restaurant. The appetizers were very good and the free bread sticks were even better. Lackluster chicken and desserts. Sea bass was good but not good enough to come back to.' u"Pre theater lunch at La Masseria. They don't offer a lunch special. Everything is a la carte.  We were 20 minutes late for our reservation but were seated right away. The room is open and warm.  The waiter was very nice.  We had a house salad with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was huge.  Then we had the ravioli.  It was just OK.  They give you bread bread sticks and a caper sauce   The tiramisu was good.   Nice restaurant in the theater district." u'Absolutely delicious food.  Great service.  Ordering drinks can get expensive; I guess this is a wine snob haunt.' u"Came here by recommendation of a coworker and it's a sister restaurant to one of our faves so we decided to give it a shot when my boyfriends parents were in town. Hello new favorite spot!\n\nThey start you with an assortment of bread and breadsticks with lentils in olive oil so classic but simple and yummy.  I split the eggplant rollatini with my sister which was perfect - just enough so that we weren't full before our entrees came and cooked beautifully: a little creamy a little salty a little crunchy. Love! Other spectacular appetizers included the burrata - pic below but they gave you the WHOLE HUGE BALL!! That's what I am always hoping for when I order burrata but it's rarely the case.\n\nFor dinner I had the bolognese with homemade fresh tagliatelle so good but i wish it had a little more sauce on top. My sister got the orchiette with sausage & broccoli rabe which was really good I think because it was much less bitter than usual. Finally my boyfriend got the bucatini vecchia Roma with onions bacon and pecorino which was creamy and really amazing. Pasta was definitely the way to go for the main course so many of them are homemade fresh pasta which makes a world of difference for sure! Portions were great and we had plenty of leftovers. The wine was fabulous as well. We unfortunately did not have room for dessert but I'd love to try it next time!! \n\nI have to say with its proximity to Times Square & the theater district I was surprised at just how delicious and adorable this place was. We will undoubtedly be back hopefully sooner rather than later!" u"Best Italian restaurant that I have ever been in Manhattan! I love the all the pasta and desert there!!! And don't forget to ask the daily special! That will surprise you for sure! Who said pasta is all same???! Its totally different world when you went to La Masseria! The bread is awesome!!!!! I have tried several Michelin three star restaurants and the BREAD here is the BESSSSSSSST!!!!!!!!!!!!" u"This is our FAVORITE restaurant in all of New York City. Any time we come out this way we make our reservation ahead of time. \nThe staff is so friendly. From the servers and the wait staff to the host. They all make you feel like family. Speaking of family you see neighborhood family's in here all the time.\nFood here is outstanding the Chef and crew are perfectionist. \nGreat for all..." u'Despite being in the middle of New York theaters this is a slightly hidden gem.  We came here for lunch that wound up looking more like a dinner:  some Chianti alongside a start of carpaccio which was followed by home made gnocchi for both finished off with a cappuccino for her and an espresso for me.\n\nI couldn\'t decide whether to go with the classy and conservative "excellent" or the down-to-earth enthusiastic "Sooooooo good..." so I\'ll say both: Excellent. Sooooooo good.' u'Great food - excellent flavor and quality. Their pasta is made in house and simply incredible. Nice ambiance great service and great location in the theatre district.' u'Don\'t often give five star reviews because something usually falls a bit short of our expectations. Our lunch at La Masseria hit all expectations and more. Starting with the staff absolutely friendly professional and authentic. We arrived a bit before the kitchen was open but we were seated and the breadbasket was there in no time. A glass of prosecco and a nice "Italian cafe" feel made us feel very comfortable. We split a salad which they were more than happy to do and it was big enough for two. Although the specials all sounded great we went with the gnocchi and tagliatelle bolognese. By far the pasta was the best I\'ve ever had. Finished off the meal with an espresso and we were ready for a show.   We definitely recommend La Masseria if you want great Italian in the theater district.' u'This is a great restaurant in the heart of Times Square.\nThe price is definitely higher than average but location the restaurant itself and the most important thing the food are all amazing.\nThe food design was fantastic and not only it was perfectly designed it was tasting fresh with the highest quality.\nThe only downside for us was the waiter who seemed not having a good day and did not give us that welcoming face/service; \nI cannot rate them lower than 5 just because of this as everything else was 100% perfect.\nI will definitely go back and totally recommend this place.' u"Can't go wrong with dinner at La Masseria if your friend's from italy feel nostalgic of authentic Italian food... the lentil olive oil bread spread is an exquisit way to accompany their excellent wine selection while deciding on which delitious meal to go for..." u'Wonderful Italian Bistro in the Theater District offers and creative Italian fare that excites the taste buds from the offering of wonderfully soft bread and oil to top flight deserts. Any dish they serve with cheese is special because it is so fresh and creamy. At lunch the Penne with red sauce is packed with flavor because it is rich with bacon smoky mozzarella and basil. Rabbit is prepared perfectly even for those not crazy about game meats. At dinner we all enjoyed the Fried Calamari the assorted meats platter and especially the Octopus to start. May have been the best Octopus I ever had. For an entr\xe9e we went with the special Sole topped with Shrimp Homemade Linguine with Lobster and the Red Snapper each exquisitely prepared and presented. The service is attentive and totally on point. I am definitely going back yet again and soon.' u'Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night. The place was pretty packed so we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated.\n\nWe started out with a couple of appetizers--the burrata and meatballs. Both of the appetizers were very good but I thought that they way they served the burrata to each person separately was a bit odd.\n\nNevertheless for my main entree I went with the bolognese at the waiters suggestion. This dish was not the best pasta I have ever had but it was solid and the sauce had good overall flavor.\n\nTo end the meal we ordered a couple of tiramisus for the table and they were decent as well--just about what you would expect from an Italian restaurant.\n\nOverall the food here was decent but the prices were very high. I blame it on the proximity to Times Square but it is just a bit overpriced in my opinion.' u'Visiting New York from the west and wanted good traditional Italian.  This place definitely satisfied those cravings.  The service was amazing.  The hostess was very friendly and the wait staff was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu.  As far as the food the mozzarella buratta appetizer we ordered was fantastic.  The cheese was so fresh and bleeding insouciantly off the plate.  The gnocchi I order for my main course was probably the best I have ever had.  My mom got a spaghetti special which was fresh and full of delicious shrimp.  \n\nThe menu was well laid out and provided the diner with a range of different priced items some more expensive and some less.  I would happily dine here again.' u'Had a wonderful lunch here on a recent Sunday before a show at the Walter Kerr Theatre next door. I had a reservation but since I was solo I sat at the very welcoming and comfortable bar where the bartender took very good care of me. I started with a pomegranate lemonade cocktail with just the right balance of tart and sweet then had the octopus appetizer with green beans artichokes and avocado. I followed that up with a main course of rabbit which was phenomenal. It was served in a Le Creuset pot with a light herbed sauce and some Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes as sides. The rabbit had a crisped skin but the meat was incredibly tender. It was a fantastic dish all the way around. I should note that the appetizer and the main were both pretty large courses and I would have been full with just the main but I wanted to sample a couple of things and they were too good not to finish. Oh well these things happen.\n\nFood service atmosphere and location are all winners here. Highly recommended.' u'We celebrated our anniversary on Sunday night sept 17th. The food was excellent but the service was awful. The waiter was very arrogant and did not make us feel welcome. They .ade the table next to us biggrr so that the chairs were actally touching our table. I put down o  the reser2rhat it waz our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement.  I would not recommend this restaurant' u'Really tasty homemade pasta! The place is elegant and the service is really good. The prices are a little high but according to the restaurant style and location worth to go and try it some time.'],0.3291,0.105,0.895,0.0
18.Tanner Smiths,[u'This is such a surprisingly cool bar located in Midtown! Being in the area it is I guess I expected it to be incredibly touristy or way overpriced but Tanner Smiths was neither of those things. \n\nThe place itself is pretty large with additional space located downstairs. The ambiance was dim with candles lit all around which gave it a classy vibe in addition to all the other nice furniture and things adding to the prohibition theme. However the vibe was very upbeat with throwback tunes and other top hits playing throughout the couple of hours we were there. \n\nThe bartender we had was great! She was incredibly quick to serve people waiting for drinks and could throw together a great cocktail. Most of the cocktails offered are in the $14 range but they also offer a great selection of beer and other liquors. While there I tried the Excuse Me Sir which is a gin based drink and it was wonderful!' u"We live for bars like this one. Tanner Smith's is a hidden gem tucked away amongst the chaos of Times Square. The vibe is incredibly cool---charleston-style with a pre-prohibition feel. The decor is fantastic. Very old timey/modern feel-there is something about Charlie Chaplin movies playing while listening to Kanye....\n\nTheir cocktail menu (which is a book really) is impressive. We ordered the pretzels and duck confit spring rolls first. The pretzels were great but the duck spring rolls were incredibly greasy greasier than normal confit. The pork bun sliders were great but the portion was small for the price. Mole chicken tacos were flavorful but dry. \n\nWe will definitely return for cocktails and the bar vibe and to give their brunch a try. Unfortunately the food didn't hold up." u"Brandon is an excellent waiter I was debating between duck sandwich and pork tacos and he advises me that if I didn't like the duck I could send it back. I order the duck and was impressed! \n\nThanks for the hospitality Brandon for the friendly service!(I never had duck before)" u'Came here before a 54 Below show and it was delightful! \n\nThe place is pretty dim from what I expected it to be but no big deal. It\'s mood lighting. But one downside is that the area that my friend and I got seated the tables were pretty close to each other. With that being said when we got seated the guy next to us said something along the lines of "you can move to the other table if you want" but 1) the other table wasn\'t even set yet and 2) We were fine.  So I guess my advice is if you\'re a party of two...maybe not plan on having super deep or intimate conversations here because the table(s) next to you can def hear every word. BUT I can tell that they accommodate for big parties so it\'s a plus! \n\nI ordered the burger (chicken) and got the friend eggplant chips for appetizers. Both were mouth drooling good. But fair warning the burger is messy so if you\'re on a first date you may want to choose something else.lol. Is it a burger that you can\'t get elsewhere? Prob not but it still doesn\'t disappoint. The chips with that maple syrup drizzled on top was oh so delicious. You have to get it. It\'s a must. You won\'t regret it. And good came out super fast. Always a plus if you\'re hungry. \n\nServer was super sweet and friendly.' u"This place is a gem. Excellent cocktails. Excellent food. Their deviled eggs gets a whole new meaning. The break skillet nachos were great. So was the carrot cake. Just wow! We randomly strolled in just after brunch ended on a Saturday and enjoyed our meal and drinks. \nDefinitely coming back! \n\nMust try's - order no. 7 and the billy something were absolutely kick- ass!" u'I first have to say that service was excellent! As soon as I entered this restaurant staff and workers were warm and inviting. The host explained to me that the basement is a speakeasy type of theme and quiet for conversations. We said yes to that. This place is huge. They have a lot of seats that stretched into the next room on both floors. \n\nWhen we entered the basement I was super thrilled to see that it was a dark intimate space with stylish decor and feel to it. Our waitress was polite patient and informative. \n\nMy friend ordered rose wine I ordered the cotton club and my other friend ordered the cotton club too after tasting mine.\n\nFor food: I ordered lamb sliders for $15 my one friend ordered chicken tacos for $14 and my other friend ordered shrimp tacos for $15. We ordered the new york style poutines but garlic fries came out instead. Tbh the poutines were extremely salty so we were glad that they made a mistake and gave us free garlic fries which by the way tasted so much better. \n\nI will be coming back here to try other dishes and drinks for sure! Love their cocktail menu. It is definitely a speakeasy theme. It is huge! They have all these hidden rooms. Will be coming back here soon! :)' u"3.5 \n\nCame here for dinner on Saturday at 6pm and were seated immediately in the back with a noisy crowd. The restaurant was a lot bigger than I imagined. The waitress was very nice and the service was on point. \n\nWe ordered to share: \nGrilled Shrimp Tacos: I HIGHLY recommend these. It was the best thing I had out of everything. The shrimp was perfect not overly salty fresh and plenty. Came with green sauce and tomato sauce? both were good. \n\nMac N Cheese with pork shoulder: This was recommended by the waitress but it was quite disappointing (maybe it was just mine). First it's not your average creamy mac n cheese served in a skillet of some sort. Rather it was stacked together and dry. The cheese was powder like and the macaroni was mushy. The onion rings were bland and greasy. The pork shoulder was on the sweeter side which was fine but it was very dry too. The dish was very heavy. \n\nChicken and Pesto Flatbread: SKIP. This was very boring and dry. It tasted exactly as chicken cheese pesto on thin flatbread. The flavor was lacking. I had 2 bites and didn't bother with the rest. \n\nThe Rosie Lee tipsy tea: I would say skip this too. The presentation was beautiful but the cocktail itself tasted okay. I wouldve loved to try other drinks. \n\nThe bill came to about $72 for 3 entrees and 2 cocktails. I would say that's fair given that the portion of food was more than enough for 2 people to share. I had a nice experience but not sure if I want to return for the food." u'Brunch here was pretty damn good. No wait time around 3pm on a Saturday but then again the place is big with a huge bar spanning across 3/4ths of the restaurant.\n\nA live band was just wrapping up in the front otherwise the atmosphere was quieter than your typical brunch places (No dj spinning tunes no loud/boisterous drunk groups etc).\nThis place seemed more suitable for an intimate small group or a date.\n\nFood was good. I enjoyed the breakfast flatbread..fried eggs chorizo sausages and other seasonings adding to a delectable and filling meal. Honorable mention to the extensive cocktail options I enjoyed the recommendations from the waitress.\n\nOverall a solid restaurant with great drink options in a very touristy area. Highly recommend for your dining and drinking needs.' u"I'm not much of a drinker but I came here with a few friends we got the sing sing which is pretty much like a moscow mule. It was probably one of the best I've ever had. Came here at 10PM and it was very dim inside. Given that I have 4 eyes my eyes are already impaired so I was very dark inside. I guess it makes it that much more imitate but I can't have a good time if I can see what I'm enjoying. \n\nWith all the drinking we ordered the eggplant fries which was ridiculously good. It's very different from anything I've very had before. The texture is pretty much like any vegetable you fry. It's like a very soft chip. They drizzle the top with honey and that made it 10 times better. It also comes with a side of honey for dipping. I enjoyed the environment and the music wasn't too loud where you couldn't really hear what people are saying.\n\nRESTROOM LOCATION: Towards the back and down the stairs." u"This place is nice I give it that. It's way larger than it appears. Although this place is nice   I did not have a good experience at all.\n\nI found it extremely awkward at how close the tables were. I could hear everything the table next to us was saying; therefore I wanted to sit next to my boyfriend so I can have a private evening instead of across the table.  This place wasn't crowded enough where all the tables were taken but they  were so concerned about me taking up 2 tables that they made me move. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the lamb burger which was alright. His meat was really charred and overcooked.  \nI ordered the New York style pouting fries and they didn't taste good at all. I'm the type of person that always finishes my food or takes it home  especially fries (my fav food)! But I didn't even finish them nor take them home! My fries were so burnt; I was going to complain but by the time I had tasted it I had like 6 bites (every other other bite was burnt) I thought it was too late. Very disappointing!! \n\nI wouldn't come here again." u"Came here for brunch. Place was popping but there were still enough tables left so we were able to find seating pretty quickly. I ordered the avocado smash which was served with poached eggs and had chili sliced radishes which gave a lil bit of heat which was a nice surprise. Served with either a side of fries or salad. I got the salad which was nicely dressed. Probabaly could have used more tomatoes or nuts in it rather than just greens. \n\nWe also ordered the waterfront which is a drink for two people which sounds interesting (vodka watermelon tea). unfortunately I will not be trying again. I think they used an artificial watermelon vodka base b/c It literally tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher and it was too sweet with a bare hint of tea. \n\nPrice wasn't too terrible. For 2 dishes and one drink for two people was $50." u'Step into Narnia!! Everything about this maze of a place was perfect! A huge place with different levels and areas throughout depending on your mood!  \nSome of the best craft cocktails music ambience and really really good wings paired with the downstairs bar had me feeling all the feels! I\'m looking forward to going back very soon! It\'s just a  cozy intimate spot! I\'m a fan yes I am! \n Prices of cocktails were abt $15 each service was 5 stars easily! Oh and the bartender told me "we close whenever the last person leaves" they have no set closing time!!!' u'Stumbled into Tanner Smith after a quick Yelp search and I was not disappointed! \n\nMy mother-in-law and I met for a late dinner and the place was packed! Regardless of the crowd we were sat immediately. The dim lighting and warm tones really set the mood. But the energy and activity from all the other tables around us created a nice balance. Not too romantic for a quick dinner but not too divey. The crowd was definitely on the late 20s early 30s end. \n\nCome here if you want new twists on old favorites. The menu features traditional American with a culinary flare. I opted for the Brussel Sprout Hash topped with two fried eggs and dill cr\xe8me fraiche. So delicious!\n\nI kept it pretty vanilla and only drank wine but the cocktails being ordered around me looked great.' u'Brussel sprout hash was huge and delicious! Mimosas are wonderful. Staff is helpful and polite and the band was such a fun way to enjoy brunch. Will def be back.' u'Really loved everything about this cocktail bar!\nVery cool interior and wide range of drink options.\nWhat the dr. Ordered totally caught be by surprise. The cocktails are all made with fresh and unique ingredients.' u"This was a hard call between 3 or 4 stars. The pros are that it has a nice atmosphere is pretty spacious and has a solid cocktail selection. The cons are that it's midtown so can get pretty crowded quite early and your mos def paying midtown prices... not that bad at $14/16 a drink about the median for cocktails in the city but still not walking out of here without dropping $50 for just drinks.\n\nIn the end the tasty drinks make up for the crowds and price point." u"The customer service here is AMAZING. Came for a Sunday brunch close to 1 and the hostess told us it'd be a 20 minute wait. After we gave her our phone number and was about to look for another place the hostess chased after us to let us know there was a table that just opened up.\n\nWaiting for food is super quick. I feel like most brunch places in the city take 20-30 minutes but I swear my order came out in 15. I ordered the baked eggs which was super delicious. However if you're sensitive to spice I recommend not ordering it. It's not super spicy but definitely you get a good kick in your mouth." u'Came here for brunch- they said the wait was 30 min but we were seated in about 15-20. You put your name and number down - they will text you when the table is ready. \n\nWe got the tipsy tea combo brunch - $40 and comes with your choice of tipsy tea or cocktail or mimosa entree and dessert. \n\nI got the rosie lee tea -- gin flavor- light and refreshing. My friend got the bourbon tea- I would recommend getting this one. It tasted better in my opinion but I like dark liquor. \n\nFor my entree I got the avocado smash- they could put more avocado on it but it was filling. It comes with poach eggs on the top. I like the mustard/cheesy sauce they gave with my fries. \n\nCute place - vintage vibes and friendly service!' u"This place was delicious! Atmosphere is dark and it is pretty loud probably better for smaller groups or 1 on 1 time where it is more personal. Maybe good for a first date spot? There was a couple making out hardcore on the couches in the basement when we were leaving :)\n\nWe were able to get a reservation in downstairs where they accommodated our group of 9.\n\nThe cocktails were hit or miss with the group on tasting. Some were hit and some were miss but our waitress was ever so kind and understanding if it was one we didn't like.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious personally I liked everything on the menu. The mini lamb sliders were delish pretzels were good and the nachos were insane! You can pretty much get anything and not be disappointed." u"I stayed at Moderne down the street for a bachelorette this weekend and the brunch plans were up in the air Yelp to the rescue! \n\nWe were there on a Saturday and they had a live jazz band playing that kept shouting out our bride! Super sweet and she loved the attention. The music was the best back drop for their quaint rustic bar. Lighting was dimmed and you just felt like you were in another era. The decor was very rustic chic and awesome spot for brunch girls night even a casual date.\n\nI had the Salmon Eggs Benedict me a Bloody Mary. Both were delicious. My Eggs Benedict was very filling as well. Great portions. Our server Sara was very accommodating and attentive. She even brought us out comped deserts for the bachelorette: chocolate popsicles and mini carrot cakes both were damn delicious. \n\nThe bathrooms were clean and making your way to them is so cool. You feel like you're in a speak easy! Next time I'm in midtown again I will make my way back here!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
162.Café Zaiya,[u"Every time I come into the city via Grand Central Station I make it a priority to stop by for the green tea and black sesame swirled soft serve.  This is by far my favorite place to get these two flavors.  Both flavors are very pronounced which has been hard to find in Manhattan.  The ice cream is swirled quite precariously onto the cone so make sure it is sturdy and steady before walking away from the counter.  I have had one cone fall immediately after receiving it but the employee was able to make me a new one free of charge.\nI haven't tried any of their other food items but there appears to be a lot of quick meal options if you are on the run.\nFor me I'll stick to the swirled ice cream." u"Not bad.\n\nThis place is known for getting lunch items on the go in midtown and to that end it achieves its purpose pretty well. It can get super busy in here during lunch time and it can be a little bit difficult to find a seat during the peak hours. The line can also look a little daunting here but it goes by quickly enough. \n\nActually speaking about the line itself it sometimes seems like this place doesn't have a proper line. There have been many times that people have cut in front of me so I think you should be a little assertive and stand as close to a register as possible and signal that you have your food and are ready to pay once you have everything in order.\n\nThe last time I was here I got a katsu sandwich and an onigiri along with a croquette. This place. The onigiri was fine as was the katsu sandwich nothing really special about them. The croquette on the other hand was a little tasteless. It didn't really have a curry taste or a beefy taste nor did it taste very deep fried either. It was closer to a grilled potato than it was to a deep fried potato.\n\nAnyhow I would come back here again but only if I was in the right area. Otherwise I don't think it's worth a special trip here." u"I love that midtown has a bunch of japanese stores scattered everywhere! Cafe Zaiya has a food stand a bakery with breads and cakes and an ice cream stand all inside with seats to eat! \n\nCame here around lunchtime for the matcha/sesamea swirl and for one of their udon dishes.\n\n4/5 The ice cream is REALLY GOOD. I've always had overpowering matcha and overly sweet sesame and i don't know how they did it but the flavors were so well balanced and authentic they just worked really well together. It's a little pricey but it's definitely perfect to share. I highly recommend it at least once!\n\n3/5 I got their udon noodles to go which they packaged well for me. The noodles were yummy and the soup was pretty good though to be honest it tasted like something I could make from an instant ramen package. Good if you're in a hurry for your lunch hour and craving something japanese though! \n\nThe prices here are a little steep compared to some other Japanese lunch places so I don't come too often." u"I was around the neighborhood & happened to stop by this place. I mostly came for the ice cream judging it based on how it looked on yelp. Unfortunately it tasted Very fishy!! I got the green tea and black sesame swirled. I didn't taste like how it's suppose to. It was very strong and bitter and smelled like sushi ! \n\nI also got the Mango slushy Bubble tea with leeches & oh it was sooooo delicious!!! 100% 5 star on that!" u"This cafe has a little bit of everything. When you first enter on the left side they have the soft serve ice cream cream puffs and beverages. On the right side it's a bakery with dozens of different pastries to choose from. Near the back of the store there's regular food like bentos onigiris and sandwiches. It has a good variety of things to choose from.\n\nMy mission was to come and get the soft serve. My friend got the matcha and black sesame swirl where as I only got the black sesame in a cup. The matcha was good but the matcha flavor was very light and same goes for the black sesame. The soft serve at Matcha Love at the Mitsuwa food court in California has a stronger matcha and black sesame which I prefer. Nonetheless this is still delicious but I'll stick with my food court ice cream." u"Nestled in between Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library this spot is great to stop into on almost any day and grab a guaranteed dessert to share. I've come here several time but this is actually the first time I've been able to write a review for it! Regardless it's almost a prefect experience every time.\n\nOne again I opted for the extremely well known matcha & black sesame ice cream swirl. I was meeting a friend to catch-up and I though of no better place to get a convenient dessert to share in the Bryan Park area.\n\nThe only note I would make is for staff to clean the tabled area a little bit more frequently. Upon arriving I sat in a broken stool and almost immediately discovered a sticky counter top that hadn't looked like it been cleaned in a few hours.\n\nOverall this place is great and I'll be sure to come back most likely sooner rather than later!" u"Came in here for dessert and coffee with my family and had a major accident happen because the worker that made our coffee didn't close one of the coffee cups all the way! A piping hot cup of coffee spilled all over my leg leaving a very large burn that eventually turned into a very large nasty looking blister... We informed the workers about this and they seemed very complacent. Lucky for me there was a very helpful customer that assisted me in covering up my injury. Even before this incident happened the workers all seemed very loss and was passing me back and forth between each side of their store to order...\n\nFood wise we got the matcha black sesame swirl and they were delicious! After the spill they made us a new cup of the Americano we ordered and sadly it didn't taste good or fresh.\n\nSo if you're craving ice cream/froyo I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. If you need coffee I'd recommend going elsewhere but if you do end up buying coffee here PLEASE make sure they close their cups securely before they hand you the drink. The cups itself are hot so imagine how hot the coffee inside is :/" u"I got the matcha soft serve and it was amazing! I tried the Taiyaki matcha and sesame swirl and didn't like the mix so for here I got the regular matcha. I love it! I'm definitely going to go back and bring more friends to enjoy it with. \n\nWe got lost on the way and ended up at the bookstore version of this place by Bryant park. We eventually found this actual store...\n\nI didn't have a hard time finding seats. I checked out the cakes the cream puffs (I really wanted to try one but for $3.50 a cream puff i'd have to slap myself) and the sushi and various boxes of food. Due to poor reviews about the sushi even though it looked really good I held myself back and didn't get it. I stuck to what I was confident about and only got the matcha soft serve. \n\nThe place is clean looking. It looked a little bit run-down but the quality of the matcha soft serve was great. Super creamy mlem...mlem...rich but not over-powering matcha flavor. 10/10" u"5 stars for ice cream! The best spot for green tea or sesame (or both!) ice cream in NYC =)\n\n3 stars for food. I mean it's good but not great. They do have a wide variety - bento boxes sandwiches pastries sushi cakes... Cakes and pastries tend to be on the light side as the Japanese don't like heavy flavors. (And I learned I prefer Western sweets)\n\nThis is a nice casual spot to get average food and spectacular ice cream. It's great that they have pretty good seating as places at this price point usually only have seating for 5 people lol." u"I was excited when I saw they had mochi donut I went to this cafe twice and they always sold out. I had mochi donut before somewhere in Arkansas and it was awesome and chewy inside but this donut in cafe zaiya wasn't like that at all it didn't have the mochi texture that I expected. Basically it was more like a churro donut. I still like it more than a normal donut but they shouldn't call it mochi :|\n\nI got some small pastries like a red bean mochi a cream cheese danish and a matcha roll cake. All of they tasted delicous especially the danish. \n\nPrice is reasonable and they have a lot of choices. I would come back again to try more food here :)" u"This shop has so many food options for any time during the day. They have the Asian Curry plates sushi boxes various Asian sweet breads and rolls cakes pastries cookies and best of all their soft serve ice cream.\n\nI tried the green tea soft serve and it was fantastic they really pile it up. The flavor is great not too sweet and just right. \n\nDidn't try any of the food so can't comment on that. The place is very clean with indoor sitting. The staff is very cordial and helpful.\n\nDefinitely a place to try again in future." u"Probably closer to 3.5 stars because of the price of $4.50 per soft serve. Sugar cone is +.25 cents more.  I only tried the matcha/Taro and was good.  It was tasty but I wouldn't mind a little stronger favor. Overall on a 85 degree day this hit the spot.\nIt's midtown price (lol)" u'Shrimp burger is usually my go-to lunch but I was really dissatisfied this time. After taking a bite I saw that the shrimp was uncooked. It is lucky that I even looked at my burger.... I hope this will not lead to food poisoning....' u"I got their sesame green tea swirl. I try not to consume dairy but I couldn't help myself. This just looked sooo good. My mom & I had shared one. It's really filling. They give you a lot. The sesame is more creamier. My mom & I both prefer the green tea flavor. It's light and refreshing. Customer service was really nice. They asked if I wanted a cone or cup. I said cup because it's easier to walk and eat while not getting messy. I'm a usually a pretty messy eater and I 9/10 times almost always drop something on my shirt dress & clothes. This place wasn't that hard to find. They have a lot of pastries and bread dessert like wrapped food items. They also sell both cold & iced coffee & tea here." u"Cafe Zaiya has 3 locations in NYC. I go to all three of them. This location is the busiest. It's always packed with customers during lunchtime on weekdays. It is more chilling on the weekends. It offers a variety of bento lunch boxes pre-packaged riceballs pastries loaves of bread steamed buns cream puffs and other desserts. My favorite is their green tea and black sesame soft-serve ice cream." u"Elton W's review nails the identity-crisis issues with this business spot on so I won't get into it. The service has major issues too. Came in for a simple boba drink and one of their much-hyped soft serve cones but almost left empty-handed because AFTER PAYING they said they were out of boba and soft-serve.\n\n When I asked why my order was taken for items I couldn't have I didn't receive an apology but I did get a bomb coconut frappe and my cone- after watching the guy crank out two more for the Asian couple ahead of me then a twist cone that he dropped!! and then the one I ended up getting. Forreal?! It was super tasty and well priced at $4. I have no idea why green tea and black sesame soft serve aren't more popular but given the multitude of services issues it seems obvious why this cafe isn't.\n\nTIP: Stay open later to get the post-show crowd from the surrounding theaters." u'It was a $4.25 well spent!\n\nI\'m solely basing this review on their soft serve icecream. Got their green tea and  sesame soft serve on a cone and I immediately thought about Mitsuwa. I love sesame icecream from Matcha Love inside Mitsuwa in NJ and this one came pretty close. Some may like the grainy texture others may not. I personally don\'t mind the texture despite that it\'s a "soft serve." They\'re also very generous with the portion big enough to share. My friend got the milk tea and there isn\'t much to be said except that it\'s like.. your typical Hong Kong style milk tea. I also just remember freezing inside even more so since I was eating something cold but still.. I guess it was worth chattering my teeth through each lick. I\'ll definitely come back for their soft serve icecream especially for the sesame.' u'This review is for the soft serve only!\n\nThe matcha and black sesame swirl is my go-to soft serve as I work only a few blocks from here. They give you a towering cone of ice cream for a good value and the flavors of both come thru/blend together nicely. So creamy and smooth.\n\nThe interiors of this place is really just a cafe nothing super special about it with some pastries/bread in the middle and a few quick-eats options like udon and curry. \n \nBut the ice cream is always a reliable option and fulfills my craving every time!' u"This is my go to place whenever I'm craving match ice cream. Even though it's soft swerve it's probably the best matcha ice cream you can get in NYC. It's around $4.50 a cone but trust me this is so worth. Matcha lovers be on the lookout. This place is a little like a deli fast food kind of place but their stuff is just amazing. \n\nI order matcha cream puff and it was oozing with match fllling\n\nI usually order their cones matcha or sesame and matcha. And I love it love it." u"Black sesame soft serve ice cream - Best I've had in a long time. $4.50 but plentiful.\n\nMatcha green tea soft serve ice cream - Good matcha flavor. It rivals Matcha Love in San Jose.\n\nOther things - A huge variety of items from freshly baked pastries cakes cookies biscuits shaved ice and normal food (tempura udon beef bowls and sushi)."],0.7579,0.188,0.812,0.0
16.Burger & Lobster,[u"Came for a business lunch on Monday at ~12pm and had an enjoyable quick experience. The only annoying thing was that I wasn't able to make a reservation online via any reservation platform; had to email them (but that went smoothly). The service was fast and friendly. This place has burgers lobsters and lobster rolls with variations within these three menu items. \n\nWe started out with the burger bites and lobster bites which I would describe as spring rolls with burger and lobster fillings respectively. Pretty tasty. Then I had the Original lobster roll which came with a side of fries and salad. The lobster roll was great! Super tasty lots of good lobster filling and a nicely buttered bread bun. The fries were nicely fried and salted as well. The salad was doused in salad dressing though which I was less of a fan of. \n\nOverall good place for a tasty lunch in midtown!" u'The burger was quite good! And the fries were great as well. \n\nThe lobster was good but not amazing. I had a steamed 1 pounder as part of a meal that included lobster and a burger. The lobster was somewhat over cooked. \n\nOur waiter was very nice.' u"This place has really good lobster rolls. The service was top notch and is decently priced. I ordered the Seven Samurai Lobster Roll shared the Pounder and shared the lobster egg roll appetizer.  My friends ordered the Original Lobster Roll and the Lobster Po Boy. It was also someone's birthday so they brought out the chocolate mousse with candles.\n\nLobster Rolls: the seven samurai was very good. The sauce was very tasty and asian flavor oriented. The bread was soft and buttery and crispy on the outside lots of lobster in the sandwiches too. I had a bite of the Original and the Po Boy. They were great. I liked them better than mine. Can't go wrong with how basic and simple the Original was and the Po Boy had lots of flavor. The fries were cooked good and the salad was very tasty. Kind of like a balsamic flavor for the salad.\n\nAppetizer Lobster Egg Rolls: These were good. Just a lobster egg roll with sweet chili sauce.\n\nPounder: The lobster was cook perfect and the dipping sauce was so good. Got an extra side just to dip out fries. \n\nChocolate mousse: small sized and very tasty. It was rich in flavor too. Not too sweet." u"Believe the hype...\n\nFirst off it's pricey. But considering where we dined it's the going rate for restaurants around the Times Square/ theatre district.\n\n Our appetizer was the lobster bites with a sweet & sour sauce. Little nuggets to get our lobster fix started off.\n\nEntrees...\n\nThe po' boy was wifey's choice a cornmeal dusted lobster served in a buttery split top roll served up warm . Definitely very impressive. Not your dinky little roll. Have never seen one this big in the city before.\n\nI went with the very popular Spot light combo. A 6 oz burger( medium rare ) along with a 1 lb lobster steamed. That sauce is what set it apart in my opinion. A lemon garlic mixture that set my taste buds off. So much on my plate. Had a hard time finishing it off. \n\nDessert was offered up by our server but just had to decline. Now that certainly doesn't happen much. Seems to be somewhat new to the area. When we left they were lining up downstairs for a table.\n \nDo check out the tanks when you first walk in on your left. Say hello to the big boys." u'We came here Saturday night before our show.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30 pm and was told there was a 15 minute wait so we walked around outside until we got a text message/phone call.  All seating is upstairs and we were seated at a table.  In addition to regular bar seating and tables they have "communal tables" where people may be asked to sit together.  A restaurant should advertise this before a party sits down and becomes comfortable!\n\nOnce we were seated we were provided with water and menus.  The menu is straight forward just variations of burgers and lobsters.  We ordered the original lobster roll which comes with fries and salad.  The lobster roll was so sad to say the least.  There was no flavor in the lobster.  It was overdressed. The bun was cold.  The only saving factor were the sides! And on their own they are 3$ each.  Why would I spend 25$ on a meal if I only enjoyed 6$ of it? \n\nOn a positive note the bathroom is clean. The toilets and sinks are in the same area but they aren\'t as you need to come outside to wash your hands. Extremely hygienic! \n\nAll in all this was highly disappointing for us.  We will not be entertaining this restaurant again as we have also gone to their other location in Flat Iron and had a similar disappointing experience.' u'3.5 stars.\n\nInteresting decor for this spin-off of the Flatiron sister restaurant. Make a reservation on weekend nights because the place is packed... Being half block away from Times Square doesn\'t help. \n\nThere are currently 4 different lobster rolls on the menu but only the "Original" (priced at $25 $5 more than the other 3) has a good amount of lobster: about twice as much as the others. This roll is very good and comes with a generous amount of decent fries and a couple of bites of bland salad.\n\nDrinks are expensive ($9 for an average IPA) so don\'t get surprised if your check ends up being pricier than you expected. \n\nI would go back but would not order anything else other than the roll itself. They get you with the rest of the stuff. After all you\'re in tourism land.' u'3.5 stars if possible rounded down due to service. So Burger and Lobster has over 4000 reviews (other location). Came during a weeknight so didn\'t expect it to be packed but I guess because of the location close to Time Square looked pretty busy. You probably won\'t need a reservation on the weekdays. Sister ordered lobster roll and I got combo Burger and 1 LB lobster.\n\nLobster roll: At first glance looks like lots of lobster and very large however upon biting into it it wasn\'t all lobster but a mix of salad/slaw as well (~$20)\n\nComb ($35): Comes with a drink which they "forgot" until end of meal.\n\nLobster (1 lbs): Lobster was good sized however didn\'t seem to be that fresh as the meat didn\'t come out in one piece and had to dig in there for the meat.\nBurger: just a regular old burger. I requested bacon on the side but the bacon was soooo yummy ended up eating it all.\n\nOverall Food: for the quantity of food and the amount paid 4/5 stars.\n\nService: Hostesses were great but not getting a drink with the combo until the end since they forgot didn\'t sit well with me. Also water never refilled. Additionally when it came time to pay we handed card and waiter returned with the merchant cop and the customer copy receipt WITHOUT our card. Tried to flag him down but had disappeared. Didn\'t know where our card went. Sister had to run up to the waitress/waiter table to look for card which luckily was still stuck in the card reader.' u"The burger and lobster downtown ranks as one of my favorite restaurants in the city so when we were looking at heading to burger and lobster we found this one even closer to us! \n\nWe got the burger/lobster combo for $35 and the original lobster roll meal for $20. We had three people and this was beyond enough for us. We also got extra dipping sauces of truffle mayo chipotle mayo and lemon butter sauce (we ran out of the first saucer). \n\nThe lobster was perfectly grilled and delicious in the lemon butter sauce. The fries were crispy with dipping sauce. The burger was medium rare and juicy. One of the best burgers I've had in the city. The lobster roll fell short to me though there was a bit too much bread to lobster ratio and the extra bread on the sides had to be dipped in sauce.\n\nService was great with both the greeters on the bottom floor and the waiters on the 2nd floor being super friendly. Decor was nice as well kind of an urban garden meet industrial wall with diner-ish seats theme going on." u"Burger & Lobster is a fun and trendy spot for anyone looking for finger food. We visited the one in Times Square and that was a real treat. I love the atmosphere. Make sure to book a reservation if you're planning on going with a large party\n\nMenu is simple front and back and has several key dishes such as burgers lobsters and lobster rolls. There are also plenty of good drink options to complement all of this. Since we were a bit indecisive we went with the $200 tower of food \n\nOrdered (for party of 4) \n- $200 Tower (3.75/5) - Tower of food. You will get to pick 2 burgers 2 lobster rolls 2 lb of lobsters unlimited fries / salad and either cocktails or a bottle of wine. This is a bargain and perfect if you're looking to just go all in. You can grab any two burgers or lobster rolls regardless of price. This is a steal \n\nBurger and Lobster is one of those places that will bring back nostalgic crawfish experiences. Food is fairly good and the staff is excellent. I would go for the Tower since I like variety in my dishes but you will not go wrong with a lobster roll or burger" u"I haven't been to their first location but judging from the pictures I would describe this one as a bougier more upscale version. They have a full bar here so it's pretty lively even on a weekday night. Overall I don't think paying $20 for a burger or a one pound lobster is worth it at all - the only thing I would get here again is the lobster roll which is just a tad bit higher than the competition in the city for a lobster roll.\n\nThe 5 of us got there and we were quoted a 20-30 minute wait time. We agreed to wait and stood in the lobby area downstairs. 10 minutes later the worker right next to the one who we spoke to first asked us if we wanted to wait. Here I'm just thinking uh yea like why the fuck would we be standing here if we didn't want to wait? Plus we already confirmed that we wanted to wait for the seats.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after this the ORIGINAL person we spoke asked us if we wanted to wait? WHY ELSE ARE WE STANDING HERE IS YOUR MEMORY THAT BAD? He says that he needs our name and phone number for the seats (this was NOT something he asked for in the beginning). After giving them our information we were quoted a 45 minute wait time. WHAT? Turns out he forgot to enter us into the system - what an idiot. I'm sorry but you literally have one job to do PLUS they asked us 3 times if we wanted to wait for the seats and we said yes. \n\nWhen we were finally seated upstairs I noticed that the restaurant was only half full. I have NO idea what we even waited for as those other seats did not even fill up for at least another 30 minutes. We were promptly given our menus but we had to specifically wave down the manager (I presume) to get water and for someone to take our menu. It is not the managers job to get the waitress to take our menu - there is clearly some under-training/incompetence going on in here.\n\nI decided on the lobster burger to try to get the best of both worlds. At $30 this is a crazy expensive burger considering the meat is just regular meat and not wagyu/Kobe like what I've paid for in other places. I specifically asked for medium rare.\n\nSalad - I actually enjoyed this. It's very lightly dressed and has balsamic vinegar on top which was a nice touch.\n\nFries - quite good actually almost like mcdonalds fries. Perfectly crispy but not too crispy and had some soggy fries which I kinda like actually lmao.\n\nLobster Burger - a bit disappointing to look at. The lobster has melted Swiss cheese on top with a scarce amount of garlic aioli. As you know when melted Swiss cheese hardens it has a waxy plasticy texture to it. I love Swiss cheese but it has a very distinct flavor to it and I think this completely overpowered the delicate lobster. \n\nThe biggest travesty of the night - my medium rare burger was cooked to a medium well - it was somehow even MORE COOKED than my friends who asked for medium. My burger even had the little plastic stick indicating it was supposed to be cooked to a medium rare - what the hell? I obviously complained to the manager - if I'm paying $30 for a damn burger you BETTER make sure it's COOKED TO ORDER. The manager agreed that it was not a medium rare and asked me if I wanted to wait for a new one or try something else. Not wanting to risk waiting for yet another disappointment I opted for the classic lobster roll because there's only so much they can burn the roll.\n\nThe lobster roll comes with much more bread than other lobster rolls I've had. However if you push the lobster down so the meat is more distributed throughout the roll it was actually a decent meat:bread proportion. The lobster was lightly seasoned and the bread was nice and crispy. \n\nOverall while the lobster roll was decent I don't see myself returning in the near future at least not for a few months. They seriously need to retrain their waiting and the kitchen staff because these are problems that should never happen especially when you're paying a premium for a simple product." u"I had burger & lobster in London yet I would say this is a better experience. The food portion is really huge and that doesn't make the quality any less. The steamed lobster is juicy and fresh perfect with garlic lemon butter. Burger is just about right and delicious. The salad is finally not coleslaw and it's a pretty decent salad with balsamic dressing. I do complain about the smell of weed when we started eating but it went away soon." u"Stopped by with the parents on a Thursday for lunch. \n\nLoved the whole decor and atmosphere of the place. Bring it be a weekday most of the diners were in business attire and on their lunch break. But since there's a bar area you can come either solo or with a group. \n\nOur waiter was super nice. I ordered the original lobster roll and an IPA. While I was waiting I scoped around what other people were having and it was a good mixture. At one table everyone was eating whole lobsters...and at another everyone was eating burgers and rolls. Just shows prob everything is good. \n\nWhile I was waiting a lobster shell piece slid done my back while a server was discarding the plate...unfortunately he didn't notice but my parents noticed my  face. Lol.\n\nOnto the food...the roll was yum! There was plenty of meat and it was fresh. They didn't overflow the thing with dressing and sauce so it made everything so much better. And the bread...mmmmm. Oh and the salad...I really liked it. Looking at the whole thing you may think...oh man I prob will still be hungry afterwards but nope! \n\nMy dad got The Beast. He liked it but will order lobster and burger separately next time. He said individually they were delicious (he was raving about the juiciness of the burger) but maybe not the best match when placed together. The flavors were fighting each other because both were so good! \n\nOverall we all liked it. Is it a pricey lunch? Yes. But worth it? Duh!" u'Starting off with the positive. The staff was great. Especially Heather our waitress. She had a bubbly personality! And yes the lemon garlic butter is delightful.\n\nNow to keeping it 100%. The objective of the founders is to perfect these 2 ingredients: burgers and lobsters. Sadly to say they were just...okay (perhaps that\'s why isn\'t wasn\'t packed on a Saturday night) here\'s the bigger concern:\n\nMy dinner partner ordered the steamed 1.5lb lobster and myself the B & L combo steamed. The food came out quick! I took one look at his lobster and looked at my mine and noticed something very different. My lobster had "green stuff" (see definition below) all through out. Now this isn\'t the first time I\'ve had lobster by far and I hate to complain but today was the day. We got Heather\'s attention who explained that the "green stuff" (excuse my ignorance) was called Tomally and that it was normal/a delicacy ( sauce from lobster liver) and they could clean it off for me. Hmm yeah no mentally that wasn\'t going to sit well with me. She called the Manager Brendon over who was very nice and also offered to clean it off and re steam it. He said that they couldn\'t return it because all sales are final and we would be charged for 2 lobsters because they are expensive.\n\nDear founders: as much as tomalley may be a delicacy for some it is not for others. With that being said my suggestion is the server should ask if that is what the consumer likes before ibringing it out how YOU choose. \n\nBack to Brendon the manager. I was very adamant about not wanting the same lobster cleaned or uncleaned. He finally said it\'s up to the Chef at which he comes back and says the Chef agreed that it was a lot for that lobster. My food came back out and we were satisfied with that but in the end\n\nI\'m not sure we\'d come back. The 2 main stars were NOT PERFECTED like I was anticipating. Oh and $13 for a shot of Jamo?? :/' u"I'm already a big fan of Burger & Lobster from its 19th street location so when I noticed the stylized logo across the street from work I was ready to go! My co-worker and I came here at the start of lunchtime and were greeted by tanks of lobsters and a hostess who was very friendly. I think the lobsters were trying to greet us as well as I saw a meaty claw bob up somewhat. Obviously I waved back to the 'Big Boys' and you should too.\n\nShe proceeded to show us upstairs to the dining area which had a decked out bar and eventually opened up to the main dining area with a high expanse of space. Lo and behold there were hanging mobiles of lobster tails and claws. Very nice! I would like to see some hanging mobiles of cow though. Beef patties would be just silly.\n\nOur server was equally as friendly if not more so than the hostess and explained the menu. This particular location has a lot more options than its counterpart location in that it's not just the burger option lobster option or a combo of both but a whole slew of other tasty options.\n\nI decided to get the original lobster roll just to compare it to what I've tasted before and it did not disappoint. The lobster roll was on point with the lobster being whole chunks fresh and not at all stringy. The proportion of the mayo was not overwhelming either. The bun vessel was a split-top potato-bread roll butter grilled on both sides to perfection. It was somewhat crispy on the outside and divinely soft when my chompers made contact. A quarter lemon was provided to drown the lobster in acid and made a dichotomy of the sublime lobster. This is good eats people!\n\nMy co-worker decided to get the original burger and he royally proclaimed that it was the best burger he's ever tasted. Yes it's a subjective opinion but it looked super juicy. In fact the juice ran off and he proceeded to use his french fries in an attempt to use it as an au jus sauce. That's a free pro tip!\n\nGo here!" u"Had lunch at B & L last Sunday...\n \nAmbiance: Really nice...I prefer this location to the Flatiron location mostly because it's beautifully decorated. The living walls (if that's the correct term) are stunning. The restaurant was 75% full on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nService: Our server was friendly and food came out relatively fast. \n\nFood: Here's where we had problems...\n-- Lobster - two of us ordered the lobster and they were BOTH unbelievably chewy. Not sure why B & L can't figure out the problem with the chewiness and remedy this? I've had the same chewy lobster at the Mayfair London location and the Flatiron location. So obviously this is a problem.\n-- Burger - I didn't try this but it looked tasty although a bit small.\n-- Fries and salad were delicious.\n\nOverall: I keep trying to find a place that serves non-chewy lobster. Not sure if I'm being unreasonable here but B & L definitely isn't that place." u'Great place for some delicious and fresh lobster. I have tried the 1 pound lobster and original lobster roll. The lobster was delicious with their famous lemon and garlic sauce. It made the lobster just melt in your mouth and ooze with flavor. The original lobster roll was the one I was looking forward too but unfortunately I found it mediocre. I have had better lobster rolls. The bread was not buttered enough and just lacked a little kick to it. Both orders came either French fries and a side of salads. The salad I was definitely not a fan of. The ambience was nice and quiet. The staff was patient and friendly.' u"Who knew burger & lobsters go well together. \nThe burger bites is a must get. I got the Fiesta lobster roll it was alright.\nI still prefer Luke's lobster roll\nIf you have a big appetite I would suggest you to order the BEAST. it's a burger with lobster meat in it." u"Amazing food!!!!! Can't wait to come back again!!! I had the combo and was soo good. The drinks were great and the lobster bits were amazing as well. Service was great quick and very responsive." u"So.. i'm giving this place three stars because of one factor. Which is the restaurant is clean and the ambiance was pretty cool if it weren't for that sadly I would've only given this joint two stars. \n\nMy friends and I went to the 43rd street location to celebrate my friends birthday. Ive been wanting to try this place so I was really excited. The staff was friendly for the most part except for on server who was little... lets say pushy. She wasn't Our server the entire evening thankfully she took over for the other gentlemen before he left. \n\nThe menu was limited and there was much variation. I ended up getting the 1 pond lobster which came with fries and small cute salad. The lobster was over cooked and chewy and it lacked flavor. The fries and salad was cool. We also had the burger bites. The bites were flavorless as well and it accompanied by a weird tasting sauce. \n\nIn short it was an okay experience but I don't think I would be going back to that location. Perhaps Ill try the other which I hear has better tasting food to begin with." u"Being a carnivore sometimes a juicy burger or a good lobster roll is what I crave. Just like the name burger & lobster is litterally what you find in this establishment. \nWe got to the place on a Friday night in middle of time square and lucked out with waiting just 15 mins.\nAfter being seated at the hightop \nmeant for 4 we ordered shortly after. \nShortly after they sat another 2 people on our table. Waitress never said anything and just sat them. Ok..\nWe ordered the lobster bites & burger bites then 2 lobster rolls. One original & a Po boy.  Original was made with Japanese mayo which was very well seasoned. Po boy was ok. I've had better. \nThe bites....  waitress stressed that these were delicious so ordered both kind as recommended. The burger bites in fried rolls were delicious but the lobster bites were disappointing. \nLobster bites didn't have enough lobsters or shrimps (per description in the menu) instead was filled with egg filler in the texture of suffl\xe9. \nIt started to get busy by the time we were done. Getting the check took several waiving asking and trying to lock eyes with our waitress. \nOverall 3.5 stars but not looking to return anytime soon."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
139.Zoralie Restaurant,[u'Always great food. Family owned  good people!!!\n\nCan get very packed. The tre golpe is some of the best i have ever had! Try it' u"I haven't been personally to that restaurant but I ordered delivery once from there.\nThe food was delicious and authentic Dominican.\nThe prices are not expensive at all.\nThe Mofongo was amazing. It was my first time trying it." u"Zoralie.... where do I begin? \nI've been to this place about 4 times. Each and every time the food never disappoints. In my opinion it's one of the best flavored and seasoned Spanish restaurants I have ever been to. Ever! It's truly delicious and you can taste the freshness and attention to cooking. \nThe one and only issue with this place is that it's very small so if you're attempting to eat in it won't be the most convenient. I was there recently with 5 other people and a few of the table in the outdoor space were stacked up with old food left behind by the previous guest. We wanted to grab those seats to assure a spot for us to eat in but they were dirty and someone else had to ask one of the workers to clean it. \nI don't think that this was an intentional lack on the staffs end. Zoralie has such amazing food but severely understaffed. While you're there the phone rings non stop and you literally see the 2 or 3 people who are working hustling their butts off and trying to keep up with the demand. Unfortunately that's the only downfall from this place. Other than that the food is truly one of the best! My favorite from there is the garlic shrimp mofongo!" u"Mofongo de Pernil - $12\n\nMan this was good! Mofongo plate came with a salad rice and roasted pork. The nice gentleman at the counter gave a small bowl of broth that looked like au jus and he suggested we dip the mofonogo in there - BOMB. \n\nThe roast pork might be saltier for some so he suggested us squeeze some lime on top to balance it. He was right! Eff that's delicious! I definitely loved the homely feel and the genuine hospitality they displayed. We will certainly make our way back to Hell's Kitchen when we need the fixins'!" u'Zoralie Restaurant is literally a hole in the wall. They don\'t even have AC that works. But they serve some good Dominican dishes here. It looks like a family owned restaurant. \n\nThe people who work here are nice. The place is dark tiny and hot in the summer. Like I said the AC didn\'t work so dining in is pretty challenging. I guess that\'s what it feels like when you at at a random restaurant in the Dominican Republic.\n\nI got the Zoralie (pronounced "Zora Lee) special. It comes with mofongo maduros tostones shirmp in some butter sauce rice and salad with some avocado slices in it. It\'s a lot of food and cheap. \n\nThey have a cooler with various drinks including what it looks like traditional Latin American drinks. \n\nThe mofonogo was comforting and crunchy. I also liked their tostones. Their maduros were great too. I liked the entire dish overall. \n\nThe food is good the people are nice and the prices are reasonable. I don\'t recommend eating in though. Take it to go and enjoy the food in the comfort of your air conditioned place.' u"Zoralie is a small family owned restaurant with heart. \n\nI tried the pork shoulder and beef stew with rice beans and plaintains. \n\nIt was a cheap homey dominican meal. a place where after finishing i brought my plate back to the counter because that's what you do after a family meal or else you get la chancleta." u'The restaurant is a very small place. There is not plenty of seating area. Food is delicious. I order their mofongo which is one of my favorite dish and was really good. They have plenty of Latin food from rice to beans from pollo guisado to the amazing mofongo. Might not be the fanciest but the food is delicious.' u"Food is amazing. The people are friendly. The place is a bit dark but they have indoor and outdoor seating. Superb place to go eat with colleagues. I'd go if I were you." u"Wow! We found this little gem right in Hell's Kitchen.  I was looking for mofongo con chicharron and found them right here on Yelp.\n\nThese guys have a small kitchen but cook like a million bucks.  Some of the best mofongo con carne frita y chicharron I have had in a while anywhere in the world.  They also have lunch specials and if you are a local they deliver!  Just a short walk from the Theater District not a fancy place but the food will blow you away.  Menu prices are super affordable too." u"This is grandmas Dominican cooking at its finest. Let me share with you a few reasons why this place is the bomb! Let's start off with the most important thing besides taste the price is on point!!! $5 for large rice and beans or $3. For a medium size rice and beans mixed where can you get that in Midtown West?? Prices are so so reasonable. \n\nThe food is so on point!! It brings me back to my abuela making that big pot of rice and beans when the family is over. This is AUTHENTIC!!! I will definitely become a regular to this place. \n\nDelivery minimum is $8.\nStaff is friendly and helpful. \nIf they just made the interior more welcoming and renovated it would be a solid 5. Outside seating is very nice but the inside leaves you looking for more. It's so hot inside though that it's not worth sitting and eating inside. \nBesides seating this place really will bring you back to that Spanish heritage or will make you feel like your eating food from DR." u"LOVE THIS PLACE! It's my ultimate favourite spanish food spot in my neighborhood. The owners chef and servers are awesome always pleasant. Great family-run business. I've been going here since they first opened in Hell's Kitchen a few yrs ago. Great price for their lunch special $6.50 w/h by the way is an ALL day special...you can't beat that in this pricey location! Zoralie has daily menu specials as well.\n\nIt's a small place and they have a 'lil outdoor seating area that I like to come for summer lunch or dinner when I don't take my orders to go. I usually order for pick up or do delivery if I'm feeling lazy.\n\nI love the chicken white rice (or yellow) and beans w/ the sweet plantain on their lunch special. My kid always goes for the beef stew. We like to ask for the red onions (that are sitting in vinegar yum!) on top. Avocado salad and mofongo is pretty good there too. Sometimes I just order tostones on the side. In the winter I tend to go for their beef or chicken stew or if they have sancocho to warm me up. \n\nAsk for the Kimberly drink special that they always make for my daughter. That's when she mixes their lemonade w/ some passion fruit it's so delish and refreshing!\n\nEnjoy and hope you love this place like I do" u"This was one of the best Spanish meals I've ever had . The bake chicken  the beans  the plantains  the pepper steak are all 10/10. \nWhy not a 5 star review ? Well the worker opening the entrance to the basement which is oddly in the main eating space gave me a good blast of a nasty moldy scent during my meal . This added to the already dingy nasty looking carpets and less than 100% food bar and it took away from my enjoyment. Place has a lot of potential but I can imagine someone uppity walking out because of the appearance of this place . I did when they had the B grade afew months ago but I was glad to give them a try after the change to an A." u'Mofongo was huge disappointment! Dry and not good at all even with the sauce. We had chicken and pork mofongo. Both Dry tasteless. The pork itself and plantains were good.' u"Ah...I was really pumped about eating here but everything from start to finish was terrible.\n\nWhen I got there without giving me a glance the man put up his index finger at me and told me to wait while he had his eyes fixed on a TV show that the two other staff members were also watching. The place was EMPTY. And I waited for a good minute before saying I was only here to pick up my food that I clearly see is standing there on the counter. I was again SHUSHED!\n\nFinally they turned their attention to me and took another few minutes to understand that I had placed an order online and that my food was right there.\n\nStill I was excited for it due to the great reviews. I ordered the House Special with steak. Other than the plantains and rice because I was so hungry I barely touched the food. The steak was terribly dry and had an unpleasant texture and flavor. The rice was honestly only that addicting because it has so much oil in it. So disappointed.\n\nThere's still a part of me that says maybe I just ordered the wrong dish but it's one of the signatures there!! Yelp doesn't usually lead me astray but with Zoralie it did..." u"Huge tasty portions for cheap. That sums up Zoralie's food options. \n\nCan't go wrong here from the chicken to the pork to the mofongo. Portions are huge. though most of the room may be taken by rice. However as an example $7 for a huge piece of chicken a few plantains more than enough rice and some grilled onions is a steal." u"Thanks to the Hell's Kitchen Yelpers who pointed this authentic tiny Puerto Rican restaurant out as a must-eat!\n\nZoralie has multiple daily specials to choose from. I was torn between the Pepper Steak and Baked Chicken (Sunday) so asked the sweet petite server for recommendations. She suggested the chicken so I went with dark meat yellow rice and black beans (choices: white/dark white/yellow red/black/pinto [?]).\n\nThe chicken was so flavorful and moist: definitely worth the trip alone! The rice was bland though but the beans were good. A few slices of plantain were included and those were good as well.\n\nThe menu listed the special as $10 but my bill was $7.25. Seriously?! Even better!\n\nZoralie is a total win for a hearty Puerto Rican meal!" u"Caught an uber here while I was in NYC. I was craving some Dominican cuisine and wanted some chicken and rice. Came here with a friend; decided to order Baked Chicken (pollo al horno) pepper steak (bistec salteado). Chicken Stewed (pollo guisado) sweet fried plantains (tostanes o maduras) and the yellow rice (arroz amarillo). My friend decided to order the mashed green plantains (mofango).\n\nIt's small inside but a whole lot of love in the food. Sometimes big things come in small packages. The portions were hearty and the food was authentically amazing. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and tender as bubblegum. The pepper steak literally melted in your mouth in your mouth and the chicken stewed was absolutely delish. All of the food was absolutely mouthwatering and the service was A1. I will definitely be back when in NY again" u"This restaurant is in Hell's Kitchen and it's super casual so don't expect anything fancy. I usually get their Dominican breakfast (mashed plantains fried eggs fried cheese and sausage). The food IS VERY GOOD and inexpensive. Staff are friendly and professional. You can also have your food delivered but expect about an hour wait time." u"5 stars hands down. How can you not love a restaurant like this!?? \n\nThe place is very tiny maybe 3 tables so if you're with a big group I suggest take out. Don't let the size of this place fool you my boyfriend and I were having dinner around 8 and people would not stop coming in picking up their to go food! \n\nWe ordered breaded chicken (comes with your choice of rice and beans) a Cuban sandwich & 2 canned drinks came out to $23!  Love it. Give it a try!" u'The food was delicious and reasonable priced. I got rice and beans with roasted chicken and avocado maduros & tostones. I love the outside seating also. I cant wait to revisit this place and eat here again'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
111.Juniper,[u"We had heard good things about this place so we decided to book a reservation before we headed to a knicks game. We were able to book our reservation on Yelp which made things SO EASY! We showed up 15 minutes before and they were able to take us to our table right away. We had the SWEETEST server ever named Katy C. They have a nice wine beer and cocktail selection. The boyfriend was very pleased to find Coors light bottles (lol). We ordered the calamari lobster tacos and napa chicken sandwich. \nThe calamari was probably some of the best calamari I have ever had. Was not rubbery in texture at all and the sauce they drizzled on top was to die for! The sauce they served with it tasted like peanut butter to me and I didn't find that it complimented the calamari very much. No worries we ordered an extra side of the sauce that was drizzled on top. \nThe lobster tacos were not my favorite... I hate to say that! I love all tacos but these were not worth the $19 dollar price tag. \nMy boyfriend felt the same way about the chicken sandwich. He said it was good but he probably wouldn't order it again. His fries were delicious though!\nOverall we loved the ambiance of the place and every employee we came into contact with was very warm and sweet. I would also travel back here just for the calamari alone!" u'We were scoping out a Sunday happy hour in this area of town (in easy proximity to Madison Square garden) and came across this place. Online it said happy hour all day Sunday but it may have only been time limited (4-7) so call ahead and ask if you are going on a Sunday. We got there at 4 so perfect timing regardless. \n\nSpecials included $6 wines of all kinds and $6 beer or a gin cocktail. However the beer special was just one of their drafts a pumpkin ale so we skipped it and stuck with prosecco. \n\nThe food menu was a bit overpriced so we decided to wait and eat elsewhere. Not many vegan or good vegetarian options- more of a traditional slightly upscale bar menu. \n\nBar itself is very long and the space is long  and narrow. It is pretty and tastefully decorated and there are not too many tables a lot of seating is at the bar though you can call ahead for a seated table. \n\nOverall liked this place for an affordable drink before our concert and will come back if I am in this area again.' u"Juniper is a great spot for after work drinks and food.\xa0I love this place for drinks and small plate dishes during happy hour. Bar staff is friendly and makes you feel welcome. It is definitely worth walking couple of blocks from Penn Station.\n\nI've been to Juniper many times and have enjoyed their happy hour and regular menu items. I highly recommend the truffle fries polenta sticks pizzas and sliders. They also offer an expansive menu of cocktails and wine. The staff is very efficient during rush hours attentive and friendly. I definitely recommend Juniper for large and small gatherings.\n\nHappy hour prices continue through out the weekend as well! Over all It's a great place to stop before a night out in the city." u"Great happy hour drink specials (hellooooo $6 prosecco!!!) friendly service and good food. Can't beat that after work!!!" u"Came here on a Saturday evening with a group of 8 friends for a birthday dinner. The decor of this place was really nice and so was the music they were playing. At just the right volume to enjoy it and have conversations with friends. \n\nI had the gin old fashion and manhattan which I really enjoyed. The cocktails are priced at around $15 so it's not the cheapest. The sangria was not good so I wouldn't recommend that. Service was fine as well got a couple of the orders wrong and our waitress either seemed too sarcastic or was not having the best night with us. Felt like we were annoying her and we weren't even that needy. \n\nOn to the entrees the food was mediocre at best. I split the mini burger sliders Lobster Mac and cheese and lobster tacos. All were lacking something and was the quality of a chain restaurant. I would put them even a notch below houlihans and chilis. Food was really underwhelming. \n\nThis place has the potential to be great if their food was up to par with the ambiance of the restaurant. \n\nWouldn't recommend coming here." u"Happy Hour is from 4-7. My Boyfriend and I got there at around 2:30 so it wasn't quite happy hour yet. Don't they know that some people have summer Fridays and need some drink specials?!\n\nAnyway Juniper wasn't a bad experience. We wanted a small bite to eat before an early dinner so we opted for the sliders and the Vietnamese-style wings to share. For the sliders you can do can do any combination of three of the following: Mini Burgers (with american cheese & sauteed onions) Crispy BLT Chicken Sliders (pepper jack cheese applewood smoked bacon boston lettuce tomato chipotle aioli) or Crab Cake (fresh crab meat bibb lettuce plum tomato spicy remoulade sauce). We went with two chicken and one crab. They were okay - tasted like something you could get from Costco so I don't think it was really worth the $15. The wings were not bad. They were made with hoisin sauce but had a little too much sauce so it was pretty salty.\n\nIf I come back it would only be for drinks during happy hour." u"Came to Juniper for drinks in the city as my last stop with my girlfriend. We were looking for a place close enough to penn so we wouldn't have to worry too much about getting back. The place was fairly empty for the time we got there and I was kind of worried they might have been closed. We sat at the bar and the bartender Cameron helped us. He made these really good watermelon drinks and we ended up ordering some food. The food was really good and totally hit the stop. The calamari was particularly good. \nI was kind of surprised this place wasn't busier. I the food was good the drinks were good and the staff was friendly. I would totally come here again when I need to be close to penn but wanted a bit or a drink." u"I have been to Juniper a few times now since it's close to my work and they have a really great happy hour.  But I think I gave them enough chances and the good happy hour deal isn't worth it anymore.  The bartenders are so so rude.  Every time I would order a drink you'd think I insulted them. For this to happen 3 separate visits I am shocked to not see more bad reviews.  It's almost laughable how rude they are.  Anyways I am seeking out a different work happy hour going forward." u"I was vacationing here in NYC wanted something to pregame before Bruno Mars Concert and Found this place on yelp!!! Of course wasn't surprised by the stars they received. It's an awesome upbeat atmosphere with good food and great service. Came here because of happy hour specials and near Madison Square Garden. \nReally loved the music they played very hip and makes you just want to stay. \nThe steak tacos could have been better it wasn't that great.\nThe Philly cheesesteaks was awesome and tasty.\nCrab cakes was delicious \nCalamari was on point \n\nThis is a place to go if you want to hang out with friends and have a good time.\n\nI'll be coming back soon" u'The food was great they are not able to handle GF requests which is not as readily avail in NYC as it is in CA go figure! However they were gracious about asking were quickly available to serve and food came out quickly and we all loved our orders (btw the brussel sprouts were a huge hit as an appetizer at our table). \n\nNice wines tasty even though limited they made good decisions on their choices. \n\nI think the only downside was the very high noise level- the bar is fun good place to mix it up but realize that the dining area is not super warm or inviting and very loud from the bar and the noise from upstairs (not sure if dining or what was up there) but the food area has no modifications to account for the very loud sound level. \n\nGreat servers and service good food good wine- nice place but would not go back due to noise level.' u"Made a reservation for a party of 8 at 7pm. A few of us got here earlier and made the happy hour which ends at 7. The music by the bar was way too loud for us to have a conversation. We thought about going to a different restaurant but decided to stay since the music wasn't as loud in the dining area. \n\nWe ordered the truffle burger salmon burger pan roasted chicken and black sea bass with a pitcher of sangria. The truffle burger with roasted shiitake mushroom was delicious and the truffle fries on the side were really tasty. We all liked our food but it might be because we waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out- we were so hungry!! I would've liked to come back and try a different burger if the music wasn't so loud and the service was quicker." u"I was around the neighborhood and decided to stop by with my friend for a quick bite. We were seated fairly quickly since we passed the lunch hour rush. Per our server's recommendations I got the Big Blue Burger and my friend got the Lobster Club. Both come with the choice of fries or salad. It was a delicious and extremely hearty meal.\n\nI've heard good things about Juniper for happy hour so maybe I'll come back after work hours next time!" u'Love this place for HH! Carmine the bartender is great and he treated us like royalty!' u"Juniper is a pretty cool bar it's kinda like other Irish pubs in the area but has a more refined look to it.\n\nThe burger they have is similar to others found in the area but again just a slight edge. Now the place itself was superb clean open great decor.\n\nThe staff was welcoming and efficient. The bartender chose the burger for me (big plus when someone working there actually suggests what's good). \n\n4/5 because of price. 20.00 for a burger and fries. 25% - 5.00 more than others around. That slight edge isn't really worth the money.\n\nThat being said I didn't regret it. Maybe if it was bigger or had more fries something to merit the price I would've gave it a 5/5.\n\nIt's a cool spot not on the top of my list but I can see myself coming here with friends." u"Looking for a central spot to meet up with some work friends and this place fit the bill. The location is perfect. For me driving into the city the Lincoln Tunnel was only a few blocks away. For my friends Penn Station was right around the corner.  \n\nHappy Hour specials run until 7pm during the week. The specials are limited to the bar area seating only and include wines and Sam Adams no food. We decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour specials. There was a good size crowd on a Thursday night but service was on point.  \n\nThe menu was creative and everything we ordered was really good. Dishes hovered around the $15 price range. Some slightly more and some slightly less. \n\nI liked that they had the front window completely open taking advantage of the nice weather. The one thing I didn't love was the super loud music. It was kind of hard to have a conversation without screaming at each other. \n\nGreat service great food/drinks...definitely go!" u"What a great find!!!!!\nNice atmosphere \nGreat crowd \nAnd the best hostess - ask for Amena!!! \nAll tables were reserved and bar was a little crowded. Amena noticed me standing around and asked if she could help me. I told her i was meeting my boyfriend for one or two drinks but then we would need to head out. She Saud oh let's get you a table - I said they are all reserved. She said they are fully sold out (Billy Joel was performing at MSG) but for an hour it would be her pleasure to seat us. Such amazing service. I will be coming back to this great find" u'The waiter took 20 minutes to even take our order. We waited for over 50 minutes to get our food. When we asked how much longer our food would take the waiter said he would ask and disappeared. We later found out there was a problem in the kitchen but it was unreasonable that no one bothered to tell us that. \n\nWe ended up leaving because we were going to be late for our show. The manager did give us our drinks free of charge as an apology but it was honestly too little too late. One of the people in our party never even got water or utensils. The drinks that we did get were fine but the service itself was horrendous.' u'Had a great sunday happy hour selection. Perfect way to spend my last few hrs in the city. $6 wines. I did not try any food.' u"I came across this place by searching for HH bar in the area.  It's close to the Wyndham New Yorker where I am staying within walking distance. Great HH til 7:00 pm with selected drink items for $6.00. There's music playing in the background which isn't too loud.\n\nAs far as their food menu it's a bit pricey however great selections of items to select from prices ranging from $12 and up depending on your food choices. I recommend the Vietnamese wings; very tasty.\n\nI rate 4 stars and recommend this location if you're in NY and is staying in this area." u"We came here late one night and were seated right away. Service was prompt the entire time. I ordered a watermelon cocktail which was light and even more lightly sweetened which I enjoyed. We ordered the truffle fries light on the parmesean and the vietnamese wing. The truffle fries came out soggy but we enjoyed the taste so we ordered another order and asked them if they could make sure it wasn't soggy this time. Second order came out less soggy but they forgot to go light on the Parmesan. The vietnamese wings were well cooked but really sweet. It was all in all an okay experience but I probably wouldn't come again."],0.1154,0.108,0.892,0.0
27.Bugis Street Brasserie & Bar,[u"This place is consistently fantastic! It's nestled away inside of the Millennium Broadway hotel. You have to enter from 44th street and take a left into the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has always been on the dimmer side with ample seating. I have never had to wait during dinnertime on a Saturday. The wait staff is relatively attentive but at times can be a bit slow. \n\nMy absolute favorite dish here is the Singapore Laksa. It's very creamy with a flavorful and aromatic coconut soup base. The level of spiciness was perfect for the dish - it wasn't overpowering but strong enough to taste throughout the meal. The dish also comes in two sizes small and large. The small comes with the pre fixe dinner. There's also the option to order either size off of the regular menu. The laksa also offers generous portions of shrimp and chicken. The rice noodles are also a nice firm texture even after being in the soup. \n\nI've also tried the a few other items from the menu as well.\n- Nasi Goreng: If you add all the side of spicy paste it can be a bit overwhelming. Overall this was very tasty and the texture of the dish was great. Similar to the Laksa there is a variety of protein and vegetables in the dish. \n- Sweet Corn Soup: The soup is relatively light in flavor. It's a nice way to start off dinner. \n- Junior's Cheesecake: I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but people always rave about Junior's. It comes topped with a berry compote that was very sweet.\n- Warm Chocolate Lava Cake: Anything with chocolate tastes good to me. The lava cake came out hot with a side of vanilla ice cream. It didn't ooze like some lava cakes do but had a nice rich flavor to it. The vanilla ice cream was very thick as well and complemented the cake quite well.\n\nOverall great food (especially the Laksa!)." u"We received a gift card from a Singaporean event that was worth $60 for lunch however we strongly believe that they did not honor the full amount to our bill. We came in a group of 4 ordered the pre-fixe menu which was 28 dollars each + 2 drinks which was $6 on top. That is $118 total considering that they've included around 8% tax that would be $127.44 without tip then minus 60. You divide that by 4 that's 16.84 without tip. However each of our bill came out to be around $22 without tip. Sounds fishy right?\n\nThe business management team is horrible not only did they take 15+ minutes to figure out the gift card and manage to mess it up the servers were definitely not well trained. It was such an awkward experience. Our waiter was trying really hard to be nice though.\n\nThe food on the other hand was pretty good for the pre fixe I got the following:\n1) Chicken satay - the satay sauce was not really authentic but the chicken was really tender and moist it was cooked nicely and they give big chunks of chicken.\n\n2) Laksa - asked for it to be a little less spicy the kitchen really tried to make it a little less spicy but sorta failed (haha) but I do understand the broth was prepared already. The noodles were cooked nicely they gave 2 big pieces of shrimp lots of tofu and lots of fish balls \n\n3) cheese cake - I asked for something that's not chocolate (usually it'll be chocolate) since I hate chocolate. They honored my request and it was nice of them. \n\nThis place has potential to be a lot more they just need to manage their people a little better. Oh we did call in to make a reservation. Luckily we needed to change the time so we called back but learned that they didn't even take note of our reservation the first time." u'FYI: Review NOT based on food but poor business management. Reason for not being on food is because they canceled my reservation the day before I was confirmed to go.\n--\nSo I made a reservation at this place on OpenTable 5+ days before going and REALLY WANTED TO TRY / LIKE this place.\n\nHowever I get a call the day before on how they cannot honor the reservation because of an issue with their OpenTable system (even after I get a text asking me to confirm that I\'m still coming). All I get is a verbal "sorry" (that seemed highly unemotional and not genuine). And an offer to come super early at 5 but get kicked out by 6:15 OR sit in the lounge at 7 and get a random appended menu.\n\nWhy should your customers suffer at the expense of your poor management skills? There are plenty of ways to fix this problem that you\'ve had for MORE THAN 5 days namely working with OT (via phone) immediately after you know the system is down and displaying on the page that online reservation system is currently down and to call for reservations - so simple a method to ensure your potential customers don\'t have to be in a situation to scramble and make new reservations during PRIME DINNER TIME the night before.\n\nThe business should SHOW that they are sorry rather than just SAY they\'re sorry and leave a customer with no good alternatives / incentives to even come back to try the food. Don\'t blame someone else for your own poor skills and avoid taking responsibility. "Sorry for the inconvenience" doesn\'t cut it. "Oh we have to call 6 other people too with the same thing" also is not sufficient. Excuses SHOW me you don\'t care. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nI really wanted to try and love this place because it\'s hard to find authentic Singaporean food in NYC especially in midtown. However I have a gut feeling that if the host has poor customer service skills it may translate even worse to the rest of the staff.' u"Solid food. Good service. OK prices with smaller portions. We were able to get in and out in about 45 minutes. I wouldn't seek this place out but if I needed a quick easy quality place to eat before a show I would return. It's kind of hard to find- you definitely have to know it's there and go looking for it." u"Place was a bit tough to find; its inside the hotel as opposed to direct entrance from the street.  \n\nFood was good.   Could have been better but I would come back.   Ordered the pork ribs appetizer which was a bit disappointing.   The garnish was good but the meat was dry.  \n\n\nThe laksa dish was delicious.  What I would do to improve is switch from white meat chicken to dark meat chicken. \n\nFwiw I'm Singaporean so I miss good local food.   This reminds me a little of the local food.  Enjoy!!" u"We decided to go for Singapore food to get our fix. It was a good decision. The place is chic and yet cosy. We had the Nasi Goreng (fried rice) fried noodle curry chicken rice  laksa satay pork rib and crispy aromatic duck. They are very good and very close to the authentic street food in Singapore. Kudos! \n\nWe didn't try the desserts... maybe next time." u"I have been hunting for authentic Singaporean food in manhattan for years and many places I have tried were disappointing. The name caught my attention as my college and I were looking for a place for lunch. We both lived in Singapore for a period of time and we both agreed that the food is very authentic. A bit disappointed that they don't have hainan chicken rice but I got my long lost Singaporean laksa." u"Truly authentic Singapore food -- from my Singapore colleague. This is a very good Singapore Restaurant the cook is good and the flavor always remains the same level. Too shame we can't find it on google map and the door is not obvious. The boss is so chill about money." u'The first place I found close to Times Square that impressed me! Great find 3 course menu every one was great! Loved the food and the service will definitely return. Perfect amount of heat in all dishes we tried. Laksa perfectly balanced! Give it a try' u"It's happened on weekend when we decided to stay overnight after YANKEE Game! So I choose this Millenium hotel at 44 street just in the middle of Times Square.  What I figured it out was this Hotel have Singaporean Restaurant it's been long time haven't eat Singaporean Cuisine so we had early dinner before the game They have prefix menu for $25  Appetizer  main course and Dessert are you kidding me? Manhattan price $25 probably only for one dish  either appetizer or dinner This was so special we choose two different appetizers grilled Rib and Chicken satay  both are delicious Our main course are Laksa and Chicken curry  OMG how many years I haven't eat this authentic Singaporean ? And the dessert is Famous junior cheesecake ! We were keep talking about our dinner whole night The next day before we went Home  we decided to have another dinner in this place again!\nThey will have Grand Opening in September 2017 highly recommended for people who love Asian cuisines  love itttt!!!!" u'So glad we found this wonderful restaurant! Searched on Yelp for restaurants near our hotel on 45th and even tho it is directly across the street from our hotel it was the 64th one listed. A bit difficult to find because it is hidden inside the Millennium Hotel but so worth the hunt. Delicious food with personable and impeccable service. Upscale atmosphere yet not expensive at all. Their 3 course price fix meal for $25. is an absolute steal anywhere let alone in Times Square.  Would not hesitate to go back!' u"Great food at a reasonable price. Our waiter was very personable and knowledgeable. We tried a few dishes he recommended and they were wonderful! Next time we catch a show we'll be sure to return!" u'Good Asian fusion restaurant featuring Singaporean food that is new to theater district. If you are nearby for a show and have some time to kill definitely a good place to be for food and/or drink. Plus right next to 1984 show $19.84 for a 2-course meal is a witty price for its quality!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
150.SOBA AZUMA,[u"We came here for an 11PM meal which I definitely did not NEED to eat but who can resist solid Japanese food when they come to New York? \n\nMy sister and I both got the soba set with tororo (the yam) over rice. The bowls that the soba is served in are GIANT. I mean they have a giant circumference and I realized later that there are slats so that the soba can drain which meant that the depth wasn't too crazy but the portions are still giant. You get to order how much noodle you want and they're all for the same price but my sister definitely did not finish the large portion that she got. \n\nGreat ambiance and service. Would come back for sure!" u'We had lunch here while visiting Manhattan and had a very good experience.\n\nTheir lunch specials are well-priced and their soba is yummy! Their curry was also super tasty and I liked their almond tofu dessert A LOT.\n\nTheir bathroom was also really clean and comfortable.\n\nReally good place to take a break and eat!\n\nInteresting note: for soba - small medium and large are the same price. Medium was big enough for us.' u'The beer is cheap the appetizers are fresh the noodles are huge. What\'s not to like?\n\nIt\'s a novel way to eat noodles so there are instructions on the back of the menu teaching you all the steps involved in ordering more soba turning your sauce into soup etc.\n\nThe menu has pictures of everything you can order so you don\'t need to be 100% sober and read a long list of ingredients to point at something and say "this one".' u"The best place for soba no lie. They give you 100g 200g AND 300g of so FOR THE SAME PRICE. The portions are huge! \n\nOrdered the combo with fried vegetable tempura and when it came out I was surprised the soba bowl was bigger then my head. The vegetable tempura ( its side remember that ) was piled up so high I couldn't get to the rice ! \n\nThe soba noodles were incredible I ordered the cold one so it's more or a dipping soba but incredible. They give you wasabi and a sauce to mix it and scallions! The amount was great I made the mistake of ordering 300g thinking it was small since I eat quite a lot. But noooo I'm sure 100g was plenty for me! \n\nDefinetly try this place out it's one of the best portion= price spot!" u"Perfect lunch spot! Ordered the soba mackerel set and some appetizers. Generous portions and everything tasted great! They offer a variety of different sets with cold or hot soba/udon so if you're craving for a good Japanese noodle meal this is definitely the place to go." u'I have never had soba before and have been wanting to try it for the longest time. \n\nI finally made my way to get it and found this place with good reviews. I went with a cold soba at 300g with a pork katsu/egg bowl. \n\nThe portions here are interesting you can order 100/200/300g all at the same price. I think it has to do with soba noodles not being good after sitting for a while. The cool this is can start with 100 and add on if you still want more up to 300g total.\n\n\nI decided to be me and just get all the noodles at once. The taste is ok but not something I would want to get again. It just seemed like I was dipping noodles into a light soy sauce. \n\nThe pork katsu bowl was also just ok. The sauce they use makes the rice very flavorful but the pork was a bit dry.\n\nOverall it was nice to try but not really my thing.' u"The noodle and rice combos are such a steal and the udon was really good (I'm not a soba fan). Udon was so good in fact that I went again the following week but the second time was not as good and the noodles were slightly overcooked so 4 stars." u"Having just returned from a trip in Japan had in intense craving for soba noodles. I decided to come here because of the raving reviews and amazing look pictures on Yelp. However I am sad to say that I was disappointed with the taste of the noodles. \n\nDragon Roll- The roll was pretty standard there was nothing particularly outstanding about it. But the price for a roll is pretty hefty: $13 for 6 pieces.\n\nSauteed Duck Soba Noodle- I was truly disappointed with the duck soba noodle. The order came with only 4 pieces of overcooked and tough duck meat. The noodles were soggy and the broth was too salty. This was nothing like what I had in Japan not even close. Considering that I'm paying 3x the amount for a bowl of soba compared to the price in Japan I expect better quality.\n\nI really wanted to like this spot but I am sad to say that I will not be returning here." u"This is my first review. \nI love Azuma's lunch!! \nGood Soba noodles and rice bowls. \nKakiage (mix veggies and shrimp tempura) is amazing!!!" u'Some notable points: \n\n1) You can choose your Soba portions! 100g-300g and the prices stays the same. I got 200g and my friend finished my meal:) \n\n2) My friends who frequent this area told me this place has faster service than Donburiya (next door) and prices are more reasonable than Yakitori Totto (above). \n\n3) Super sweet and helpful servers. \n\nOverall great if you are hungry! It\'s personally not worth my $15+ for a Soba set unless you are desperately hungry and trying to find some Soba in the immediate area. I like my Soba "al dente" but the noodles here were pretty soggy. My friend got udon and said it was too soft as well. I do have to admit my Soba standards are very high considering my family heritage and love for Soba...so come here if you want a big meal for $15-25!' u'Noodle Portion is huge.\nYou got to choose noodle size. Small  medium and large. We chose large. We deserve it after a long run.\nGrill squid is tasty. Love it very juicy and tender.' u"Soba Azuma is a pretty underrated restaurant in the Hell's Kitchen area. The beer is cheaper and the food comes in plentiful servings. Their known for their soba but also offer other bases such as rice or udon. Combination sets are the best route for trying a lot of different things. For those that eat more than others you'll be pleased to know that 1 serving of soba noodles are charged the same price up to 3 servings." u'First time trying cold soba and absolutely loved it. For other newbies out there cold soba comes with a dipping sauce on the side. To eat take a chopstick full of soba noodles dip into the dipping sauce and slurp. Great bang for your buck. \n\nSpace - Loved the wooden interior.\n\nService - Host and wait staff were super nice. Would definitely recommend this place for a business lunch. \n\nCold Soba Noodle w/ Kakiage Bowl Set - For only $13.50 + tax you can get up to 300 grams of soba noodles with dipping sauce and a whole bowl of rice topped with kakiage (a shrimp and vegetable tempura ball drizzled with a sweet dipping sauce). Note you can customize your order for 100g 200g or 300g of soba noodles for the same price. If you initially order 100g of soba noodles and decide you want another 100g of soba noodles during your meal there may be a 10-15 minute wait as the soba noodles are made fresh. Plan accordingly.' u"3.5 stars. If you are in a hurry and don't have a reservation for mid-town and couldn't get into Izakaya Totto next door this is the Japanese place to go. \n\nGreat service. Fast. The dishes are reasonable even though a bit sweeter than some of the authentic restaurants in the city. \n\nLotus roots appetizer is excellent. Great flavor and texture.\n\nSkip the spinach appetizer - too sweet. \n\nWhen ordering soba order medium amount of noodle so you get the best proportion of noodle to soup. We had large (the same price) and the amount of noodles were overwhelming. \n\nI really like the curry soba noodle. The curry flavor is not that strong making it a great base for noodle. \n\nSashimi is as expected. \n\nCombination sets are good deals. And if you opt for ice cream I preferred the green tea to sesame. Not too sweet. Smooth." u'Interesting variety of sake and good noodles too. The sushi is fresh and tasty. The classic soba dishes are excellent. The right combination of flavors and perfectly made noodles. Did not try the cold sobs though. The curry soba and duck soba were delicious.' u'First time having Soba. Very good. Quick service. Great location in midtown. Definitely worth returning next trip to NYC' u'In the row of several Japanese restaurants on 55th St. Great lunch option if you need large portion. This was the first time I had soba less versatile flavors and sides to choose than ramen but still an impressive experience.' u'Came here for lunch and the menu seem exciting and price is good. Ordered lunch special combo with sashimi tempura and cold soba. All soba noodles are the same price up to 300 grams (which is 3 portions from other restaurant) I went for medium but honestly small would be enough when I come back next. I was so excited that I found this place and I went back the next day. The food is great but the service is not the best especially for lunch. Not only I felt rushed missing water and need to ask again and again. So I have to edit my review to give them a 4 instead of 5. Food:5 stars service:2 stars' u"A center of tranquility in the midst of the mid-town madness Soba Azuma is everything I love about Japanese restaurants. The decor is lovely and clean the staff is attentive and friendly but the real deal is the food. Oh the soba noodles . . . still swooning a week later. Nothing compares to homemade noodles except perhaps for the silky rich broth and simple good ingredients. Also highly recommend the seaweed salad. Surprisingly refreshing and just made me feel good while eating it like you know it's good for your body which just makes it taste all the better." u'This place is incredible! Way to get a bang for your buck. \nAny size of small medium large noodles is the same price. \nLovely friendly staff and most of all the food was delicious!'],0.5411,0.259,0.741,0.0
43.Go! Go! Curry!,[u"1st time having Japanese curry and I honestly didn't realize the Japanese had their own version of curry. \n\n1. It's nothing like Indian/South Asian or Southeast Asian (Thai Malay or Viet) curries.\n\n2. It has a similar look and taste to Mexican mole. However mole is sweeter and slightly bitter taste to it. Japanese curry has a distinct flavor to it not too sweet and not spicy at all. \n\n3. Fast casual setting that offers protein selections - pork chicken shrimp sausage etc. Combos are also available. \n\n4. Small shop with limited seating" u'Good no-frills Japanese curry that will satisfy your curry craving.  \n\nI had the basic curry topped with chicken katsu.  The curry was very flavorful and the katsu was nice and crispy.  \n\nService was quick and environment was clean.  One thing to note is there is no restroom at this location.\n\n A short walk from Port Authority.' u'No thrills good old comfort food that\'s quick to grab and go! \n\n- Food: Got the Pork Katsu Curry. Katsu breading was light and crispy perfectly fried while the pork inside moist and juicy. Curry was fragrant slightly saltier than would have liked. Rice perfectly cooked. Good portions - small was good enough for me large (+ a little of my portion) was filling enough for my fianc\xe9 (think 6\'3" with an appetite).\n- Place: Tiny shop with limited seating. No bathrooms. \n- Service: Quick and professional. \n- Price/Value: It was a little pricier than I expected but hey it\'s the city and well worth it considering the pricier options around that give you a lot less quality and quantity.' u"I'll give them 3.5 stars really.  It's okay I've had better Japanese curry before.  Their curry was a bit too salty for me. The Pork Katsu was fried pretty well but really way too much curry. Everything just became overly salty after a few bites.  I also didn't really care for the shredded lettuce thing on the side.  I came here at 8pm and there wasn't a line and plenty of seats.  \n\nDefinitely one star off for no bathrooms.  I hate that especially if I am eating here. \n\nThe price is pretty good.  $9 for a medium plate and I could see why people like coming here. The price point for this area is definite an attractive point.  I would probably come back if I need a cheap dinner but definitely would not make a special trek out." u"Visiting the City for work and I was tight on time in between meetings this place was a great option for take-out. If you're a fan of any katsu this spot adds curry on top with a generous side of rice and shredded cabbage. I think their menu servings has slightly changed but the menu offerings include chicken sausage shrimp and pork katsu then additional toppings such as boiled egg or cheese if you like or even more sauce so you can cater it to be your own. Just getting the original Go! Go! Curry the curry sauce is smothered on the katsu spilling into the rice and cabbage and it's so delicious!\n\nThe place is a bit small like anything in the City but it's an eat and run kind of place. There is a minimum of $10 to use a credit card. Friendly folks that work there as well!" u"EASY SPOT TO GRUB AND BOUNCE!\n\nLiterally a quick sit down chow down and leave kind of a place. (Also noticed how a lot of people would pick up their orders!) \n\nOf course I had to get their Grand Slam w/ Extra fried shrimps! - taste delicious! (Only thing I'll change next time will be to add more sauce!) I appreciate that this place does NOT over load on the rice. It was laid flat on my plate which compliment my cutlet VERY MUCH!\n\nFor $16... its a bargain! Will def be back!!!!!" u"Ever since my brother introduced me to this spot I made it a tradition to stop by at least once a year. Normally around Comic Con or Auto Show.\n\nThis place is pretty small and can get crowded especially during lunch rush or special events like Comic Con. I went on a Thursday afternoon with my friends as luckily the booth seat were available was available. \n\nStaffs are friendly and the service was quick. Food came out fairly fast. The price is decent but it's worth the price. \n\nHome Run Curry (5/5) - Comes with pork or chicken katsu shredded cabbage eggs one sausage and a shrimp tempura and their curry sauce on top of white rice. Love the curry sauce! Everything was just right." u"I've been meaning to try this place for some time. Finally got around to it.\n\nI walked in to a relatively empty store and ordered the double chicken katsu curry. Got my order in about 5 mins. The portion size is a pretty good size for someone with an appetite. I was pretty hungry that day so it worked. The double is considered a large.\n\nThe katsu was lightly fried perfectly cooked and very tasty. I think the chicken katsu was the highlight of the meal. The curry was a little gelatiney and salty. The rice hidden underneath and not really visible in many pics was a good sized portion. I wasn't sure from looking at the food pics online if there was gonna be enough rice.\n\nThe pricing isn't bad here about $9.50 for the large chicken katsu curry. Good place for a quick meal if your in a rush." u"This was my first meal on a girls' trip to NYC. Good price and great food! We had the pork and shrimp katsu and have no complaints! \n\nLove that there's free cabbage (and extra cabbage). Wish I had gotten an egg but I'm sure that would've been great too!\n\nThe meat and shrimp was juicy and well seasoned and the small size was a good size for a satisfying but not overwhelming meal. \n\nAaron who worked the register was also friendly and helpful." u"I work about a 6 minute walk to here so I stopped by for lunch around 12:30PM. I considered ordering for pickup online ahead because I was afraid they'd be slow but  ended up taking my chances. They had two cash registers going --one on the left for cash only right for cards. The cash line was considerably shorter and fast moving. With that said after ordering I waited only maybe 3 minutes before my food was ready.\n\nI got the small pork katsu curry and it was really a good (around 9$ aftertax) a perfect portion for lunch for someone with a smaller appetite. Also the curry to rice ratio was perfect for me and there was just enough spice for me to feel a bit tingly but not enough to make me uncomfortable as I am usually not into spicy food. \n\nOverall I'll be back if I ever get a curry craving for sure!" u'The most city budget friendly place ever.\nIf you are dying for some cheap pork chicken katsu topped with delicious curry served with rice come HERE.\nYou will not regret it!!!' u"Best japanese curry in the U.S. Hands down. Not joking. I have a such fond memories here that every time I come back to New York I make an effort to eat here because I love it that much. \n\nI was telling my fianc\xe9 that nothing beats Go! Go! Curry! not even the various places we've tried in California. I don't know what they do but they do it so good and so quick that its crazy they haven't taken over the world yet. \n\nThe place is small but don't let that disheartened you. True you may have to fight a bunch of people for a seat but trust me its worth it. It is very shareable; we usually share a special and to be honest I kick myself every time for not getting my own." u"If you're a veteran with Japanese or Korean style curries you'll find that this establishment is pretty mediocre. And for those who've never tried his type of curry this is a standard place to start your familiarity with. \n\nOne night I was surfing deep into YouTube and went on a Go! Go! Curry! binge (their Japan locations though). I was so enticed by the casual yet fun experience and the variety of protein you can eat the curry with. Not to mention their crazy challenges too! But the reason why I really wanted to try this place was you can get a spicy version of the curry not only that but there are different levels of spiciness too. Me being an avid lover of pain from spice and ruining my stomach I really wanted to get my hands on some of this.\n\nSadly the New York locations do not offer the spicy version of curry and even more sad that they don't have a spice powder to add on but instead an American brand of hot sauce that tasted similar to Tobasco. I added that onto my pork katsu curry and wow...the vinegar in the hot sauce just didn't go well with the curry at all. I was deeply disappointed in that. Without the spice it was a basic curry to me that didn't stand out from other restaurants in NYC or the ones I make at home. \n\nTheir pork katsu was good pretty standard. I also got a side of their dumplings. For $2.55 you get 3 fried dumplings which I thought was a bit of a rip off. Also the size small portion is good for a lunch meal or if you're barely getting hungry. My friend got the medium size which they gave the same amount of pork katsu for size small but added more rice.\n\nI probably would not return here but like I said previously if you're a newbie to Japanese style curry this would be a good place to start." u"This place is so good!! Less than $8 and super good. The curry is to die for - has a good kick to it and deep with spices. One of the best katsu curries i've had. \n\nIt is the best comfort food on a snowy or gloomy day in New York. \n\nI would recommend getting the medium rice + chicken katsu you would regret it. Check it out in NY very relaxed environment.\n\nP.S. you get free cabbage with every dish." u"Affordable place near Times Square to grab a quick bite. I ordered the pork katsu with a boiled egg and thought the pork was fried well and the curry was delicious. I'd be interested in coming back to try the chicken katsu and other offerings." u'The home run-very good. Pork katsu is very tender and juicy but also a little fatty. Shrimp tempura is so juicy that it almost melts in your mouth. Sausage is average. A little salty. White rice is of good quality. Very thinly shredded cabbage. Thick and dark curry sauce. Small portion.' u"Love Go! Go! Curry! This is a really great place to stop in for a quick bite - you order at the counter and you can get your order within 5 minutes. The portions are also huge and super filing. The pork katsu is fried and perfectly crispy and the curry flavorful with the littlest kick of spice and there's more than enough for all your rice. I also really love their smoked sausage. Definitely wish I lived closer to a Go! Go! Curry!" u"Pretty good and not too expensive either.\n\nI had the HomeRun with 1 slab of pork katsu 1 sausage 1 egg and 1 breaded fried shrimp (shrimp tempura) cabbage and rice beneath. The curry was flavorful and was just a bit spicy. The curry was so good i wished for more. Everything else had nice taste. \n\nThe pork katsu was up to standard. The sausage was crispy outside (but not burned at any part) and the inside was cooked to the right degree. The shrimp tempura was just perfect! Cruncy breading outside some taste of mayo in the middle and shrimp inside.\n\nOnly one thing they could improve was that the pork katsu breading was kinda falling a part and became soft and soggy after just a little bit. I guess it was because the pork katsu wasn't dipped into enough eggs before being fried and the katsu wasn't fresh of the frying pan.\n\nAnyway $10.34 for all the food. Great tasty deal!" u"I was so excited to try Go! Go! Curry! after watching youtuber Mikey Chen try it in Japan. There are multiple locations around Manhattan but the one here seems like the most go to location of them all. \n\nWhen I asked for the World Champion curry rice the lady cashier giggled at me like am I sure I want to get it. Of course we were going for the World Champion curry rice like Mike Chen did. It's the biggest dish they have on the menu. Rice with Curry sauce 2 Pork Katsu 2 Chicken Katsu 2 Shrimp Tempura 4 Sausages 2 Boiled Eggs and Cabbage. \n\nThe World Champion dish is substantial and huge. Food coma waiting to happen. The rice with curry sauce was fantastic. Nice slight peppery flavor and the curry sauce is thick. The Shrimp Pork and Chicken are all equally fried to perfection. They were crunchy moist tender and not to mention awesome. The sausage added a good smokey flavor to the dish and change in taste. \n\nWe also got a side of pickled shallots because I think it helps cleanse your pallet from the heaviness of the curry. It definitely helped and aided me in eating this dish. \n\nEven though I had a food coma. I felt good. I finished. I feel like a World Champion." u'Go Go curry is a good place to start if you\'ve never had any Japanese curry before. The price is inexpensive and it\'s really filling. Additional toppings are $1.50 or $2 which is pretty cheap for a curry place in Manhattan. There\'s no spice level but the curry isn\'t very spicy. I can\'t tolerate the smallest spice but it\'s a bit spicier than a "mild" type of spice. They also have a water jug with cups! I would highly recommend getting the katsu (pork) over the chicken. They use white meat for their chicken cutlets. The shrimp is also a good topping. There\'s no head so it\'s easy to eat. They also put some mayo on the shrimp. \nI\'ve had curry with the pork katsu and shrimp as toppings many times but the mayo had a weird and a bit of a sour taste this one time :/. \n\nMy go-to menu item is the Grand Slam with 2 pork katsus shrimp 2 sausages egg if I\'m with a friend. The portion is really big and sharable. The total comes out to a bit more than $13; less than $7 a person! \nI also frequently buy the Home Run if I am eating alone. It has the same toppings as the Grand Slam but only consists of one pork/chicken katsu shrimp 1 sasuage egg. It\'s a bit big for one person but not exactly sharable depending on how much the two people could eat. \n\nThey have new lunch items that consist of gyudon and terriyaki on the weekdays that\'s on display next to the cashier. I plan on trying those next but I\'m not sure if it comes with rice.\n\nIt\'s a grab and go type of place but there\'s space if you want to stay in and eat. There\'s about 15-17 seats bar seating and tables. \n\nThe staff there are really friendly and patient. When I first went here there was a very enthusiastic worker who made the store seem really friendly. I\'m not sure if she still works there anymore since I rarely see her there. \n\nThis location is convenient as it is a short 10 minute walk from the Times Square 42nd Street train station. \nWould visit again if I\'m in the area for go go day! They give a coupon for a free topping if you purchase on every 5th 15th and 25th. They also have a curry "roux"-lette!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
177.Laboratorio,[u'Great cozy Italian restaurant! They share the same owners and menu as the other more popular Italian restaurants down the street.' u"$15 homemade pasta??? Say no more! This Hells Kitchen establishment is like Cardi B's engagement ring - solid gem. \n\nLaboratories is perfect for any occasion - whether it's a family dinner catch up kiki with the girls or romantic date. The wines are super affordable and the servers even make great recommendations on which wine would pair well with your meal." u"Laboratorio is owned by the same fine folks who own Aria and Briciola all on the same block  (51st between 8th and 9th).  They also own a bunch of places in the west village. We were in line for Aria without a reso (which gets crazy busy on Saturday) and were asked if we wanted to try their new sister restaurant.  It has the same menu so we decided to try it.\n\nIt turned out to be a great decision. I had the linguini vongole w/ clams in white wine sauce. It was excellent especially for the price point. The pasta was al dente and the sauce had good flavor without being too buttery. I tried my wife's rigatoni was that was very good as well.  The wine selection was reasonably priced. My wife and I opted for the half carafe and it worked out well as neither of us were drinking a lot that night.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dishes at that price point.  The service was excellent throughout.  We will definitely be back to try more of their stuff." u'Very good Italian on the west side \n\nModerate prices \n\nGreat service \n\n1 dollar happy hour oysters and wild boar pasta are highly recommended!' u"A friend and I went to Laboratorio kind of by accident but we were pleasantly surprised with the meal here.\n\nThere was basically no one here on a Saturday early evening. But apparently this is a satellite restaurant of two very popular restaurants closer to 9th Avenue on the same block -- same food and everything.\n\nThey had a special for $1 oysters and how can you beat that. They were good oysters. The burrata cheese was delicious and came with a very generous portion of prosciutto. I had a very nice pasta with Italian sausage\n\nThe prices are pretty low with all the pasta being $14. They had a very odd system where they hand-wrote summaries of what the specials of the day were but it would've been better to just print out a small insert for the menu. They couldn't really tell you what the specials were anyway.\n\nOverall this location was much more relaxed than the copycat restaurants (owned by the same person) down the street which were packed when we walked by after dinner." u"Not your usual Italian food. \n\nBeet salad was excellent.\n\nWe both went for small plates. Hubby ordered sardines which were okay. I enjoyed lamb chops.\n\nPlenty of food without it being too much.\n\nI'd return just for the beet salad.\n\nOur tab was $45 with tip" u'The place is nice the food was excellent with nice and strong flavors. I would definitely return here when I\'m back at NYC. That said the "specials of the day" were way overpriced in my opinion I ordered a mushroom risotto that was definitely good and very tasty but not worth the price (more than double the pasta entrees prices) so think twice and ask for the price before ordering anything not in the regular menu.' u"Small cozy spot perfect for a date.  I like the format of the menu where all the apps are $12 the entrees are $14 etc.  Too bad this place doesn't show up on Yelp searches because this is one of the nicer simpler and low key Italian places I've been.  Charming spot and would definitely come back again." u"Stopped here for HH and $1 Oysters with a few coworkers a few days ago. This is a very odd place for NYC. Arrived twenty minutes before happy hour ended which we were fine with so we were seated at a table... except 10 minutes of that time was spent sitting without being served and the place was empty. During this time my coworker had to get the drink menu himself at the bar and then had to order our drinks and oysters at the bar (all the workers seemed to be pre-occupied with their phones). They took away our utensils and napkins after finding out we're not ordering anything else. The spritzers were mediocre at best.. After the oysters came my coworker had to get our own utensils at the bar and then we were served water. The oysters weren't very cold and wasn't very good. Such an interesting place for NYC perhaps a lunch or dinner experience would be different or maybe it was just a bad day.. but we wouldn't try it again.." u"Delicious plates and good prices for the area. Great for sharing - we had pasta lamb salad and the octopus all were great! It's also really spacious which is refreshing not to be sitting so close to other diners when restaurants try to cram in too many tables. Will go back!" u'It\'s fine.  its exactly the same as all the other italian places owned by these same people on the same street (there are two others).  I went thinking it would be Braai i guess they just changed it a couple of weeks ago.  They still have the chocolate lava cake they served at Braai now called a "chocolate souffle".  The mulva pudding is gone.  Still a cute space.  Much busier now already than Braai ever was probably why they changed it. But i\'ll miss it a lot I had so many good dates at Braai and loved the south african sidecar and the desserts. They changed out all the nice servers from Braai too.' u'We were a large group of 15 that dined here last night and did the pre-fix menu. What a wonderful evening! The space is lovely and the food and service were wonderful! Thank You to the entire staff for making our evening so wonderful and memorable! Will definitely be back!'],0.4574,0.499,0.501,0.0
116.Joe Allen,[u'Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat after seeing a play nearby.\n\nAfter perusing the menu I decided to go with the chicken salad that came with an assortment of mixed veggies. The salad was actually very good and had some nice flavor to it--it was a bit overpriced but still good.\n\nI also had a little bit of guacamole as an appetizer and that was good as well.\n\nOverall this place is a little bit fancier than most and the prices reflect that but they serve up some simple fare at reasonable prices for the area. Service was excellent and food came out quickly.' u"Went there for dinner to celebrate a friend's first time directing on Broadway. So we started with dessert. A warm brownie with hot fudge and ice cream.  With all of our excitement to start by eating something sweet first unfortunately it was not hot at all. The waiter came over and gave some excuse of some kind - like the ice cream makes the fudge get cold or whatever. And after repeated promptings to bring us something warm he settled on bringing us some hot fudge to drizzle on. Fine. \n\nThe main course was basic. Hamburgers for each of us. Overcooked uninspired and meh. You have to make a good burger in NY. If you can't then don't sell them. Everything from Burger Joint in the Parker Meridien to Shake Shake and even Jackson Hole make delicious burgers. These burgers were far from delicious. \n\nComplained to waiter who did NOTHING. When the bill came and nothing was taken off the bill - not the cold dessert we started with or the burgers left half-eaten I asked for the manager. \n\nWill the Manager took off some of the charges and we left. I appreciated that. But it should not have gotten to this point. When I returned the burgers he should have been alerted and he clearly wasn't.\n\nI'm surprised at how many 3 4 and 5 stars they have on Yelp. I wanted to like it- I really did. It's a pretty restaurant my friend was excited to be on Broadway and to be eating at a Theater institution.  But really what it left me with is a feeling Joe Allen is now simply resting on its history it's reputation. \n\nThe food and the service are just not good anymore... and that's sad. So when choosing a restaurant to spend $75 per person on (that's what the burgers one side a few drinks cost) you should get something better than bad overcooked and cold food - Having a famous name and long history is just not enough. \n\nThey are on Restaurant Row. Go in for a drink before or after your show if you'd like. But there are plenty of better options if you are looking for good food in the area." u"Came in with high expectations which were not met. If it wasn't for the food I would be giving this place one star. The service was awful. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter to the bartender had an attitude. We asked to get seated in the main dining room and the hostess would not accommodate us because she said she had a lot of people that had requested it. The dining room was almost empty. When she came by again we asked if she could put on the Yankee play off game that had gotten changed. The bartender behind her chimed in I'm too busy right now even though we weren't talking to him.\n\nFood- the free range chicken salad was pretty good. The Apple cider vinaigrette was delicious. The mussels tasted like they hadn't been rinsed and tasted like the sea. The brisket sandwich ordered at our table looked like a better option.\n\nOverall a poor experience. I would not got back." u"I've long since known about Joe Allen's but never went there.  Supposedly the best time to go is when the plays end for the night because the actors like to hang out there.  Thus many have labeled it to be a tourist trap.  In the past I mentioned Joe Allen's to my husband but he wasn't interested in trying it.  That changed this last trip to NYC.  Normally I plan our visits to NYC well in advance and have a list of places to try.  This time we had to make our travel plans on very short notice as we had a death in the extended family.  \n\nWe were looking for a place to eat that wasn't too far from our hotel as it was drizzling outside.  My husband looked up places to eat and found...Joe Allen's!  Now he was interested in going and asked me again what I knew about it.  So...off we went.\n\nWe were here for an early dinner around 5 p.m. on a night when the theaters are dark.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted and seated at a two top.  Joe Allen's isn't as cramped as many Manhattan restaurants.  That said I wished that our table was a little larger.\n\nOur server was very friendly plus prompt and efficient.  She took our drink orders.  I had water while my husband had a beer.  She told us that menus are printed up every day so what you see on the menu will definitely be available.  I liked that because many times restaurants run out of an item and say nothing until you try to order it.\n\nI ordered New England lobster and crab roll.  It came on a New England style hot dog roll that was toasted (if a bit on the burned side) and dressed with mayo.  For a bit of crunch there was some celery and some raw onions.  The onions were noticeable but not overpowering.  This roll was good--- more crab than lobster not the best I've ever had but decent nonetheless.  It came with house made chips which were surprisingly good.  Most house made chips that I've had in the past seemed to be overcooked and flavorless.  These ones were properly cooked with enough crunch and salt---not dried out at all.  Also there was a dill pickle slice.\n\nMy husband had their meatloaf which is considered a signature dish of theirs.  He really liked it.  I tasted a piece and agreed that it was moist and well flavored with the gravy accompanying it very well.  it also came with mashed potatoes which tasted homemade (probably were) plus some sauteed spinach which was lightly seasoned.  He liked it so much that he now wants to go back to Joe Allen's for more!\n\nWe still had room for dessert.  When I heard that they had coffee ice cream I decided to order some as I hadn't had any literally in years.  It was an overly generous portion which consisted of 2 scoops.  I enjoyed it!\n\nMy husband ordered fresh fruit which consisted of pineapple strawberries red grapes and honeydew melon.  We were both surprised at how much was on the plate!  He doubted that he could finished it all----but somehow he managed!  All the fruit was at its freshest.\n\nBefore the tip dinner was about $75.  We're both glad that we finally got here and would go again next time we're in town!" u'This little Broadway hangout was pretty nice. I had their meatloaf with mashed potatoes and it was very good (I usually do not care for meatloaf however it was recommended by a family member). It was moderately priced and was fair because the quality of the food was very good. Another thing I noted was that their coffee was really good. I do not usually care for restaurant coffee but this place had unusally good coffee.' u'After my 40 years in Manhattan still my favorite restaurant in NYC -- my number #1 go to place -- and everyone there both staff and patrons are at least that much younger than me. Ha! Great place.' u"This has become my favorite preshow dinner spot. Each time my boyfriend and I go to a show we end up here for dinner and we love this tradition. It's off the beaten path and never too crowded as we hate the typical Times Square tourists.\n\nLately we have gotten the steak twice the chicken and the homemade pasta dish. All of the dishes have been absolutely delicious and they are the perfect portions especially because you don't want to bring leftovers to the theater. \n\nThe service is always great and we never have issues getting a table even without a reservation. Absolutely love this place and we will be back the next time we have tickets to a show!" u'Joe Allen is a classic bar and grill.  It is a great location for the theater.    The food is is solid bar food nothing exceptional but good.  The guacamole was fresh hamburger was decent and French fries good.  It is nice restaurant that serves a need before the theater.' u'We ended up at this place after finding the wait at Dim Sun palace down the street to be too long. We were happy that we did. The place is dark but welcoming with posters fro Broadway shows along the walls. \n\nIt was a Sunday so we had brunch. The eggs Benedict were creamy and very tasty. The asparagus and cheese omelette was very juicy and the Scala salad was just tremendous. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast.' u"The food was good but the service was ok. The food was rushed. We weren't done with the appetizer and they brought the dinner. I really hate that because we could not enjoy the food. The  restaurant wasn't busy so I didn't understand why we were rushed. Then the waiter went on a break and then we were left to fend for ourselves. I expected better from this restaurant." u"Joe Allen's is one of my favorite pre- / post-theater spots in the city. It reeks of old school Broadway in the best possible way. Walk down the stairs under the famous green awning and it's 1965 all over again. The walls are lined with photos of celebrities and posters of Broadway flops (no hit allowed!). You can get a steak or some scallops an Eye-talian speciality. Maybe something vegetarian but I doubt it. Definitely a dirty martini or a rye Manhattan. All kidding aside the food is very good and the service excellent. It's just far enough off the beaten track that despite its legendary status it's not overwhelmed with tourists. Definitely worth a try." u'My sister was in town visiting me and I was on a work trip. We had looked up online the 10 best restaurants in Hells kitchen - theater district in Manhattan. The article we found was hilarious. It said something like "this restaurant if you were in high school-would be the prom queen." We tried to get into bar Central located right next-door and since we did not have a reservation they were completely at capacity. We stopped by Joe Allen. It was full of men. We were able to get seated right away but the host said we would only have an hour because they\'re expecting a party to sit in that table in an hour. We did what we had to do ordered a round of martinis ordered an appetizer and split a meal. We had vodka martinis (shocker) The tuna salad and the salmon. Our server seemed to be very impressed by the tuna salad so he sold us. However we were both unimpressed. The salmon however was delicious. It was perfectly cooked and came with a light veggie/salad on the side. It was very light and we left there not feeling completely full. It also didn\'t tamper with our vodka buzz.   . We unfortunately had to split between three cards because of my work. Our server was totally cool about everything. We never felt rushed or pressured because of the hour. Our time at Joe Allen had come to an end.' u'Great atmosphere nice food simple but complete menu. Enjoyed the dinner good service would highly recommend. Nice small Neighborhood Restaurant had an excellent experience thank you very much.' u"My wife and I always make this our after-theater dinner spot. We've been multiple times and can't say enough good things about the food the service and the atmosphere. You also might see a Broadway star or two relaxing with a drink after a show.\n\nOur favorites include the meatloaf with mashed potatoes the fish and chips and the banana cream pie. The french dip is great also." u"Decent pre-theatre spot but the pickings are slim. The soups are good burgers are average. It's extremely cramped inside so not the most pleasant atmosphere but they'll get you through quickly and in time for your show." u"This quickly became  my favorite little neighborhood restaurant in NYC. There are fancier places but not as warm and comfortable. I almost wish I could find a reason to give them a bad review because I don't want it to get any more crowded lol. \n\nThe liver plate is simply the best I have ever had. I needed up addicted and eating there almost every night I was in town and I lost weight because the food has quality ingredients and it is so satisfying. \n\nThe bar tender worked hard to find a wine I could drink with my sulfate allergy. I settled on their house Pinot and I felt perfect. \n\nI can't wait to go back for liver next week." u"The food is not fancy but it tastes good. The location is perfect for the theatre. Contrary to some other reviews I found the restaurant staff warm and welcoming even though we were half an hour late for our reservation and the restaurant was busy. The waiter was friendly personable and helpful. Prices are standard for the area. This was a perfectly nice experience. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's not amazing or spectacular or mind blowing; it's decent and competent and comfortable and pleasant. And that's a good thing." u"Old tired  dated spot. Came here to meet family for brunch. Awful. My egg white omelette was humble as were the other dishes ordered. I realize this is considered a New York classic but I think it's waaaay past it's prime. Don't bother." u"This was a revisit after two years and last time I tried their dinner so decided to give a try on their brunch.\n\nApparently they were just opening up when my friend and I got there however they still welcomed us warmly! A selection of brunch items were offered and we chose salmon with scrambled egg (with muffin) and Cajun chicken sandwich. The fries accompanied the chicken sandwich was so crispy! Only thing was that they do not offer skim milk here so I settled myself with whole milk.\n\nI'd love to come back given the amid ambience and delicious food. There are just so many good restaurant around this neighborhood and I felt so lucky!" u'Had an evening meal at Joe Allen.  Very good service especially from the manager who was passing by when we had a small accident.  Liked the food although the steak seemed "heavy" in my stomach afterwards.  Fun ambiance--it was a Monday night & there were two tables of theater folk nearby.'],0.5106,0.216,0.784,0.0
156.Havana NY,[u'I have been seeing people check in here on FB & seen that the ratings here & on Google. When another local Cuban restaurant had to put me on a "will call when seat is ready list" I decided to come here. It\'s located near Herald Square where I frequent to shop. It is a much-larger space than the other Cuban restaurant that I was going to patronize-two floors. I also like that this isn\'t a fusion restaurant-Cuban dishes only.\n\n     The ropa vieja was all that I could ask for & also served in a plantain shell. It was prepared well & in a timely manner. Seafood & chicken meals are also available as are alcoholic beverages.\n\n      The waiter as well as manager was quite attentive despite it being an average busy Friday night. While the atmosphere isn\'t noisy (no band) TVs are available at the bar.\n\n     I shall return & I recommend Havana NYC to others.' u"We came around 9:00 pm for dinner and the place was packed and VERY noisy. The restaurant itself was lovely and normally I don't mind ambient noise but this was too much and I wish that I had some kind of hearing protection.\n\nWith that said our server was excellent and the meal quite delicious. We started off splitting the Pastel Cangrejo as an appetizer. I could just about live on crabcakes and this dish did not disappoint. I ordered the Pollo Anjillo off the menu as my main and my husband ordered the Billogorio Cardo special. Mine was flavorful but the chicken was a little on the dry side. My husband raved about his entree. \n\nOther than the initial noisiness it was a very pleasant dinner." u"PROS: Staff were very friendly and efficient.  Food and drinks came out quickly and we were checked on just the right amount of times to where we felt like we were being tended to without feeling like they were hovering.  The space itself is very nice and though small I didn't feel like I was dining with the group next to us which was great.  \n\nCONS: Many on here are referring to this as authentic Cuban food and I'm sorry but it's not.  While nothing tasted bad nothing had the usual pop I've come to expect from Cuban cuisine.  The vaca frita for instance tasted like pepper steak. The usual flavors of garlic acid and salt were just missing.  The croquettes lacked ham flavor which is kinda important for that dish. My boyfriend and his mother (both cuban and his mom grew up there) were both really disappointed.  \n\nThis restaurant would likely please a wide range of palates but if you're seeking truly authentic Cuban food skip this one." u"My team decided to hit this place up for a team lunch after looking through yelp. When we arrived we were blown away by the decor. We really didn't know that we would find a place like this nearby. \n\nI ordered the salmon which came over a bed of veggies side of yellow rice and black beans. The salmon was good but definitely not the best salmon they could have had. The rice had an okay seasoning. Black beans were good. \n\nI'd definitely visit again and give their other fishes a try. \n\nMy manager ordered a paella that looked amazing but I get a chance to try it. I'm definitely ordering it next time. It's not on the menu so talk to your server." u"Really good Cuban food. I went here with some coworkers for lunch. We made a reservation for 12 but didn't need one since we were the only ones in there at the time. There was Spanish music on which was nice to listen to while enjoying the meal. The interior was very clean and also decorated very nicely. We were waited on by a very friendly and knowledgeable server who provided great recommendations on the dishes.\n\nEach of my coworkers got something different and we tried each of them. We did not have to wait long for our food. Please note there is paella on the menu even though it is not listed; and I HIGHLY recommend getting that. The seafood tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. The chicken and rice was also very good and a large portion.\n\nGood place to go to if you want a nice sit down lunch that won't take the entire afternoon." u"Came here for dinner with friends and everyone enjoyed themselves. We all ordered something a little different and all had good things to say. I had the Ropa Vieja and it was excellent. And BIG! I took it home and had it for lunch the next day. Try the appetizer sampler to get a feel for everything. At the time they were not offering alcohol but I think they may have gotten a liquor license at his time. If that's important to you give them a call before coming." u"Wow i really hope the food in Cuba is as good as the food in Havana NY.\n\nThis place is way better than Calle Dao first off and is only two or so streets down. Service is over the top in the best way possible and our waiter starlin was so knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We essentially got all of his recommendations. \n\nFrom the pork entree where the meat slides right off the bone the skirt steak with a pesto sauce and the amazing paella that he serves in front of you. \n\nThe garlic bread even is amazing. Crispy on the outside soft white dough on the inside. \n\nThere is also a happy hour! I forget which times though :( \n\nSeating is limited mainly 4 tops and it got crowded fairly quickly. \n\nThe beef empanadas are sooo good perfectly crunchy and plenty of meat. There's also a Delicious fresh seafood cocktail that comes with diced up mango plantain chips and has the citrus juice kick to it. We also got a beef appetizer that's circled around a cooked plantain which was delicious. \n\nI would definitely come back!! One of the best meals I've had in the city definitely. Food is standardly priced entrees around low 20s. Again check out their happy hour" u"2 friends and I came here for dinner. When we entered the staffs were super friendly! We decided to share the Papas Rellenas de Carne(potato puffs filled with beef) for appetizer and the seafood paella. Both dishes tasted wonderful. The potato puffs were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The seafood paella had lots of flavors and spice.\n\nOne interesting thing was when our waiter was leaving his shift he stopped by our table and asked if everything was good and said he'll be going now so another waiter will be taking care of us. I was surprised to this because no waiter ever did this action to me or our friends before. We thought usually when staff is leaving their shift they would just leave the restaurant. But nope this waiter didn't do that. He was super friendly and helpful and well mannered!" u"An expensive average experience. The atmosphere and ambiance were nice and our server was delightful. The skirt steak I ordered was OK as were my fianc\xe9's assortment of side dishes. Overall I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. $100 dollars (including tip) for two drinks one entree and three side dishes." u'Delicious Cuban food! The pork chop was amazing. And so was the seasoned shredded roast beef. The food was incredibly affordable.' u"Came here on a Friday evening at 5pm and was very pleased with the food. We shared the app sampler.  The fried yucca was great and the light-pink Chipotle mayo was a perfect complement. My entree was mango shrimp with coconut rice. The mango sauce that topped the shrimp was sweet and tangy but the shrimp was a bit overcooked. The rice was fantastic. \n\nHowever the service was offputting.  We arrived way before the dinner rush and there was only two tables seated in the whole restaurant but the host checked his computer and discussed with his coworker whether to seat us for a good three minutes because we didn't have a reservation.  Finally after we were seated I thought things would get better but after being given the menus our waiter disappeared. Water took a good 5 minutes to arrive and after what seemed like 15 minutes we finally had to ask for someone to take our order.  Things got better after that. The restaurant finally started getting busy at around 6:30 7:00 so I was not sure why seating us at 5:00 was that much of an issue. \n\nAnother thing that would have made the experience a little better was if they had a cocktail drink list.  We were given a listing of the wines but the waiter told us the different specialty cocktails (of which there were many) and it was hard to pick one without seeing it written out." u"Awful. Started with the avocado salad. They charged $16 for some bagged lettuce an onion slice two tomato slices and half an avocado. And the dressing? They brought oil and balsamic to the table. Main dishes were completely lacking any flavor. The pork shank special was tasteless and the rice was as dry as sawdust. The chicken in garlic sauce was five small piece on the bone no hint of garlic anywhere. And they charge extra if you want the chicken off the bone. Cocktails were decent but small.\n\nHard to believe the positive reviews of this place. Worst meal I've had in a long long time. Makes me lose faith in Yelp." u'This restaurant is high class !! The service was amazing and I am so impressed... will be coming back for happy hour after work. Must get mojitos & lobster tail. Sit at upper level bar Steven is the best! \n\n8/31/2017: Came back to Havana NY! Still equally as fantastic service (the pork shoulder was gone in seconds) walking distance to Refinery Hotel & Archer. Fantastic place to stop for pre rooftop dinner/drinks!' u'My group and I walked in close to 7 PM on Monday and we were allowed to seat ourselves without a reservation. The first thing that stood out to me was the cleanliness of the establishment and the great decor. \n\nA waiter came up to us right away to take drinks order as well as tell us the specials. Service was good. The staff were attentive and gave us adequate amounts of time to pick our food as well as enjoy our meal. \n\nWe ordered a pitcher of white sangria and fried plantains for the table. Both were delicious and a perfect way to kick off the meal. For my main course I ordered rabo encendido cubano which entailed of oxtails cooked in a red wine sauce with a side of rice and beans and some raw carrots and corn on the side. The rice and beans were delicious and the oxtails were very tender however the sauce was a tad on the saltier side. The raw carrots seemed more like an afterthought that were placed randomly on the plate personally I think a small side of steamed veggies would have worked better. However the corn was marinated very well.\n\nAll in all the ambience of the restaurant was wonderful and food was good. The hours felt like they just flew by when we were there!' u"Our first visit to the lovely restaurant. We came with our friends who come here often. \nWe were seated upstairs and was greeted by one of the owners Abbas I think with rum shots because he knew the friends we were with. What a way to start the evening. \nWe started with apps before moving on to dinner. This was our first visit to a Cuban restaurant or friends did the ordering! I'm not even sure what we had but it was fall off the bone tender. Everything was wonderfully tasty and fresh. \nWe finished with flan a wonderful finish to a great evening. Go... You'll love it!!" u'I had heard good things about this place and since I was watching a movie in the area we decided to come here for happy hour and early dinner. \nThe minute we walked in we were warmly greeted and sat at a table near the bar. \nWe ordered some happy hour drinks while we checked out the menu. \nI had the margarita which was pretty good. For my entree I had that days special which was a pork shank that came with rice and beans mix together. \nThe food was great and good portions. My friends had the ropa vieja and really enjoyed their meal as well. \nOur server was very friendly and funny and made sure we were taken care  \nThe place was packed for a Wednesday evening.' u"Havana NY is a Cuban restaurant in Midtown I went here with my coworkers and I don't think we will go back. Service was great plenty of seating energetic staff.... the food was just subpar and kinda pricey. The chicken was very dry needed some sort of sauce or something. None of my coworkers were wowed" u'Excellent and attentive wait staff. Food was delicious and authentic. Very creative menu with lots specials. Overall this is a great place.\nWe had a great time.' u'We went here for a work event and they were able to accommodate us upstairs.\nAmbiance: upstairs was very roomy and not noisy. Great for families.\nFood: flavorful everything was well seasoned\nService: our server was very funny and attentive. He checked on us soo many times and actually got the meals correct for the amount that we had in our group.\nOverall it was a good experience and the group enjoyed it very much.' u"Came here tonight for my friend Andrea G's pre-birthday dinner celebration. She made an early reservation through OpenTable weeks ago. Very spacious restaurant with a full bar near the front entrance. I didn't get a chance to explore the second flood. Too bad the half booth was a bit tight and I don't like when people are eavesdropping so I suggested the table that's meant for a party of 4 along with the beautiful illustrations on the wall. Our server Oliver was very attentive and making sure everything was good and how we enjoyed our food. \n\nDrink: \nAndrea - White Sangria \n\nEntree:\nAndrea - Camarones Caribenos \n\nme: Ropa Vieja with my choice of yellow rice and red beans...I love how the shredded beef was plated inside a bowl made of deep fried thin plantains\n\nDamn Oliver was right about the chef's portion size will stuffed me like a turkey. I was completely full and absolutely had no room for dessert...::sad face:: how I love Flan (next time). \n\nDefinitely will come back because the food was superbly delicious!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
153.Woorijip Authentic Korean Food,[u"I was introduced to Woorijip by my Korean brethren(s) in 2005 (before I even heard of Yelp) as a late night spot to just grab some casual food. I like it then for that aspect a simple casual dining place. Has it changed much? Nope. Woorijip has managed to stay almost exactly the same and that is great. I never came here much for the hot buffet because it just seemed not so enticing to my palettes. But I enjoy all their packaged foods like gimbaps noodles vegetables and deserts.\n\nThis was the place I ate my first blood sausage. Ah the nostalgia.\n\nIt seems the hot buffet has remained the same/changed very lightly. I also see that the packaged foods as expanded lightly. I didn't notice the complimentary water on my recent visit or did I miss it. I saw the microwave.\n\nI even think there are more people dining there. It was a full house on my visit.\n\nSo simple. So good." u"My regular trips to K-town invite a new dining experience based on my mood.\n\nIn this case - healthy sit down but casual enough to permit my grungy outfit. \n\nThis place came up with a high star rating on Yelp and was on the same block.\n\nI was relieved to find that it was -\n1. An almost industrial cafeteria style\n2. Mostly Asian patrons \n3. A hot buffet for $8 a pound\n4. Prepackaged meals to go from soups to \n    Meal combos to rice bowls to desserts.\n\nI hit the buffet for some hot food.  I scored a half baked mackerel some Ferris wheel shaped lotus roots glorious Kim chi sauted eggplant Kim chi fried rice !! and more.\nThe food was fresh and tasty and cost me around $9 with a seltzer. \n\nAfter eating I had to survey the wonderful foods - jealous of what I missed out on.\nI grabbed a rice cake for dessert $1.50 and a Kim chi soup with pork to go $3.  \n\nWalking down the street I had to stop and try the soup.  It was that perfect rainy day love with some good pieces of pork and Kim chi. \n\nI love Koreatown.  As a matter of fact I havnt had one bad experience there.   I think I might have to try all the restaurants.\n\nSummary \nThis packed cafeteria style eatery has fresh healthy Korean food at a good price.  At 2pm I had to wait for a seat after I got my food.  It's popular for a reason. \n\nBudget outlet and clean." u"I like how casual this place is but if you're here for outstanding food probably not your place to be. It's definitely a great value and a great place for a group. My friend got a takeout box with kimbap kimchi bulgogi fried rice and dukbokki. I think all the food was mediocre if not lacking. Maybe we just didn't choose the good items or it was sitting out for a while since it was kind of late but it won't defer us from coming here again.\n\nMy friends and I were mainly here to drink a little before going to a show. You buy your alcoholic beverages of choice and the cashier will give you the same number of cups as IDs. It was a good time and we could sit for as long as we want. Would come back just didn't think the food was special." u"Located in koreatown (it's on the same block as the other Korean shops and restaurants). They have a huge selection of prepared box meals and a buffet bar. I went a little before 5pm so they were just preparing their buffet. I peeked at their options though and they left me near drooling. As for their boxed foods there were various kimbap rolls bento boxes and hot foods like katsu curry. \n\nI got the katsu and curry rice - all hot dishes and very YUMMY! Reasonably priced too. My friend got a bento box that included the purple-ish red sticky rice which I don't see often in Korean restaurants. I tried a bite and it was really good! Brought back childhood memories for some strange reason. I would come here all the time if I lived around the area. \n\nHighly recommend this spot especially if you're in a rush and just want to grab something quick without having to sacrifice the food quality." u'I can\'t believe I never wrote a review for Woorijip... aka the "drunken" hangout after say 2AM... \n\nNo fuss no thrills... not fancy just Korean quick eats... and me & my friends used to looooove eating here: cheap good food and soju.... but that all changed pretty quickly.  Don\'t get me wrong Woorijip was a consistent hangout place... for the last 15 years.  After Reno new layout came with new price$$! \n\nMy favs included kimbaps cold sprout salad beef bulgogi jeons japchae and seasonal fishes.  Their package lunch boxes were also decent.  \n\nNow in 2017... a little wiser... should know better.  Couldn\'t help myself - went in for a quick bite.  Their food turned to sh*t quality prices went 20% higher and I don\'t see how anyone would pay $12-13 for a crappy lunch box!?!  There\'s just better food than here... the dang food court has a better food game!  #goodbye20s #done' u"Congratulations Woorijip - you are voted as the worst restaurant I've visited in NYC. I came here around 10pm on a weekend. By then food was mostly gone. But that was understandable since I came really late at night. \n\nThe quality of the food is so bad. Beef bulgogi was hard to chew and it tasted bland. Kimchi tasted too salty. As for the kimchi pancakes they were plain awful. They didn't taste like kimchi at all and they were way too oily. I thought I was chewing on to a soggy cardboard box.  Fried rice was okay.\n\nI heard people usually come here to get cheap soju before clubbing. I don't recommend you to get food here but definitely do come if you are looking for cheap drinks. I went on a weekend night so the majority of people were drinking instead of eating. \n\nFood is terrible. But I gave two stars instead of one star for the cheap soju." u"It's not the best but it's not the worst. I love stopping by for lunch because I can grab a lunch box + salad for under $9.\n\nThe line gets really long during lunch and it looks intimidating but it really moves by quick! \n\nBe sure to get their rewards card. I've racked up about eight cards so far and tonight I got another one! Haha \n\nI stop by after work for dinner and some drinks often. This spot is the go-to for pregaming FYI.\n\nMy favorite dish is the garlic chicken which comes out to be $7.00 pre-tax." u"1st time here & didn't know it was a buffet till I saw the food. Most of the meat is sweet (chicken & beef not a fan of sweetmeat keep the sugar for dessert). The chicken teriyaki was really good & although it was sweet I wanted seconds. Some of the Fried tofu was sweet too. \n\nI didn't like the crabmeat Patty it was too bland. The Jeon & the gyeranmari was good: I wanted seconds.The shrimp fried rice was good. I really liked the kimchi esp the zucchini or cucumber 1 ( cant remember which 1).\n\nThe japchae was good. 1 of the Kimbaps was good the other was a bit strange to me I think it was burdock root that has a strange flavor.\n\nFor dessert they have this small red bean bun which was really good. I wish I had taken 1 more." u"My favorite Korean Restaurant! Buffet forever! \n\nLocation: It is located in the heart of Koreatown! Prepare to fall in line during lunch and dinner! It could get really crowded eventhough there is a lot of seating! The buffet counter offers a lot of Korean staple food! There is also a take out corner where you can just grab and go!\n\nService: You will just meet the cashier which both speaks korean and english.\n\nFood: OMG i love everything here! I've been to Korea and the food here is just the same! The buffet section is where I always get my food the buffet has cold and hot food. It is per pound basis so they have to weigh it and then you will pay the price. My personal favorite is the spicy pork tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) kimbap (korean sushi) kimchi rice sweet and sour fried pork omelette japchae(stir fry noodles) and bulgogi! For drinks try Milkis and Vilac Shikhye!\n\nPrice: Inexpensive\n\nFeels like I am in Korea everytime I go here! So good and very affordable!" u"This place has some great authentic Korean food! Lots of options so you can find something you are craving that day. It was my first time here and I opted for the hot and cold food bar which is calculated by weight. I was a little too heavy-handed and ended with $18 worth of food. This place can be cheap but it can also add up! Also this place can get quite crowded and annoying at times so try coming during off hours to beat the rush.\n\nI'm the type of person to get a little bit of everything so I can get a taste of everything and yes everything was good! I really liked their different types of pancakes (I think they had veggie kimchi and crab) and their bulgogi which was surprisingly flavorful. \n\nNext time I will pick the few things that I like from the food bar and maybe buy one of their pre packaged gimbap." u"I dunno.  I like this place.  I've been here once or twice before and it was amazing.  Sadly it was less so when I took a family member here.  They could have just been having an off day and so I will certainly be back to give them another shot.\nIt seems possibly the time of day could be a factor looking at other reviews but we didn't come too late.\n\nI'll be sure to give them another shot and update this taking the next experience into account.\n\nThe buffet offers a nice selection at reasonable prices." u'This place gives me major nostalgia. I used to come here all the time and so many of my nights either ended or started at Woorijip. \n\nI mainly come here to drink and I rarely ate the food so I can\'t really comment on the quality of the food since the last time I ate here was several years ago. However they have a decent variety for their "buffet" which is pay-by-weight. They also have a lot of soups and other dishes that you can heat up in the microwave that is available in the restaurant.  \n\nI think the best part of Woorijip is definitely their drinks. I usually get a bottle of soju and mix it with a can of Milkis. They also have a lot of other sodas and beer. Cheap and efficient way to pregame! \n\nFYI this place can get CROWDED on weekends and you may not find an open table.' u'So cheap so much variety and such a great spot to hang out with friends. \n\nThis place is more like a buffet but charged by pound. They also have a section where you can buy their dishes in a box for cheap prices. Great to carry to work as lunch. \n\nYou pay at the counter so no tips at all. You can go out to get a drink and come back to sit. It is very specious inside. \n\nAwesome place. Would come back if I can. Highly recommend.' u"Key words: (1) korean food buffet by the pound (2) perfect for eating by yourself\n\nThis place's noted for the korean food buffet. It has a cold food section and a hot food section and you pay by how much food you get. In addition to the buffet they offer a variety of prepared foods including Korean fried chicken and soups.\n\nThis place is especially great if you're grabbing a quick bite by yourself or in a small group or if you want to try small bits of a lot of different Korean dishes. The taste overall is okay.\n\nBe sure to keep the flow going. Because it is a buffet it helps to keep moving in the same direction instead of going back. The same for the check out lane. There is always seems to be a fairly long line but the check out staff is fairly fast." u"Cute Korean cafe that serves Korean meals. This is located in Koreatown and opens til 2 am! \n\nGREAT:\n- has a lot of seatings for big families/groups. It's big enough for you to have study sessions here while pigging out at the same time. \n- the food is great! The meat and rice tasted fresh (even when we bought it around at 1:30 AM). The meat wasn't too chewy or too hard. The rice wasn't stale either. \n- you get a free water bottle with a certain purchase! \n- the food is big enough for two people imo. My group had bunch of left overs to take back to our hotel! \n\nGOOD:\n- I personally think some entrees were overpriced such as kimbab that was priced at $5. \n- the location was really hard to find lol. I expected it to be noticeable compared to other restaurants but the sign is kind of tiny and it's in Korean so for those who don't know how to read Korean... good luck haha!" u"Who doesn't go here to get wasted on soju?\n\nIt's THE spot! I swear you can run into your sisters/brothers you didn't know you have or celebrities here. Korean food buffet style cheap sojus and plenty of seatings where you still need to fight someone for. \nAgain it is THE spot. But the food can be sus at the end of the day sometimes I get unlucky and grab something that's already spoiled but you can always let them know pretty good customer service!" u'I like coming here late in the evening when they have their prepared meals on discount. They have a variety of drinks and Korean food here!\n\nOne of the discounted meals I tried was the one with sticky purple rice and beef. It was $3.50 and was filling! The rice was a little tough to chew on (but not a big deal when the meal is cheap)! Also comes with a free item of your choice: soup salad water or kimchi.' u"A bit sick of the food spots by me at Penn Station so I decided to venture out for some yummy authentic and affordable Korean food! It was definitely worth the trip from my building at One Penn Plaza (about a 10-15 mins walk). OMG there were sooooooo many variety bento boxes and small snack boxes. You can also get buffet at $8.99lb. I got a Chicken Cutlet over Vegetable Curry for $6.50 but rice was sold separately so I decided to get a small snack of Scallion and Seafood Pancake for $5.00! Holy moly the line wrapped around the whole restaurant lol...pheww they had a cashier just for cash #score. \n\nI took my food to go and sat in Greeley Square with my colleague but next time I am going to try to eat inside rather do take-out and take advantage of their AC lol\n\nHubba hubba *drools* the chicken cutlet was still crispy and not soggy from the delicious vegetable curry...you really don't need any rice to go with this dish because it's just superbly delicious mmmm \n\nWow the Scallion and Seafood Pancake was topped with mussels squid shrimp and etc but a bit overpowering from the scallions mmmm. Also I love the texture of the pancake. I am such a fan and will make many trips here soon for lunch =)" u'I love this place. The only thing I hate is their credit card limit. Otherwise it is awesome. The food is freshly made and very cheap. This is not a classy place to eat but the food is delicious. You can try a variety of things and leave feeling full.' u'Cheap cheap cheap and yum yum yum. This is sort of a hole in the wall Korean buffet restaurant (nothing fancy) and you seat and serve yourself. Good for a home cooked Korean meal at an inexpensive price.'],0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0
96.Ferris,[u"Hidden gem. This place is awesome. Everything about it makes you feel good. Charles runs a hip friendly and familial front of the house in a cozy and sexy space. \n\nChef works his magic right in front of your eyes in an open kitchen sending out delicious dish after delicious dish. They are small and light so you can try them all. The Mackeral was amazing!!!\n\nGreat date spot and place to bring friends. Don't miss out on the taking the elevator right in the restaurant to the rooftop. Great music and an amazing view of the empire state building right above your head." u"Dimly lit small restaurant with open kitchen good vibes and friendly service. Overall the food is good but a bit too ambitious with certain ingredients. My husband and I had:\n\n- chicharrones with chicken liver mousse - delicious \n- blood sausage with grilled dates - good but my husband wasn't into the way the sausage was presented being crumbled instead of cut in slices\n- octopus with egg custard - I didn't like this dish. The egg custard had a weird taste and the pudding-like texture just didn't work with the small bits of octopus. \n- beets with black sesame tahini and shaved coconut - delicious \n- 23 oz cote de bouef with fixings - a must-try dish. The beef was aged for 60 days and served with flakes of salt and molasses on the side. The fixings included buttermilk foam with charred pearl onions and leek ash (the leek ash did not add any value) dumplings (bland) and slaw. If I had known how filling this dish was I wouldn't have ordered the octopus. \n- chocolate mousse - good but I was so stuffed that my stomach was hurting and couldn't enjoy dessert\n\nCocktails are well balanced and made with love. The Ninth Petal is a subtly floral martini. Melon de Caraibe slightly sweet honeydew drink with egg white. Gold & Delicious is brandy and whisky. All so good.\n\nWe sat at the bar and chatted with Julie the bartender. She's so knowledgeable about different types of liquor. A true professional. Lou Lou (Louise) was our awesome server.\n\nWe'd def come back to try the other dishes." u"Lots of creative dishes here that sound intriguing and can be hit or miss in taste.. and unfortunately portions are small \n\nLocated below street level at Made Hotel. \n\nTried the grilled mackerel served in a small bowl in a flavorful ponzu sauce. The egg yolk and Italian plum were served on the side of the bowl - perhaps to allow diners to mix to their preference. The mackerel with or without the garnishes was juicy and tasty.\n\nThe beets were served atop black sesame tahini sprinkled with young coconut and other nut and veggie toppings. Very creative dish with a basic ingredient (beets!) that is on most menus and this version was my favorite dish of the evening\n\nFor the main got the duck breast cooked medium rare. Texture was chewy a bit dry and too fatty. This was definitely a miss for me.\n\nAlso got the carrot agnolotti (ravioli-like) which was delicious with lamb neck and pickled squash. And the charred broccolini with timur yogurt and cashews  was good although a little heavy on the yogurt\n\nDessert was a 65% dark chocolate mousse with tea meringue - a little bit bitter and a little bit sweet and a whole lot satisfying. \n\nI'm very open-minded when it comes to food- I eat almost anything. I found the menu to be a little too ambitious too exotic to what actually came out. Overall I was generally pleased.. it's only the first month the restaurant's been open. Am confident management will work out kinks and the kitchen can execute and deliver creations that make sense or at least appreciated by diners." u"Came here for the grand opening and was wowed. As a big fan of Le Turtle I was eager to see what Chef Greg Proechel would come up in his new venture at the MADE hotel. I was not disappointed.\n\nThe space is fairly cozy and intimate perfect for a small group or date. There's a nice view of the open kitchen and a seat at the bar will give you an up close and experience with the bartender and inner workings of the food prep.\n\nOnto the food itself. We were lucky enough to try a good amount of the menu much of which has slight Asian leanings and even some French leanings a la Le Turtle. Some of our favorites:\n- Blood sausage with grilled dates: Such a good flavor and texture. A bit if crunchy and the sweetness of the dates really pairs well with the flavor of the blood sausage. Likely my favorite dish of the night\n- Grilled mackerel with egg yolk ponzu and Italian plum: The portion is a little small but the flavors are unbelievable. The richness all melds together well with the sourness of the ponzu and plum and the mackerel does not have too much of a fishy taste/smell.\n- Okinawa Sweet Potato with pumpkin mustard and buttermilk: Super tender and the sweetness pairs well with the tang of the buttermilk\n- C\xf4te de b\u0153uf with all the fixings: The beef is unbelievable but the side of savory whipped cream with onion is the absolute truth. So rich yet light the cream has a flavor similar to sour cream and onion chips. AMAZING.\n- Chocolate mousse with jasmine tea meringue: Very rich and the meringue is tasty and melts in your mouth.\n\nService was excellent overall. The staff is constantly experimenting and improving the menu so they might need help remembering ingredients but overall very happy with the recommendations and descriptions. Prices are pretty good for the portion overall and we were stuffed by the end of it.\n\nDefinitely going to come back soon to try their other dishes. I really enjoy their attitude of always tinkering and trying to improve so it will be interesting to see how the menu might change over time. There's a great essence of quality and attention to detail throughout the whole experience so I'm very excited to see what the future holds for Ferris." u"Fortunate to have dined at Le Turtle (when Executive chef Greg Proechel was there) known for serving one of the best chickens the sasso chicken in the city. Still remember the phenomenal kohlrabi bisque w/ lamb belly which I hope will show up on the menu here.\n\nInexpensive-to-moderately priced (more Japanese-influenced) dinner menu. \nMenu is limited so a group of 4 or 5 can easily order and share everything on the menu.\nDon't expect to find the sasso chicken here but they have the cote de bouef.\n\nHighlight dishes:  All (Grilled mackerel squid w/ melon & pork salumi pork collar w/ black bean sauce (highly recommend) Okinawa sweet potato grilled lobster and carrot agnolotti w/ lamb neck.\nOnly two options for dessert chocolat mousse & almond financier w/ pineapple/coconut tapioca. Tried the latter which was excellent. \n\nExcellent service (Didn't notice any of the hiccups associated w/ a newly opened restaurant).\n\nHighly recommend.\n\n: 9 calendars" u"Cozy restaurant hidden in the basement of Made Hotel.  There were a few communal tables along with smaller tables.  Also had bar seating.  You get a direct view into the kitchen and can see the food being prepared.  Didn't have a res but the host was friendly and able to accommodate our party of 3 Friday night.  Ordered a variety of appetizers including octopus broccolini sweet potato bread &butter fresh cheese.  I love that each dish had a straightforward name-- no guessing as to what you're getting.  Ingredients were fresh and each dish was quite flavorful. Our waiter Chris was accommodating.  We also explored the rooftop bar on 18th floor which had a nice view of the Empire State Building. Drinks were great (Night Flower Gentleman's Directory-- interesting drink names)." u"Note to self: This is my new place when I'm around MSG.  Their burger falls into my top ten all time burgers- meat was delicious cooked to perfection. It was simple and utterly tasty.  Wait staff was incredibly friendly.  Started with the Las Palmas drink which was great.  Then I told my waitress I was under the weather and needed something warm with whiskey.  She made me a gorgeous and comforting night cap.  It seems like you'll need reservations to get into the main downstairs restaurant but the upstairs has plenty of seating (though a limited menu) on this particular Tuesday." u"I was quite bummed that I didnt get to try Le Turtle before the chef left. But damn. Ferris is definitely one of the best spot in the city right now. Reasonably priced situated in a beautiful hotel super friendly services and.. the food. THE FOOD THOUGH. We got the octopus and scallop appetizer 24oz cote de beauf cardamom almond cake and yuzu sorbet as dessert. For two people it's just enough food we are full but not on the border of pukery. The wine prices are reasonable too! Already booking my next visit.." u'Love this place. It has a little bit of everything. Such a cool vibe. Has a downstairs more of a restaurant and a bar upstairs is cafe/coffee in the front and lounge chairs bar in the back.' u'This place is amazing! We ordered the bread and butter mackerel squid broccolini duck and chocolate mouse.' u"Chef Proechel wowed us again. Every dish was thoughtfully made. Our favorite dishes of the night were blood sausage Japanese sweet potato and the Cote de boeuf. The flavors were spot on. I'm still dreaming about that sour cream and onion whipped side that came with the Cote de boeuf -never had anything like that. The menu was very affordable so I highly encourage you to go with a couple of your friends and try as much as you can on the menu. I can't wait to go back!!" u'Blood sausage broccolini lobster and sparkling chenin Blanc at the cozy bar is the best combo ever. Mezcal cocktails are amazing too!' u'Had a lovely meal at Ferris on my girls night out. DJ served us. He is super helpful from our cocktails to all of our dishes everything we had was very unique in its own way. This is a 16 day old restaurant and I see great things happening here. Cannot wait to go back!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
74.Green Symphony,[u"Heaven. This place is a total gem in an area that's loaded with McDonald's and tourist traps. I enjoy a smoothie in the morning that has any kind of greens healthy fat fiber and protein - Green Symphony has all that and more! \n\nAll the baked goods look tasty and I can't wait to come back in the morning. If you're traveling for work this is a great way to stay healthy if you must stay near Times Square." u'This small health food store - a few blocks from Times Square - not only has a very good buffet @$7.50 a pound - it\'s so off the radar that it maintains an impossible local feel - with an easy vibe more fit for Hawaii.\n\nThe staff and owners are not only very friendly and kind the buffet has healthy clean homemade food including brown rice vegetarian options salad and proteins. \n\nA wide assortment of Vegan vegetarian and healthier desserts like cookies and "bars" that taste homemade round out the picture.   There is a small sitting area that usually has free tables.\n\nSmoothies \nAtmosphere - kind of hippy \nFood - healthy and of good value' u"If you are a health conscious individual or a vegetarian this is a great place to get lunch or some snacks. If you are not I would not recommend eating at Green Symphony; there are a few tables the space is small and the interior is rather old and run-down. \n\nIf you are gluten- free be careful! Many of their baked goods are wheat free but not necessarily gluten- free. Additionally their gluten free baked goods are not the best but not the worst. \n\nWouldn't recommend this place for the gluten-free crowd but definitely for the health conscious who are looking for a quick lunch!" u'I walked by this place last week when I went to the taco place down the street and looked at the menu. I was astonished to find sandwiches and wraps under $7 and smoothies under $6! In New York City Manhattan and MIDTOWN specifically this place is a true GEM! I ordered the Vegan Chili and Parisian Dream Wrap today through Seamless and was not disappointed! The serving size is perfect the food is warmed up nicely and the presentation is nice.' u"I enjoy this place a little too much.  I was exposed to Green Symphony while on the hunt for some natural wholesome fare in Midtown a land that is largely health-averse.  This place is a culinary treasure for those who want a delicious feel-good lunch with hearty greens and well-prepared protein dishes.  The grilled teriyaki chicken thighs are delicious (if you can grab them in time!).  The samosas are always piping hot the vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes all well-prepared running the gamut from chicken salad with apple and raisins to their tasty kale salad.  On every visit I'd largely ordered from their hot bar and depending on the temperature outside may go for one of their smoothies.  The gingersnap smoothie was cool and refreshing with a nice undercurrent of ginger without being overpowering.  You may find chunks of ice and bits of pear still left whole in the drink but I let that slide considering the crazy line for their smoothies.\n\nLunch is not cheap per usual and by 2pm you're scraping for leftovers in trays that don't look like they'll be replenished. The space is also very compact with me usually waiting around awkwardly for my smoothie while making sure I don't knock over the odd table for straws and napkins. But every time I'd left feeling immensely proud and excited to delve into the deliciousness that awaited me and that's a good sign of a great find." u'I felt like I was living in a world of gray when I ate my order. Where did the flavor go? Just because the food is vegan doesn\'t mean pizzazz should be discarded.\n\nI ordered the vegan protein salad and acai blueberry bar. The salad was good--hearty portions  and interesting mix of textures. Flavors were overall lacking though. I liked the somewhat crispy smoky-flavored "bacon" made from tempeh the curried chickpeas and the saut\xe9ed mushrooms (wish there were more of them). Lots of peas and tofu (which were somewhat bland). Also wish there were more romaine salad greens as opposed to quinoa which just filled one up. \n\nThe acai blueberry bar was very dense. While I often appreciate desserts that aren\'t too sweet so that you can enjoy natural flavors particularly with fruit this bar again lacked brightness. Were they using some kind of stevia sweetener?  Not recommended.' u"Food is 4 stars but service is lacking. This place was confusing when I came in so I asked if I could do the buffet which a BUFFET normally means you get all that you want to eat where I'm from but they charge by the pound which is fine but I asked if I paid before or after and they could have let me know before I loaded up my plate or put a sign out Most of my food was good but not all the turkey meatballs were gross." u"I hate to give such a vegan-friendly local shop a low rating but after giving Green Symphony multiple chances my opinion just hasn't budged.\n\n***LOCATION & INTERIOR**\nGreen Symphony is located in the Theater District on a relatively deserted street that always smells like pee but that's just the nature of the area I guess.\n\nAnyway Green Symphony is pretty small with some rickety tables and seats in a corner and the rest of the space taken up by some shelves of food (including some ready-made grab-and-go food) the front counter that holds baked goods and a hot bar in the back. They carry a selection of healthy vegan gluten-free etc. snacks from chips to cookies to bars--basically all the popular brands. Prices are reasonable.\n\nThe whole shop is very dingy and old though. It's in dire need of some renovations: the tables are always sticky and dirty it smells musty inside and everything is cluttered and sort of disorganized.\n\n***FOOD***\nWhen I saw the display case full of fresh baked goods (they cook them in house!) at the front counter I was so excited. About half of the options were vegan! And all of them use healthy natural ingredients minimal processed sugar etc. As a lover of desserts I thought I had hit gold with all of these seemingly guilt-free sweets.\n\nUnfortunately that didn't turn out to be the case. I've tried a lot of their vegan bars and other baked goods and not a single one was good. The acai blueberry bar was as hearty as others have said--it was legitimately heavy and so dense--but barely had any taste. Just a dry mess of muted blueberry flavor and absolutely no acai flavor. The almond bar I got another time was just as heavy and dense and also just as dry and flavorless. I understand they're trying to limit added sugar but they could've added SOME sweetness with natural sweeteners like maple syrup or agave. \n\nAnd besides the bars weren't guilt-free at all. They were so huge and hearty that they must've been at least 500-600 calories each and way too heavy on the carbs with the tightly packed grain bases.\n\nTheir hot bar food is average as well although it could be good if you work in the area and want some healthy diverse food. Just make sure to give your plate a spin in the microwave before eating because like most hot bars the food gets cold and starts sticking together.\n\n***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***\nI don't know...the concept is good and you won't find a mom and pop vegetarian/vegan shop like this anywhere nearby but the actual food is disappointing. They really need to give the shop a facelift and rethink some of their recipes." u'Amazing yummy desrts!Every time I am in New York I stop there.The food and smoothies are great too.Love this place.' u"Had a decent salad here. I'd say it's on par with Chop't but not as good as Sweetgreen. I did the build your own with avocado beets and roasted chickpeas but the chickpeas were really hard - I think they were overdone. Fast delivery to my midtown office. 3.5 stars." u'I got the bacon bowl which was everything I was hoping for and more... Also got the Energy Bee juice which was delicious! Will definitely be going back again through my stay in the city!' u"This place is like an organic gourmet bodega. There is a salad bar as well as another hot and cold food buffet with lots of healthy options. I liked everything I got except for the brown rice. I also got one of their homemade bar/breads. The banana blueberry bread made with oatmeal flour was so good and I can't wait to try some of the other bars.\n\nThere was an autographed photo of Daniel Craig in this store - kind of exciting that James Bond also likes this place!" u"Terrible delivery service. Delayed for an hour than scheduled time. I understand it is hard to handle a group order. But if they can not make it they shouldn't guarantee that. In general a pretty bad experience with this restaurant. Will never order from it again." u'Great! I can always count on a healthy lunch at Green symphony! Clean and tasty! Conveniently packed salads and healthy sweet treats cookies and bars. Very healthy green food!' u'Vegetarian and regulartarians paradise. They have a list of so many good smoothies a hot bar cold bar and salad bar. You can mix and match and they just weigh it by the pound. \nThey also have different healthy snacks and drinks you can purchase like a mini-trader joes.' u"Those who want to take a healthy lunch break should consider Green Symphony. A super tiny independently-owned salad bar/smoothie bar/deli that packs a great selection off their menu and buffet stations. They offer a ton of natural fruit and vegetable smoothies and drinks. If you check out their full menu they have specialty items like rice bowls (containing brown rice only) creative wraps creative salads and so forth. The options are simply great. They offer delivery and pick-up for your convenience. \n\nWhile they have their buffet stations I just go straight to ordering off their menu. I've tried a good share of their options which includes the Sesame Tofu Steak Salad Tofu Mania Bowl Chicken Bowl New Yorker Bowl and the Dalai Lama Bowl. Their salads range about $7-10 and I think they are pretty fair price-wise. The portions are very good and they come with plenty of the toppings that are being offered. Regarding the 'Bowls' they are simply rice bowls that come with a variety of different toppings (much like bibimbap). They strictly use brown rice for these and none of the ingredients are fried. It's my personal favorite to order when I get lunch from here if not the wraps. The smoothies and speciality mixed drinks packed with only healthy ingredients are also worth the try. They have an extensive smoothies menu that is probably the best I have encountered around here.\n\nGreen Symphony is definitely one of my favorite hidden deli spots. Vegetarians/vegans would particularly love this spot because they offer so much in terms of non-meat options. Good healthy and reasonably priced food does exist in Times Square and this spot has consistently proven that on my several visits for lunch." u"If you want a brilliant natural hole in the wall this is the place to go! They have a buffet that is to die for! All the ingredients are listed and it's fresh! Wow what a good place to give life!!!" u'They sent me a burned B.L.T.\n\nWhat kind of restaurant give their customer a sandwich with a total BURNED bread? It tastes only burned. \n\nUnbelievable. Really disappointed.' u"If you're into healthy & organic foods and need to pick up quick office snacks a delicious smoothie or desk lunch there's no place better in Midtown West (I'm also fond of Westerly Market but this spot has more fresh food options). There are tables that you can eat at (maybe seats 12-15 max?) but in my mind this is more of a takeout joint. The owners here believe in the importance of healthy eating so I trust the quality of their cold/hot bar foods.  Will visit over and over again.\n\nBibimbap here is made with brown rice just a heads up--they don't even keep white rice in the store" u"This place is straight up a miracle to find something this healthy and this affordable smack in the middle of times Square is definitely the diamond in the rough. I've had several of their sandwiches their veggie roasted wrap is by far my favorite and all of the smoothies especially the AFI is to die for  but don't die just order your food and carry-on."],-0.7783,0.047,0.771,0.182
181.Osteria Al Doge,[u'Our party of nine enjoyed a great meal here recently.  We were two groups traveling from different parts of the city but we were accommodated as we arrived.  The dining room is well designed for large parties but we also noticed that there were several more intimate areas of the restaurant for smaller groups or couples.\n\nFor adult beverages we started with excellent Negronis and Old Fashioneds mixed and serve perfectly; so good we had a second round!\n\nBecause of the size of our party we were able to sample several dishes including excellent Caesar salads Arancini Carpaccio for starters.  Entrees included delicious creamy Gnocchi wonderful mushroom Risotto excellent Seafood Risotto Grilled Branzino Lasagne Bolognese Roasted Pork Loin and Veal Scallopini!  Each dish was as good (if different) from the next and we would recommend them all.  We are looking forward to returning to try new items!\n\nAfter a long meal and a great visit we enjoyed a Limoncello and coffee and Affogato for dessert.  All-in-all this was a meal to remember!\n\nThank you Osteria Al Doge for the great visit and for allowing us to have such a memorable time with our friends and family!' u'What a way to kick off a weekend in New York! Black hand made spaghetti with calamari capers minced garlic  sun roasted tomatoes in a bolognese sauce. A treat for my palate! \n\nThis restaurant was recommended by a local and I am so very glad we listened. It was very inviting atmosphere. Friendly staff and attentive. \n\nThey brought out a beautiful Tiramisu with a candle for me!  \n\nI would recommend this restaurant and will be back on my next visit to New York!' u'Wonderful dinner after a horrible show. \nWe saw 1984.  \nWalked across the street to Osteria al Doge - it was excellent.  The staff was so nice - our waitress Ramona was exceptional.  So attentive - so informative.  The meal was excellent.  A great find in this busy area.  Definitely a recommend.  The pizza was out of this world as were the raviolis.' u"This is a good spot before a show and has a romantic atmosphere. Perfect for a date night and a show. Ask for a seat on the balcony overlooking the main dining area. Food isn't bad and they make sure they get you out on time for your show. Try the lasagna. Pretty decent" u"Osteria al Doge\n\nWe came here before our 8p show.  If you are going around show time definitely have a reservation. The hostess was lovely and we were seated right away. Our waiter Rex was very nice and helpful with suggestions.  He recommended a really\nyummy French martini. We got the grilled octopus the pasta quartto formaggi and the manicotti (which was on the special's list) and we got the tiramisu for dessert. The whole meal was delicious! Paced perfectly and we got to our show on time. I highly recommend it." u"We dined here before heading to our Broadway show. It was only about two blocks from the show so it was incredibly convenient.\n\nTo start we had the fresh mozzarella at the suggestion of our server (service was great although a bit inattentive at times based on the volume). It was just okay - nothing too special going on with this cheese.\n\nAs entrees I had the special a pappardelle with mushrooms and shrimp and while the flavor was wonderful I expected more from the restaurant in terms of the shrimp. They were the smallest size of shrimp (I don't know that I've ever had shrimp served so small in a restaurant) and there were maybe three. Other than that it was very delicious. My SO ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was very good. \n\nWe didn't order dessert because we wanted to grab some cheesecake from Juniors afterwards but it did look delicious. It's a very cramped space so be prepared for that." u"Grazie. Grazie mille! I do not believe I've encountered an Italian place where I loved every bite of the food that was served in front of my face. This place cannot be beat! We had the grilled octopus clams and mussels special porcini mushroom risotto of the day special pappardelle with lobster of the day and three desserts (yes 3 for the 2 of us because we couldn't decide). Of the three desserts I suggest getting the lemon tart; it's well-balanced and I can't say no to lemony sweets. \n\nNote: You might want to let your server know that you are not rushing to a show because they'll speed everything through as if you are. My hat's off to those who are considerate with time but I'm here to relax not chow through and go to a show so please slow down with my dining experience. Grazie :)" u"The Quick: One of the best pre-theater options in Midtown. The octopus appetizer is out of this world. Family run authentic Italian food and ambiance. \n\nThe Details: Would I normally come to midtown for an Italian dinner? Of course not. But if you're going to see a show this is a phenomenal option. The food is delicious the owner is charming and overall ambience is relaxed and accommodating. As seen in my pictures we tried almost everything; and one was better than the next.\n\nPro Tip: If you are going to see a play definitely make a reservation! They get very busy\n\nThe Damage: Full meal ~ $30 a person" u"Our myriad appetizers: two kinds of bruschetta a caesar salad served in a bowl made of fried parm (think taco bowl) and grilled octopus were all excellent. Sadly my seafood stew was not similarly up to stuff with a fair amount of overcooked shrimp and tough calamari.\n\nStill I'm going with 4 stars because I was able to also try my friend's pastas and they all seemed quite solid and that I had just chosen poorly." u'Ate here pre-show for Beautiful matinee.  Had a chicken sandwich nothing special.  Last time I ate here had a special which was very good.  Service was prompt.' u"Great place!! The staff is super professional and I didn't have to wait for a table they have a lot of room. The setup is beautiful quiet with enough space.\n\nThe menu is very diverse with many great options. The fresh pasta with meat was delicious and the dessert amazing! They also have many great wines." u'I lunched here and ordered the bisteca di manzo and it was subpar quality.  I shoulda known better and ordered pasta since I am at an Italian establishment.  Al doge needs to up their game for dishes other than pasta.  My colleague ordered the salmon pasta and it looked really good.\nThe baby grilled octopus was ok nothing special.  Calamity calamari was nothing exceptional.  Maybe I come and give it one more try next time for the pasta and see if it is any better.' u"Very nice place. Creative menu items inviting ambiance. Especially nice to visit if you're going to a Broadway show. \n\nWe had an octopus for our appetizer. Ordered the spinach pasta with lamb. And a French martini which was spot on. I would definitely go again if it in the area." u'Had dinner here with 6 other guests 4:30 on a Sunday.  The ambience is classy and rustic.  I found the service slightly perfunctory and one of our orders came out incorrectly but it was quickly and satisfactorily rectified.  The food was excellent all around and they did not rush us out.  I highly recommend.' u'So while staying at the Iroquois the concierge recommended this place on our first night.  Unfortunately we did not go there till our last evening. My mistake.  Great Italian food served by a knowledgeable and attentive wait staff.  My wife got the seafood pasta (++++) and I ordered the salmon.  Gawd!  Great food!  Maybe we got lucky - but we will return.  By the way - the captain came by our table to ask if there was ANYTHING that could be done to improve our experience.  --- he already knew my answer!' u"I just had lunch here with my coworkers and it was so great. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu so there is a good variety and the portions are generous. I'm back at the office and I don't feel like I'm falling asleep (which so often happens after lunch out) so that's a definite plus. \n\nI had the pasta fagioli as an appetizer the lemon chicken for my entree and the tiramisu for dessert. All were absolutely delicious. \n\nService was friendly and attentive but not in your face and the interior design feels very Tuscan and laid back yet still charming. \n\nMy office is right around the corner and I cannot wait to come back!" u'Third time here once again watch out for the big rush they probably look for one hour turnaround.\nWe also noticed the food came out minutes after ordering leaving us to suspect it was already made and just reheated.  Food appeared to have been sitting as pasta was already dry and food was not served piping hot.  Desert was not impressive.  We like the convenient location and the food does tastes good.' u'Nice little place to grab a bite or drink before/after seeing a show. Friendly staff gives off a nice vibe.' u'This food is Venetian and fabulous as is the service. The menu is manageable and reasonably priced. Nothing on the menu is heavy and sauced and reflects the culture of Venice. The location makes it accessible and is not touristy at all!' u"This is a great pre-show/Times Square (non-chain) spot!  I would recommend it!  The service was excellent and she even asked if we were going to see show so the kitchen would presumably expedite our order with 15 minutes to spare!\n\nWe ordered the goat cheese and beet salad the burrata and a pasta dish with shrimp (I can't remember the name but it had giant ziti-like pasta)\n-Cant go wrong with burrata and it had a good amount of cherry tomatoes and arugula.\n-The pasta was the best dish cooked perfectly al dente with a lot of shrimp and spinach and just enough sauce.\n-The salad had too much spinach about 2 beets cut into quarters and 2 slices of goat cheese."],0.923,0.151,0.792,0.057
175.Guacamole Mexican Restaurant,[u"Super nice new neighborhood gem. We just went for cocktails (this time). They were delicious service is excellent and the place is beautiful. I can definitely recommend the mezcal cocktails.\n\nCan't wait to go back for the food!" u"Umm not sure how to review this so I'll give it 3 stars. Probably just went on an off night. We got seated right away but ended up waiting 2 hours for food. Literally two hours. They kept giving us weird excuses as to why -- kitchen too busy made a mistake etc. --  but we saw other tables come in eat and leave. \n\nFood was OK decent shrimp tacos salmon etc. The waiter seemed genuinely sorry so probably just a bunch of things that went wrong. \n\nThey offered a round of drinks (only 2 out of 5 were drinking though so we passed) and didn't offer any appetizers. \n\nI'd say give it a try if you live close by. They are new and possibly don't have it all together yet. The food was decent and they seemed like nice people." u'It was the freaking worst! It started with the waitress asking if I wanted my margarita on the rocks. I asked for it blended. She said "we don\'t do that." Okay...why did she ask if I wanted it on the rocks again?? So I ordered an enchilada. I received a plate of pork wrapped in corn tortillas. There was no cheese! Listen the whole point of enchiladas is cheese so WTF?! I asked if I could get something else instead. The waitress insisted that those were "traditional Mexican enchiladas." Lady no! So I order a burrito instead asking if they can do it open faced not in a tortilla. "We don\'t do that." Okay...\n\nThe burrito had about three beans in it. The rest was rice and fatty pork. I had three bites and gave up.' u'I just moved to the neighborhood and I\'ve been going to Blockheads and Cafe Frida to get my fix of "Mexican" food and this place tops both of them!  There\'s a decent sized menu and so many good items to choose from.  We got a chimichanga(beef) and burrito(chicken and chorizo) and both were fantastic!  Food was good and will be going back here more often.   Happy hour is also from 3pm to 7pm!  They have an outdoor backyard space but I believe it\'s closed for the season.\n\nI will say however the Guacamole sign in front of the store is slightly deceiving because it looks like a sign a bodega or corner deli would have.  I promise once you actually walk in it\'s an amazing atmosphere!   \n\nAgain it\'s a great addition to UWS!' u'Food is four stars.  Guacamole appetizer despite coming out halfway through our entrees was good.  Barbacoa was ok a bit gamey. Chorizo was great. \n\nService is 1 star.  Made us pay for drinks ordered at the bar in the middle of meal instead of waiting until end or transferring over.  Food took forever to come out and per above appetizer guacamole came out after entrees.  Spilled margarita from pitcher.  Lost credit card (second time it happened in same evening). Worst part is they were unapologetic.' u'This is their unofficial opening night and no alcohol service. The official grand opening and alcohol service are Monday 9/25/2017. That said ...\n\nService is very attentive. They offer a great variety of tacos that match or exceed many taquerias I have recently patronized. The portions are very generous. \n\nOur two orders of House Tacos - $16/order each with 3 tacos - left use wanting more but unable to eat another bite. All were flour (soft corn taco is an option) and included hanger steak shrimp octopus and octopus with Mexican sausage. We tremendously enjoyed and highly recommend the "Pulpo" (octopus) taco and "Pulpo Y Chorizo" (Octopus and Mexican sausage) taco. We\'re returning to try more tacos their signature "guacamole" dinner and drinks.' u'This replaces several Mexican restaurants in the same location. Hopefully this one sticks. Cafe Frida which still exists near the Nat His Museum has gone downhill and the food at Guacamole is similar but better.\n\nThe prices are high-ish but not absurd for the size of portions quality and taste. The tortillas appear to be fresh and the guacamole is tasty as it better be when it\'s your restaurant\'s name.\n\nDelivery was fast packaged well and still hot. I would definitely recommend the fajitas and the vegetarian tacos. The steak in the fajitas while not "rare" was still tender and not overcooked. The shrimp were plentiful as well. The tacos were overflowing and very flavorful not bland spices.\n\nOverall this is a welcome new addition to the upper upper west side aka Manhattan Valley.' u'Me and my fianc\xe9 had a great time in this establishment food was awesome  place was nice & cozy . The employees was helpful  very pleasant.The food was delicious and very much on point . The drinks was nice & cold and did the job. Me and my fianc\xe9 will definitely will go back for another awesome evening ..thanks guys for all your hospitality..' u"I absolutely love this place.. The food was fresh and not heavy.. The drinks where really good.. The hospitality was amazing.. The server was very friendly didn't make us feel rush made us feel very welcomed  and the manager of the place was extremely friendly. I would definitely come back." u"Ordered delivery from this place. Got a chorizo tostada and the chicken nachos. Tostada didn't have lettuce but was tasty very similar to the vampiros they serve in LA. The nachos were just as good the chips werent soggy at all and tasted great. Overall it was very impressive for delivery. Can't wait to try more of their menu" u'We got to this place right before the kitchen was closing and let me tell you the food was excellent. The shrimp nachos the steak was well done but so damn juicy and the sauces that came with was finger licking good. I had a virgin mojito and my in law had the chicken quesadilla with a passionfruit margarita that she also loved. The churros was to perfect ending to the meal.' u'This is a great new spot! We stumbled in for lunch and was greeted by such lovely waitress Kadiatou. She was so nice and pleasant. I then ordered 3 tacos: steak shrimp red snapper - amazing. The margaritas were amazing as well! Will definitely return!' u"We just came here on a whim on a Tuesday. Food and drinks were really good! Had the hangar steak which was cooked perfectly. The place was pretty dead which definitely won't last long. We'll definitely come back for their $15 plus entree bottomless brunch this Sunday." u'Just opened and we loved it! Enjoyed a very good dinner with complimentary chips and salsas chicken enchiladas and a beef quesadilla and drinks (Anejo Margarita and the Machete were two favorites). The food was all delicious nicely presented and extremely fresh. Also memorable was a genuinely warm welcome from the staff and manager. This will become a new neighborhood staple for us - and somewhere I would also go out out of my way to eat at. Glad Guacamole has arrived.' u"As soon as I walked in I was welcomed with a warm small. Found this spot on my way home and the adorable decor lured me in luchadores masks and newspaper wallpaper with wall sized paintings. My waitress Stephanie offered amazing recommendations and provided me with samples of the horchata and the hibiscus water before I made a decision. The chips are homemade and the accompanying dips taste fresh. I ordered the shrimp tacos and was blown away. Wonderful restaurant can't wait to come back and I haven't left yet!!" u'This was a great place we stumbled upon.\nWe were greeted by the owner very nice. He told us he has only been open for 3 weeks. I am sure they will do well!\n The staff was excellent.  The food was very good and big portions. We were both stuffed when we left... We will come back for another great meal.\nI do have a suggestion... think about adding Tortilla soup to your menu..   \nBest of luck with your new place.' u'So happy this place has opened! The margaritas are on point and only $6 on happy hour. Our server was Stephanie and she walked us through the menu and asked questions to get feedback. I recommend the tamales or empanadas. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!' u"The atmosphere at Guacamole is great. It has a bar area in the front with some tall tables and a dining space towards the back. The drink menu has many options just no frozen margaritas. The food is great definitely getting what you pay for. Very flavorful with large portions. The staff is great and very attentive. If you're on the Upper West Side and looking for a good Mexican food place I highly recommend it.  The pork tacos and pork nachos are at the top of my list!" u'Tried this restaurant a few weeks after it opened. The staff is friendly and attentive. The manager came to the table to introduce himself and thank us for coming and I noticed him walking through the restaurant making sure everything was satisfactory. The food was excellent and true to Mexican cuisine. Beside the usual tacos enchilladas quesadillas etc there were interesting inventive delicious main courses. Since the restaurant was new we ignored the slow kitchen but hope that improves with time since I see this place being full for quite some time.' u"I had a solid enchilada. Didn't try it yet but the bottomless mimosas seems like a really good deal."],0.8196,0.407,0.593,0.0
28.TYME Food,[u'What a wonderful concept fresh fast food while on the run. Sorry meat lovers no cows or chickens here!  Perfect spot for vegans in the heart of Times Square.  Pop up location definitely an upgrade from a food truck. \n\nThe entrees sold here come in plastic containers that are encouraged to be reused and recycled.  Consider it a coupon because if you bring back to Tyme you are given a $1 off your next purchase. Talk about reducing your carbon foot print. \n\nSeveral entrees are available to choose from. They offer additional sides like veggie chips and healthy beverages.  I elected for the Mexican option primarily for the black beans and guacamole. The food was fresh with authentic natural flavor.  \n\nThere is limited seating as it is in middle of the capital of the world. LoL The great thing is this food is made to travel so feel free to go anywhere you want to eat! Only disappointment  they ran out of utensils!' u"I was on my way to get a slice of pizza when I happened upon this pop up!  Boy was I happy I stopped. I work on Broadway and the only healthy food is two long avenues away on 9th.   I had the Carrot Hummus jar and it was so filling and delicious.  I forgot to eat for another 8 hours!  I can't wait to try the other flavors."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
107.Urbanspace Vanderbilt,[u"Nyc has an assortment of food halls. Vanderbilt adds to them without any disappointment. It's not as large as some but it has plenty of options for a meal. I stopped by to check it out recently and decided upon Delaney Chicken. You have to appreciate a restaurant that does something so well that they don't bother giving you a ton of options. \n\nThe space in general is appealing. A good amount of tables to eat whether at a high top or seated tables. Within walking distance to the trains also is a nice perk." u"I LOVE THIS PLACE. \n\nI think this is the only thing I liked about my hotel in NYC it was conveniently located right next to it (The Roosevelt). I stopped in a few times with my group I was visiting NYC with and everyone left satisfied. They have something for everyone's food cravings. There's also a juice bar and a coffee bar here! \n\nMy personal faves were:\nLiquiteria \nGood Stock \nKBBQ\n\nOne thing we did have trouble with was seating. There's not enough communal seating here. They have shared picnic tables and then these long high top tables that you stand and eat at. During lunch time we actually stood and ate for majority of our time here until a large party got up and we jumped to grab the table immediately." u"Love that you're able to pick and choose from a large diverse smattering of food. Lobster rolls ramen pizza and more! There's literally something for everyone here. Fiance and I stopped in and tried a sampling of just about everything. \n\nBee sting from Roberta's was probably the most memorable. Absolutely unreal. Just wish they had bigger sizes. :( The lobster roll i had was just meh forgot the vendor. Price point is average for NYC for the portioning. great place for groups since everyone can pick and choose then congregate at a table if available." u"Popular trendy food court with plenty of healthy options and gluten free selections. My Husband got a small burger and I chose a breakfast burrito from La Palapa. The service wasn't overly friendly there and it was a bit overpriced in my opinion at $10 and tasted alright but I wouldn't order it again. We shared a cupcake and a gluten free peanut butter cookie from Ovenly. Very friendly service there and deserts were both yummy! \nI wrapped up with a cappuccino from Toby's Estate which was amazing and made to perfection. We will definitely come back next time we are in the city and check out some of the other spots within." u"I love food halls so I might be a little bias but this establishment offers many great choices and is in a prime location. It gets pretty packed during lunch/dinner since it's surrounded by many offices but I would endure the crowds to come here. There are many options here from sweet to savory and most of the vendors offer beer/wine options.\n\nI came here around 6pm peak happy hour time to find that it wasn't as crazy as I expected. The prices for everything are about average for a typical foodcourt but the food lived up to expectations since everything was pretty tasty. The Kuro Obi ramen was super flavorful! Even though it was hard finding a place to actually sit if you wait long enough you can grab a table just as people are leaving. I would definitely return to try the other vendors here!" u'I just love the selection of places to eat  and I especially love Roberta\'s! Their wood fired pizzas are probably the nicest and the freshest in the city. \n\nWe got the axl Rosenberg which was good but I missed reading about the "double garlic" in this pizza which was like "woahh punch-in-your-face" garlicy flavor. Can\'t blame Roberta\'s for this because if I had requested for less garlic they would have been happy to oblige as they are with everything else.\n\nGreat space great food.. wish it was open longer! \n\nUpdate- Had the tomyum noodle soup with porkbelly and peanuts  and it was maybe one of the most satisfying lunches I have had and maybe the only time I didn\'t suffer heartburn after  perfect balance of spice and flavor!' u"Love this place! Casual and yet still classy vibe. Came here for lunch with a friend on a Tuesday. It's crowded but people eat pretty quickly and leave so you can get seats after a short wait. They have standing tables too for those who are too hungry to wait for a table. They had tons of options for food including Thai ramen Chinese Mexican Greek and American. There's something for everyone send most things are $10-15 which isn't too bad for NYC Midtown. I got the spicy ground chicken with rice from the Thai stall and it was super flavorful! A bit too spicy for me so I got teary. Portions were pretty big and I couldn't finish. Would definitely come back again and try the famous ramen place." u"Great food court! So many yummy options.. savory sweet and drinks!\n\nLots of choices from almost every cuisine: german Japanese Korean fried chicken lobster rolls donuts etc etc.\n\nMost things were reasonably priced too!\n\nI had one bad experience here: going to Roberta's (pizza place) and getting the bee sting pizza. It was not very flavorful was really lacking on toppings and wayy too expensive.\n\nEverything else that I've had was great tho. I highly recommend getting anything from Delaney chicken. Everything I've had from them was amazing!" u"I've been here twice since I was working at a client near by. Thankfully I came around 1:30/2 each time so it was as crowded as it could be. There isn't much seating so be prepared to take your food and go or risk possibly standing around waiting for a table to clear up.\n\nThe first time I came here I decided to try Delaney's Chicken. I went for the spicy chicken sandwich as I like a little heat. It comes with a spicy mayo sauce pickles and of course chicken on a bun. The piece of chicken I got was huge and far exceeded my bun lol. The chicken was tender and not dry at all. I wish the sauce had more of a kick to it. It was just okay. The chicken also had dark meat which I kind of wish I knew but it was still pretty delicious.\n\nThe second time I came I decided to try to taco place one/two stores away. I went for the lunch special which consisted of two tacos and pico&guac or rice&beans. I got a steak taco and chicken taco (medium spice) and then pico and guac which also came with a bag of chips. It costs about $12/$13 but was very filling. The meat was good and the sauce had a little kick to it. I think I might try the hot salsa next time I come. The food was delicious and well prepared and fast.\n\nMy next food items I want to try are the donuts as well as Roberta which has some killer looking pizza!" u"My girlfriends and I came to Urbanspace Vanderbilt while touring NY because we were staying in the area and because we all wanted different things. This was a great place to come - a delicious food court where you can't really go wrong. Between the three of us we tried the ramen from Kuro Obi and some tacos from La Palapa doughnuts from Dough and coffee from Toby's estate.\n\nI have to admit that my review is based mostly on La Palapa. While the ramen was okay I didn't find anything extraordinary about it and I've certainly had better. I'm not a fan of doughnuts so I skipped that though my girlfriends tell me they enjoyed it. And Toby's like the ramen was just okay. But the tacos... oh those unassuming tacos. They were incredible! Perhaps because I had underestimated how good they could possibly be but they turned out to be pretty amazing. My favourite was hands down the pineapple pork... just delicious. And the guys behind the counter seemed to really enjoy what they do making the entire experience that much more enjoyable." u"I really like the vibe of this foodcourt. Its a chill place where people go for drinks & food. \n\nIt happened that I was around the area for lunch on a friday afternoon & thanks to yelp for bringing me to this place. Theirs good choices of food from tacos thai food pizza ramen lobster beer wine & many more. I like the interior of this place. It looks chill & very casual. \n\nUpon walking around we decided to get pizza from robertas. We got their small millenium falco- its meaty cheesy with onion. We really enjoyed each bite of it. I rarely eat pizza but this one is yummy! We got 3 tacos the pork al pastor chicken tanga & steak carne asada from lapalapa taco bar. It was okay. Not the best taco but not bad too. For drinks we got iced coffee & thai iced tea from bangkok bar. Taste like the usual thai iced tea & coffee. \n\nIf I'll be around the area next time I'll for sure visit this place again." u'Don\'t come here at lunch.  Maybe don\'t come here at lunch if you have never been here before.  The wall to wall people combined with all of the choices made for a frustrating "wandering around to see what there is and decide what I want and find a place to perch" experience.  \nThe choices are phenomenal the energy is invigorating (and exhausting) and the food is delicious.  Totally worth a stop - just go prepared.' u"This place is great. Its not usually that crowded. Its centrally located. And it has a very wide variety of food including beer. Most of the places are a little pricey for what they are (stalls in a food court) but nothing is more than $15 which isn't that big a deal for lunch or dinner and a good time. The best part of the food court style is everyone can get what they like. I like the Hong Kong cart the dessert place and the ramen place." u"What can I say? If you can't find it here you aren't hungry especially at lunch and dinner time if you are looking for something healthy and quick.\n\nThis is a good spot to roll by when I'm heading back to my hotel from work. There's a wide variety of shops that offer everything from smoothies to fried chicken to sushi that's good healthy  and relatively inexpensive for the area.\n\n\nSo far my favorite spots are KBBQ Dulaney's Dough and this smoothie spot. I find myself going to all of them for a variety of reasons. I have a few more spots to check out. \n\nIf you don't wanna roll out that night or need a quick lunch and you're in the area hit me up!" u"Love this place! I come here almost every single day for lunch for the past 5 months since it's right across from my job and If I'm craving a certain cuisine chances are they have it. \n\nIt's essentially a food court with a wide variety of artisan vendors such as Delaney Chicken Roberta's pizza Goodstock soup Takumi tacos La Palapa tacos Mr. Bing Toby's Estate coffee Burgers Two Tablespoons etc.. so you've got your burgers pizza sushi burritos Mexican Thai salads ramen soups juices Greek Mediterranean lobster rolls BBQ beer/ wine and so forth. \n \nAt lunchtime starting from 12-1:30 it is extremely busy and you may not find a seat although I always make sure to squeeze in somewhere since I lunch alone. If you're with more people finding a table will be challenging between those hours but you can stand. \nThe service is super quick even during the rush hours so don't worry about being held up. \n\nBasically come in get your food eat here (or take it to go) get out. No fuss." u"I have been dying to stop here for lunch since I first stumbled upon it on Yelp. Finally while in the area I made my way over for a quick bite. This food court is conveniently located a block behind Grand Central Terminal which I think is convenient but can imagine that it gets super busy. I went during the afternoon and must have missed the lunchtime happy hour because it was relatively empty. \n\nThere are a bunch of different shops set up inside and you can walk around and pick and choose from however many you'd like. The prices for each individual vendor were reasonable to me and typical for midtown Manhattan. I tried a traditional chicken sandwich from Delaney Chicken and while it was good it wasn't as crispy as I had imagined while drooling over IG pics of it. I also tried a hibiscus donut from DOUGH and it was AMAZING and huge. So don't leave here without a donut for later." u"We came here on a Wednesday afternoon at 1pm and the food hall was still so packed! Food came out pretty fast and we ended up bringing our food to Bryant Park which is about a 5-10 minute walk from Urbanspace Vanderbilt. There are so many different restaurants and cuisines to try here and I can't wait to come back again someday! There are also small but clean bathrooms as well.\n\nThis is one of the larger and trendier food halls in NYC so definitely check it out! Other notable mentions are Chelsea Market Hudson Eats City Kitchen Gotham West Market and Broadway Bites." u"Came here with coworkers after work earlier this week and really loves the vibe and variety of food and beer choices! \n\nThere is seating and there were a couple tables open but I'm sure during lunch time or prime time dinner hour it's probably pretty packed and difficult to get a seat inside. \n\nPro tip: make sure you take a look everywhere before you get food!!! I passed on dinner and just grabbed cheese fries but after I ordered I walked around and saw a bunch of other yummy food choices too! \n\nI'll be back!!!" u"Impressive diverse food court inside of a rustic warehouse type of building.  I went here at about 1:30 pm.  It was very chaotic loud tons of people.  I can't imagine going here on your work lunch hour.  You would spend so much time waiting to place an order and waiting to find a place to sit and eat let alone getting back to work on time.  However it felt like happy hour for the lunch hour.  It's a very social mingling type of place yuppies on their lunch break.  Don't get me wrong I very much enjoyed it and was impressed because it was so trendy.  I just couldn't imagine going here under normal lunch time restraints.\n\nI ordered a double-burger from one of the food stalls.  Devoured that and ordered a few donuts to go.  Luckily I met a friend here and we weren't in a terrible rush so it was cool.  The food was delish.  I would return if I am on that side of town again." u'Pros: \n\nTon of stalls bundled in a cozy rustic hall : Ramen pizza burger tacos donuts wine bar etc. Food is decent and I love having variety. The pizza & chicken burger were tasty. \n\nCons: \n\nVery crowded & long queues  so quick lunches are  impossible. More than that the seating is haphazard and very close knitted ; think of park benches and 5 people on. And a bottled water costs $2 this ridiculous price tag applies to other food items here too.\n\nSadly owing to very limited choices of lunch spot around grand central I will be back when my day is not crazy busy.'],-0.0083,0.117,0.766,0.118
11.Tony’s Di Napoli,[u"This place is just a gem! Every time we come to NYC it's always our first dinner stop and we have left overs for the rest of our trip. Dirty Martinis are spot on! For a family of three the chicken parmigiana and side order of the pasta (can't remember the name of the sauce but it had mushrooms in it) per our servers recommendation and it was absolutely delicious. And we got the app of the breaded clams we were totally stuffed. Can't wait to go back and save some room for desert. \n\nFYI the food is served in family style portions the house salad fed us three while dining in plus leftovers as well!" u'Whenever I go to New York Tony\'s is ALWAYS on my to do list!  I never miss an opportunity to dine here it\'s synonymous with New York!  I\'ve been to both locations and they are equally amazing!  \n\nI know it sounds trite to say "This is my favorite Italian restaurant" but it really is!! The best on the planet!  Sure it\'s noisy and busy-it\'s Italian!! I love the hustle and bustle the servers are flawless!  I have a couple of fav servers Vasilese is terrific!  If you are looking for a quiet romantic night you may want to come on a weeknight.  The weekends are packed with enthusiastic foodies and this place is hopping lively and fun! \n\nThe family style portions are humongous!  The prices are worth every morsel!! We ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the chicken Marsala along with our salads and I\'m just saying party in my mouth!  My taste buds were doing a happy dance! I savored every bite!  The chicken was tender and the sauce was smooth and velvety!  The pasta was cooked to perfection al dente and the sauce was incredible consistency was just right!  But we saved room for dessert and had you guessed it the New York cheesecake!  We had wine with our meal and coffee with dessert...  perfect combos!  There\'s such an eclectic clientele here too!  It\'s an exciting venue!\n\nI really can\'t say enough great things about Tony\'s and I\'ll never tire of this top notch restaurant!!' u"I literally can't say enough good things. We came in starving 20 minutes before close and the manager seated us instantly. Wouldn't hear of us ordering to go. My son and I have celiac disease and they not only told me it wasn't a problem but fed us one of the better meals I've ever had. And when the manager overheard it was my birthday he insisted he bring us a dessert (on the house) and if I didn't like anything they had on hand he'd order something in. \n\nWe came back days later and in a sea of people he recognized us and sat us straight away. We've already told everyone about this place. This is definitely no tourist trap. It's truly amazing food with an equally amazing staff. Every single person we've encountered in this restaurant was welcoming accommodating and incredibly kind. I can't wait to come back." u"I have been to both Tony;s both this location and the location on the upper east side and I can say that although the food is basically the same this location I think is better.\n\nI always go with classics here as that is what they do best. The menu is family style and the portions come in half or full. The prices are very reasonable especially for the quality. \n\nThe calamari here is second to none very large portion with mainly the rings. Also try the shrimp francese its great. \n\nThe food here is great but as I said in my review of the other location it's extremely simple so stick with what they recommend. Although I gave the other location 3 stars I'm giving this location 4." u"It's an old school Times Square fixture that offers Americanized family style Italian food. The location is huge so it works for big groups. The restaurant caters to a lot of tourist as well as the theater crowd.\n\nThe food:\n\nStuffed Mushrooms- The stuffed mushrooms were just OK I felt they were on the bland side the mushroom themselves should have been cooked down more and the filling came out too soft and mushy. Overall I would get something else. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UI69JwZM8SYUCkFK2yAJ8g&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nRigatoni Ala Vodka Sauce with Mushrooms- The dish was the highlight of the meal. The rigatoni was cooked nicely with a little bit of a give the sauce had good flavor and it was not over sauced or too greasy. I would recommend this. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a3BHzcpQkNjTyXl9cO_cgg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nChicken Francese- This is usually an autogood for me but the one here was pretty lackluster. The chicken breast was kinda boring and overcooked the sauce didn't have a pronounced flavor and they also put too much lemon. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KBPxJBH5nR1j-CGDHzmeuw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA" u'A nice family style dining. We had one of our friends bday dinner here and it was really nice. We were seated downstairs which gave us a more private and cozy kind of atmosphere. \nThe food were great and we love the sangria- good for non alcoholic guests. We had the strawberry ale too as her bday cake.' u'This was our one "fancy restaurant" experience where we actually dressed up and made reservations for dinner. It\'s in the touristy area so not everyone dresses up but you should at least do jeans and a collar.   We were seated right away when we showed up and our waiter took our drink order.  I ordered a Manhattan because well that\'s where I was.  The waiter then warned us that the food was served family style so my daughter\'s and I should order only 1 pasta and 1 entr\xe9e to split.  Of course we couldn\'t come to a consensus so we got 3 entrees. Uggh.  Teenagers.\n\nDaughter one ordered the Salmon Oreganata which was like 3 salmon filets cooked in a white wine sauce.  She said it was delicious and it was 38.00.  It seems high for an entree but she did get 3 big ass pieces of salmon.\n\nDaughter 2 and I decided to get an entr\xe9e and a pasta.  We ordered the steak pizzaiola which was cooked to order sirloin (I\'m guessing the cut and of course medium rare) in a  tomato sauce with red bell peppers and shrooms.  I had never heard of this dish before but couldn\'t believe how great it was!  The amount of beef in this 40.00 dish was incredible.  We also got the Linguine with broccoli (26.00) and its a pasta dish cooked with olive oil butter garlic and broccoli.  This was simple yet delicious.  It seems expensive on a per entr\xe9e basis but we also ate dinner the next night and it was still good as luke warm leftovers.  With the amount of food you get the place is actually a bargain.  \n\nI would totally eat here again and will now be looking for steak pizzaiola whenever I\'m in an Italian restaurant.' u"We arrived pre theatre pre rush and were greeted amiably and seated straightaway in a cozy booth. There was plenty of open seating so we did have a choice seat. I'd say as an outsider only reading online reviews that the ambiance is cozy and inviting and you can have good conversation here with the carpeted flooring. It's a nice break from the move of the City just steps off Times Square.\n\nThe walls are lined with portraits of the celebs who have visited Tony's clearly indicating we have made a wise choice in stopping by.\n\nService was pleasant and paced quickly and portions were enormous as has been mentioned by everyone (including the server). We were pleased with the food taste overall though the marinara is a little sweet. We ordered cocktails calamari chicken parm and baked ziti. The bread was delicious and I had to stop myself from eating too much of it. \n\nThe bar was also busy when we walked In - 4pm on a Friday - so if one wanted only a beverage I could see stopping here for that. \n\nThere are plenty of overpriced places near Times Square this stays true to Midtown. When we left at 5:30 every table was full and there was a line out the door. We know why." u"I wandered in on a rainy night and sat at the bar.  I was quickly greeted poured a cocktail and handed a menu.  Nice menu of all the normal Italian favorites not too big so you get confused and can't make a decision.  My only complaint is rigatoni and meat sauce shouldn't cost as much as it does but hey they're near Times Square and have to pay their rent.  The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be and the meat sauce was not sweet and loaded with meat. \nThere are TVs at the bar which are typically tuned to local sports.  The bread which I think is awesome is covered in sesame seeds and served with butter.  They have a pretty good wine list but not a lot by the glass.  I would say if you need to take a group out you'd want to come here as they serve family style.  It was just what I wanted on a rainy night and I'll be back!" u"Overall rating\nAtmosphere/cleanliness - 5\nService - 5\nMenu options - 4\nFood - 5\nPrice - 5\nTotal - 24/5 = 4.8\n\nAmazing food and always full of guests. Great for groups/family style meal. Just make reservations ahead.\n\nEverything is great about them environment is amazing it's always lively all the servers are Italians and patient in explaining the menu and make recommendations food is amazing its cheap the only thing about this Italian restaurant is that they do t serve pizza. But everything else is enough for me to go back many times my personal favorite is the eggplant parmigiana." u"I was visiting NY and was craving a nice Italian meal before I headed back to LA. \n\nAs soon as my party and I got seated I let our server know we were on a time crunch due to having to be at the airport soon. Tony made sure our food arrived quickly and that everything went smoothly.\n\nWe ordered the eggplant Parmesan the Italian salad and Penne alla vodka pasta.. they have family portions.. which are huge! We were 3 adults and we had plenty of food leftover. \n\nThe food is delicious filling and definitely comforting. Will have to go back the next time I'm in NY. \n\nGreat restaurant for big parties. :)" u'Food: Ordered the chicken parm and bolognese. Chicken was well cooked crunchy well flavored with additional tomato sauce.  The bolognese was honestly a bit bland nothing truly special.  Portions are enormous family style my gf and I could have definitely been okay sharing just one dish. \n\nService: Overall an incredibly busy restaurant touristy spot but the waiters were very attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes. \n\nDecor: Inside is large but has a small town feel.' u'Came here with associates that recommended it.  Great Italian place with great service.  Everything was served family style.  We started with the house salad and grilled shrimp & calamari which was different than other calamari but very good.  Also had the rigatoni with mushroom ina vodka sauce which was excellent rich and sooo good.  Also had the veal parm which was deliciously cheesy with a tasty tangy tomato sauce.  We really enjoyed the meal and left so stuffed and satisfied.' u'The food was outstanding! The only complaint I have is that we had a reservation at 530 confirmed the reservation the day before and they still made us wait for a table for about 10 min. Not a big deal but plan ahead to wait if you have to see a show afterwards.' u"Highly recommend! Carmine's has nothing on Tony's! \n\nThe plan was to go to Carmine's (Times Square location) to grab dinner but it was super crowded. We barely made it past the door without being shoved. Even at 8:30 PM on a Sunday we would have to wait 45+ minutes for just a table of 3! Hahaha no thank you! After debating between a few other options that showed up on Yelp we decided to go with Tony's; so grateful that we did! \n\nTony's Di Napoli was much quieter than Carmine's which was great because my friends and I didn't have to shout over each other to have a conversation. We also did not have to wait unreasonably long for a table just saying. \n\nOur waitress was very helpful and accommodating; she checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything was fine. She gave us a few suggestions and shared some insight on some of the popular dishes. We ended up getting the fried calamari (Calamari Fritti) Rigatoni Bolognese and Tony's Chicken (recommended by our waitress). \n\nThe fried calamari's outer layer wasn't as crispy as I had anticipated but it was very good nonetheless especially when dipped in the marinara sauce which had a great tomato taste with a hint of sweetness. The Rigatoni Bolognese was okay; I like my pastas to be on the saucier side. Tony's chicken was my favorite dish of the night. I didn't know the dish came with arugula which I'm not a big fan of. However the arugula worked well in this dish and didn't overpower the flavors of the tomatoes and onions. \n\nWe couldn't finish the two entr\xe9es and each of us took a box of leftovers home for Monday's lunch.\n\nI'll be back for sure!" u'Came here for the first time before going to see a Broadway show. We had a very large group of about 20 people and the staff was very accommodating! Nothing but professional and polite employees! The food was delicious too might I add! Family style huge portions of Italian goodness :-) We ended up splitting a few orders of the chicken francese penne a la vodka meatballs and a salad with pears for the appetizers. Everything was great! They knew we had to make a show too after the dinner so they were very prompt in making sure our food came out fast. No complaints at all about this place! Definitely make a stop in!' u'This family style restaurant definitely serve some deliciously authentic Italian food. Considering that they are in the tourist dominated Times Square area I was expecting bland small portions and over priced dishes. But I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nMake reservations when you come here because it will be very packed and you will have to wait a while. They have family style portions for very reasonable prices. Our server was very funny and entertaining. Unlike most servers who just come to take our order ask if we need anything else and then disappear he stopped by once in a while to just talk to us about some of his interesting stories about other customers he waited on. We had a great time here.\n\nThe only thing we didn\'t like was that we sat at a really big round table and had to shout over the voices of other customers to talk to one another. In the end we didn\'t really socialize much and just ate in silence because we were tired of shouting and saying "What?!" across the table.' u'7 of us came tonight for dinner after seeing a broadway play. I had made reservations about a month ago and they sat us right away when we arrived. Our server was patty and she was great! For apps we ordered the fried mozzarella and the burrAta. Both were delicious. For dinner we had the ceaser salad the rigatoni alavodka the eggplant and veal dish the chicken Frances and the shrimp scampi. The shrimp was a little tough but everything else was delicious and was just the right amount of food for the 7 of us. We also had a delicious bottle of red wine and for dessert we had the taramisu and the Italian cheesecake. Both were delicious. We really enjoyed our meal and we would def go back!' u'I knew what I was getting into - loud and touristy. \n\nThe food was okay nothing to write home about.' u"Ugh I should have known better than to eat in touristy Times Square. BUT this place had great reviews so I had to try it. It was a step below Bucca Di Beppol which to the average American hitting up tourist spots would be great. To a normal person with taste buds this was frozen garbage mass produced and reheated to feed the masses.\n\nIt's family style which means you order something to share with the table. \n\nMy friend and I started at the bar and were just going to eat there but our table cam available prior to ordering food. We knew what we wanted to order and were pleased to see that they had individual portions as an option so we didn't have to agree on one thing and share. We chased out our drinks and went to the table. \n\nWe get to our table and the waiter is a jerk. Stereotypical frat boy who gave zero turds about anyone other than himself. He did not want to be there he did not want to answer any questions and he was super rude and dismissive in his responses. The only thing that seemed to bring him any joy was when he told us the individual menu was only available at the bar not in the dining room.\n\n- Had we known we had to order family style in the main dining room we would have stayed at the bar - \n\nWe ordered two dishes a check entree and an eggplant one. They. Were. Terrible. Steuffer's frozen entrees taste better than the slop we were served. Actually they could have been one in the same as what we were given was 110% frozen previously and just reheated and served to us. We ate it because we were starving and paying a lot for it but we were barely able to choke it down. \n\nWe would have told our server but he never came back. We had to flag another person down to ask for more water and yet another for our bill.\n\nAwful food awful service I would never ever ever go back. They ONLY survive because they are in Times Square."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
78.Hourglass Tavern,[u"One of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nIt's rare that you go to a restaurant where the service is fast and friendly the ambience perfect the food and beverage is of great quality and all at a VERY reasonable price. \n\nMy girlfriend got the steak I got a blackened tuna steak... And we both spent the majority of the evening arguing which meal was better. The appetizer was a chicken and sun-dried tomato meatball that was outstanding. Washing it all down with a bourbon sour (made with larceny an underrated choice) was just icing on the cake. \n\nAs if this wasn't enough the location was off of a quiet (but Manhattan standards) side street with outdoor seating. Our server Maria really set the stage for a familial experience and it felt like we were invited over her house for dinner... Minus the constant hovering.\n\nI'd recommend hourglass tavern a thousand times over and can't wait to come back again." u"I loved this place when I first went a few years ago. Last night I brought my family there for dinner and it was sort of disappointing. First though the waitress was very nice and was really great about changing my dish. \n\nA few of the things we ordered:\n\nspinach -- too expensive for the amount given. It tasted good though. \n\nlamb shank special (pre-fixe menu with salad and dessert) -- delicious but not $40 delicious. \n\nwhite wine mussel -- the wine was WAY TOO STRONG. The waitress was nice enough to change it for their marinara one and that tasted pretty good. A bit heavy on the garlic and lacked a little bit but a heck of a lot better than the white wine. It's unfortunate too because the white wine sauce would've tasted really good if it wasn't for the overpowering alcohol taste. \n\nlobster ravioli -- pretty good!\n\ntiramisu -- EH. Dry and lack the coffee taste." u"Been here twice once for brunch and once for a happy hour. Both times we sat on the second floor a.k.a the 'Bettibar'. This level is cozy and nicely decorated with a handful of tables and some seating by the bar. \n\nPart 1 - Brunch. It was fairly quiet when we came at about 1:30 pm on a Saturday. They gave us some nice little muffins to start and we ordered a beer and the Sangria which was alright but nothing special. They were out of the shrimp and grits (noo! the one thing we came here for!) but the food we ordered was quite good. The steak and eggs were solid and the crab cake Benedict was well seasoned and flavorful.\n\nPart 2 - Happy hour. Seeing a sign advertising their amazing happy hour during our brunch here we decided to give it a try. The happy hour is limited to the second floor only but is quite generous as it goes on till 10 pm. Good selection of beer and wine available for the happy hour. We also tried the mystery beer + shot deal which was quite good. The beer was an Ommegang seasonal brew and the shot was something fruity but potent. We also got a couple rounds of sliders to munch on. The beef ones were quite good as were the Cuban sliders. They were out of anything puff pastry based (I'm starting to think we have some terrible luck here).\n\nService was friendly and attentive both times and the space is warm and inviting. A hidden gem in this area for sure." u"Just had drinks here but it was really cool. Three stories with great ambiance and great drinks. Loved the mystery beer and shot for $9. Bartender was really friendly as well. Great selection and great prices!\n\nSaw other people's food and it looked amazing. Would definitely come back to eat." u"This place is a gem. My friend and I were craving Italian after playing some sand volleyball and this place popped up on my yelp that was open relatively late. \n\nThe place is small and quaint and has indoor upstairs and outside seating. We decided to sit outside and we were given the nicest waitress. It's so refreshing having an enthusiastic and genuinely caring waitress. \n\nWe ordered the fettuccine alfredo with blackened chicken and that was really good. I have never had blackened chicken but this gave it such a great flavor that I haven't tasted before. \n\nWe ordered another dish as well it was a penne pasta with a creamy tomato I believe. I don't remember the name but it had sausage as the protein. THIS DISH WAS AMAZING. It had so much flavor.\n\nWe gobbled up both dishes and will definitely be back!" u"This is one of my favorite spots in midtown. First they have an excellent happy hour: $5 for wine beer well drinks and sangria (the best sangria!)\nSecond it's not too large of a space and a bizarre space (old NY charm). The size can be annoying because it fills up quickly but if you have a seat you're not swallowed in sound. It's perfect for a date night. The food is excellent! Fresh ingredients prepared daily and just tasty. My favorites (both veggie options) are the mushroom ravioli and the zucchini sandwich. \n\nHands down a great little hole in the wall." u'This restaurant is close to most of the Broadway theaters and has a prix fixe as well as a regular menu. It offers outdoor seating and has three levels. The eating area rooms are small and a little loud. I got the prix fixe meal which came with soup or salad bread and dessert. The mixed green salad was fresh and was served with a very light Italian dressing. My chicken was cooked and seasoned just right. Other members of our party got a pasta dish. They enjoyed the light sauce and the spices were very tasty. Even though the place was very busy our server did a good job of meeting all our needs. They have a full bar as well as wine and beer. If you are looking for a good meal that is reasonably priced then the Hourglass will fit the bill.' u"I was at Betty Bar for a party. The happy hour deal was great and it's till close which is nice. The drinks weren't though. They were very dilute water down cocktails and the place only has three - four tables I think so it gets very crowded. The music wasn't so great and I wasn't impressed." u'I LOVE this place!  We couldn\'t decide where to go on restaurant row and we asked some locals who all suggested this place. As we walked in people shook their heads and smiled like "you found the spot".\n\nWe had the BEST experience tonight! Ra is amazing! He melted our butter in our roll....He\'s so into service and so attentive!  We checked in to the top floor and found a comfy spot. There are 3 floors to chiise from.The top two offered bars. It\'s super small but super cozy.\n\nThe portion size is massive so be ready for a full belly. The menu includes options for several pre fixes - I had the tilapi and it was great.' u"Great food and the coziest atmosphere ever. The kind of place that not a lot of people know about  it those who do are loyal for all the best reasons. \n\nBeth and Josh are the owners and they are not only great people but they've taken an old historic restaurant site and breathed new yet still charming life into it!!!" u"Great price + hella on-point food = Bruh. Come. \n\nI came here with 2 friends and this place is THE BOMB DOT COM. It's pretty cheap for what you get. 10/10 recommend. Like $16 for a crabcake benedict near Times Square? Dude. That's unheard of. I had to look twice. Also $5 for cocktails? It wasn't some watered-down bullshit scam of a drink. It was a real high-quality drink like you would get at a bar. The crabcake benedict wasn't the best thing I've ever had but again for the price it's worth it. This place is actually really small in size and a hole in the wall. But definitely worth a bite. You have nothing to lose. Will be back!" u"Let me start off by saying that had the Hourglass not been highly recommended we probably would not have chosen to eat here after the theatre. As we walked down the street there were many establishments that looked much nicer. Add in the fact that I checked out the reviews on Yelp and I was a little concerned ...\n\nThat said we thoroughly enjoyed our meals and would definitely return. \n\nWe had a reservation and were seated immediately - seating is tight but adequate. Our server was good and somehow managed to keep up with all her tables. To say this place is small is an understatement! The young man carrying dishes up the stairs to the bar could probably easily run a marathon.\n\nBeer and wine selection is limited but they will order a specific wine for you - or charge a corking fee if you bring your own. We started with Taverna salads for two a Roasted Beet Salad and the Vegetable Soup. While the salads were good my soup was bland and tasteless - plenty of vegetables but no taste at all.\n\nEntrees consisted of the Grilled Pork Chop (actually ordered the chicken) Mushroom Ravioli and two orders of the Bourbon Short Ribs. Everything was excellent - the meat fell off the bones and my wife loved her ravioli. The homemade bread was excellent!\n\nHow they manage to turn out all of this food in a timely manner is an amazing feat! I was seated so that I could watch the activity in an open kitchen that could not have been 8' x 10'. When we were leaving I spoke with the owner (also manager and busboy according to him) about the amazing performance in the kitchen. We will definitely return in the future and try for the 2nd or 3rd floor." u"This review is also for Betti Bar upstairs not Hourglass downstairs.  Maybe we should make a page just for the bar?  \n\nAnyway kindof stumbled in here one day with Sonia G. after a YEE at Havana Central.  We weren't feeling the pig on a spit so we were walking home drunk and super hungry.  Looking for a place with a late happy hour (because of course you keep drinking) we ended up here.\n\nThe bar is cozy and quaint; you feel like you're in a friend's apartment and your friend is the bartender.  \n\nTo eat had the Shrimp Positano and the chicken club - they were okay.  Come here for the drinks.  :)" u'Bettibar\'s happy hour is from 5-10PM! It\'s located on the second floor of Hourglass Tavern (the staircase is on the right side and can be accessed inside Hourglass Tavern or outside between Hourglass Tavern and La Pulperia).\n\nThis place is the perfect place for a nightcap after all of the other happy hours in the area end around 7-8. They have an extensive HH menu house wines for $5 mixed drinks beers and mystery beer and shot - all between the range of $5-10.\n\nBettibar is committed to their "hourglass" theme and has several hourglasses decorated around the bar. It has an old-timey feel and the bar is a triangle shape. The venue is small but I\'ve never had a problem snagging a table when I\'ve dropped by around 9PM. I came here last St. Patrick\'s Day and it surprisingly was not busy at all.\n\nI have yet to try their food menu since I come so late but it looks like your standard bar menu for relatively low prices.' u'This restaurant is quite small is the only downfall. Other than that though it was pretty amazing.\n\nOur waiter was super friendly and joined in on our jokes.\n\nThe drinks we got were absolutely delicious. For my dinner I ordered the short ribs which were amazing and fell right off the bone. \n\nDefinitely highly recommended!' u"Found this place after a quick search for brunch spots in the Theater district. It has fours stars and nearly 500 reviews so figured it must be good! \n\nWell turns out those reviews must be for dinner/bar because they just started serving brunch not to long before we went (back in March '16). And well they still have some kinks to work out at the time. \n\nWe made reservations for 11:30am (which is the time they open of Sundays) and when we arrived it was clear they we not ready for us or the other customers who also were arriving for 11:30am reservations. \n\nWe were taken to the third floor and sat at a table right next to the waiter prep area. Since I assume the kitchen is on the first floor this area is used as a bar/coffee prep area by the waiters. Several times during the meal all we good hear was the head waitress (for lack of better name) explaining to the other waiters what to do. Not very pleasant. \n\nI ordered a mimosa and coffee to drink. I later discovered (I overhead the waiters taking) that they had flavored coffee. For my second coffee I asked for that since was never offered it. \n\nTo start they brought out two mini muffins which would of been nice if mine wasn't burnt. \n\nFor my meal I got the Oven Baked Potato Pancakes and cheese grits. The potato pancakes were good and came topped with smoked salmon. But the cheese girts we not edible. The cheese was hard as could be on top. I sent them back and had to ask for them to be taken off the bill. My fiance got the Seasonal Belgian Waffles which we would of thought the strawberries would of been in the waffles instead of simply on top. But they were still tasty. \n\nAll in all not sure I would go back again for brunch. The services was slow and the food wasn't all that good." u'This establishment was wonderful. The owner took time to talk with us about the history of this amazing building. The service was quick quick quick. Wonderful staff and environment.' u"One of the few restaurants opened on New Years Day in the area which I appreciate. 4 of us went for brunch. It wasn't too crowded but had half the tables filled. I ordered the potato pancake which I thought was delicious. Others have the crabcake Benedict and the chicken sandwich. I heard they were decent. \nThe restaurant occupies all the floors of the townhouse which is an interesting set up but it also means each floor was quite small since they have a bar on each floor. I personally prefer a more open space." u'Brunch was delish!  The waffle and bacon was really good and i had the egg and rib hash which was really good.\n\nThis place is super cute and worthy of a first date!  A must do!' u'Great breakfast - you start with wonderful blueberry muffins that were so great. The blueberry waffle was fantastic with the blueberries actually baked in. We did the $15 unlimited mimosas great idea. \n\nOur waitress was so funny and sweet she really made the whole experience an absolute pleasure!'],0.8072,0.343,0.657,0.0
86.Rustic Table,[u'Arrived to NYC with my 16 year old daughter and a friend for a long weekend from sunny California. We found this place over Yelp which was a 15 minute walk from our hotel. It was a freezing morning but this place is worth it!!! \nThe vibe music service and food were excellent. Had the Smashed Avocado sandwich with the sunny side up egg. This was superb! Came with a small side salad a really interesting dip (Silan and Tahine). My daughter had the Saksukah and my friend the farmers breakfast. For drinks we had a cappuccino  hot Nutella and for desert each one has the chocolate rogalech. The food was AMAZING. But moreover we loved sitting on the bar watching the open kitchen and listening to the music.\nWe loved the place so much that we came back on our last day.\nHighly recommended this place.' u"The vibe is really cool and I enjoyed the decor... \n\nHowever the food was just OK and the service was non existent from the server. The person I was with didn't enjoy their food and the server (she may have been new) dropped the check off without checking to see if we needed anything else enjoying the choices we selected or even a to go box...\n\nMany other options out there which sucks because this is right by my house... Maybe it's more of a quick drink at the bar or quick coffee place?" u"Stopped here for a quick breakfast Sunday morning and was super pleased with everything. It's definitely a small place to eat but in a cozy kind of way. We ordered The Veggie Early Lunch and Farmer's Breakfast and they were all so delicious. The Hot Nutella is amazing! I only wish it came in a bigger size. \n\nService was great our waitress was lovely and any staff member we interacted with was friendly. This is certainly a place I will visit again." u"The good: We came around 1pm on a Saturday for brunch. The house was packed but the 2 of us were seated immediately -- nice! Waitress was sweet and attentive. After experiencing so much rude/poor service in NY I was beginning to think I was crazy for ever expecting anything else. But service here rocks! Also great coffee and it comes with 1 refill.\n\nThe less good: The space is compact and popular so noise levels are through the roof. I could hardly hear my friend from across the tiny table. Friend commented that everything is smaller here... tables chairs and portions. We got the mushroom farmer's breakfast and the avocado smash sandwich. Both were small and accompanied by a tiny 10-leaf salad. Neither of us are particularly big eaters but for the price I was far from satisfied. The bread here is truly rustic very chewy with a thick crust. It was too much for the avocado sandwich the inside of which had good flavor but as a whole was like 90% bread 10% avocado/mushroom which is not my idea of an amazing sandwich.\n\nOverall cute place for a light meal but if you've got a decent appetite or want to have a conversation without shouting maybe look elsewhere." u'Went for brunch on a Sunday morning as a group of three.  The guy in the front handling the wait list seemed overwhelmed/annoyed and was a bit rude to the patrons trying to inquire about wait times. \n\nThe ambiance was cute but the food was only okay and a bit underwhelming.  There are also very few seats available - I would only recommend coming as parties of one or two.' u"Ever since my 'Sesame Date Smoothie' encounter at Rustic Table I was hooked. It was creamy date-sweet thick without being chunky and full of flavor. A simple but brilliant treat. The 'Mint Lemonade' was more lemonade than mint lemonade; the mint was practically absent aside from the few leaves for garnish.\n\n'Early Lunch' seemed to be their most popular pick for lunchtime. I imagined the angus beef to be effortless and easy to pull apart with a fork but it was a bit tough for slow-cooked standards. The 'Shakshuka' fared a bit better though a tad too watery for my personal preference. To date I still find Jack's Wife Freida serves the best shakshuka (in NYC).\n\nOverall great ambience and vibes from Rustic Table. Getting seats here was relatively easy considering the small dining area but it does get packed once lunch starts to pick up. Food was more of a 3/5 but the date smoothie was SO good I'm bumping this place up to a 4." u"A very cute place but the food wasn't that good. I came here on a Saturday morning and there was a wait - 15-20 minutes for 4 of us. They don't take reservations. Given the high average star rating I thought OK this could be good.\n\nWe were seated at the counter which was fine since there is not a lot of seating but hard for 4 of us to really chit chat in a loud environment. The service was good. I ordered the Farmer's Breakfast - omelette with mushrooms mozzarella and a side of greens. Overall it was OK but not hearty therefore it would not be eaten by any farmer. I don't think it's worth the price we paid for brunch." u"My wife and I had just got off a water taxi from NJ and were looking for something close. Rustic Table looked very interesting. We had about a 15 minute wait so we wandered around the area. We were seated immediately when we got back perfect timing. This is a small cozy place. Everyone we talked with loved their food as did we. We started with mimosas and coffee a perfect way to start our Saturday in Manhattan! I had the Fisherman's Breakfast with an avocado plate and my wife had the Quiche. We loved our food. Such a cool place! Give it a try and don't worry if there is a wait it's worth it!" u'Rustic Table is a cute little breakast/coffee shop in Hell\'s Kitchen which really lives up to its name. The wooden coffee bar seating and tables along with the eye-catching light fixtures really give it that "rustic" and industrial aesthetic best enjoyed with a fresh cup of coffee. \n\nComing into Rustic Table on a Sunday morning around 9am wasn\'t too bad. The place is small but I\'ve seen it form a line in the later morning on the weekends. There\'s bar seating for around 8-10 along with a few tables but overall it\'s a pretty small establishment. \n\nFood: \nSalmon Farmer\'s Omelette (with a side of bread fresh olive butter and arugula salad) - I love love love smoked salmon so this really hit the spot for me. The omelette was cooked perfectly on the outside and a little runny on the inside but not raw. I am so sad whenever I get an overcooked omelette or a raw one but I can say this one was just on the dot with how well it was done. The smoked salmon was fresh and what really surprised me was the amazing homemade olive butter that I spread upon my side of bread and enjoyed thoroughly. Everything here seems super fresh and they really focus on the quality of each item and dish. \n\nShakshuka - I only tried a bite of my friend\'s dish but it was a beautiful display with the perfectly cooked over easy eggs atop of an array of tomato chunks and sauce. The flavor of the tomatoes and sauce was so fresh tasting the combination of the tomatoes and eggs was perfect and complimentary.\n\nCoffee: \n- Don\'t remember where their coffee is from but it was just okay to be honest\n\nOverall pretty solid breakfast place great atmosphere and quality dishes/ingredients I would definitely be down to come again next time I come round to NY.' u"Cute and literally rustic (as named) establishment in midtown west area. It is a pretty small cafe with not that much seating. They have a variety of coffee and espresso drinks including matcha latte. They have non dairy options like soy and almond milk. There are also some house baked pastries and occasionally I see a vegan blueberry muffin but not all the time. \n\nI've also eaten there once before. Simple menu of pretty fresh food such as salads avocado toast. Avocado toast was yummy!! Friendly staff. Prices are normal New York prices (not cheap per se). \n\nOverall cute place for a simple/ light meal and a cuppa coffee or tea." u'This place is such a cute and great place for brunch with friends or a date. Came here after work for breakfast with coworkers. The environment is very friendly and has the great rustic feel all around. \n\nStaff is very friendly. Dawn our waitress was super nice gave great recommendations and was on top of everything with serving us. Another staff Edad (sorry if i misspelled) was also super friendly. A coworker needed to charge her phone and he was nice enough to look for an outlet. \n\nI ordered the shashuka (as recommended by Dawn) which comes with a salad. Shashuka was delicious and goes well with the bread they provide. Ask for the salad dressing which goes so well with salad. I also order the matcha latte which was good but it is not sweeten for all the matcha lovers. \n\nDefinitely would recommend this place and would come back in the future.' u"If you're looking for a good spot in Midtown check this out. We had a great breakfast and one the the best cappuccinos I've ever had. From the minute we stepped in they were very accommodating and sat us at the bar and got our order started while waiting for a table. \nSmall and cozy. Our server Dawn lives up to her name-bright and cheery. \nNext time we're in city we'll go back." u'- Outstanding service \n- great vibe \n- fusion \n- loved the setup\n- I will def come back here' u"I wanted to like this place and had high hopes due to its high ratings but I did not like what I ordered. I had the Farmer's Breakfast which consisted of a roasted mushroom and mozzarella omelet with a side salad. The omelet itself was very pleasing to the eye since it was perfectly shaped (see picture) but the egg was overcooked and spongey. It tasted as if they used packaged eggs and not fresh eggs. The mushrooms and mozzarella did not add much flavor to the omelet which left the omelet very bland. The place is also very small and seating is very limited. I might have to come try their other items on the menu but the omelet was sad spongey and flavorless." u"Rustic Table sits on the south side of 42nd Street near the intersection with 10th Avenue. I did not expect to find an excellent place for lunch after a visit to the China Consulate down the street. Yet though small in stature this urban cottage offers charm curiosity great service and creative plates from a barstool along the thick wood plank bar where most customers sit for in house dining. \n\nThe vibe is post-industrial with old factory parts hanging from iron rails above and antiques on walls and even used for holding napkins on the lunch bar. The open kitchen allows a view of the beehive activity of the chef and his assistants as well as the serving staff that although buzzing have time for a friendly word and helping hand. The menu is breakfast brunch and lunch ideas that are named as creatively as the actual plated beauties. We ordered the Balkan Croissant ( roasted veggie omelet arugula and harissa tahini sauce ) on fresh crescent roll and Cauliflower Sweet Potato Sandwich ( cauli sweet po. feta arugula tahini with mint aioli spread on French baguette ).  We drank the New York soft tap water with lemon. \n\nThe Balkan was served on a wood plank with a small arugula salad on the side. It was delicious. The ingredients were fresh with just enough spice mixed in and quality croissant to make the texture and taste compete for dominance. Excellent. The sandwich came on a rectangular white ceramic plate and was very enjoyable with the same side salad.  The bread was crunchy and fun to chew as it slowly released its grainy flavors and subtly swirled with the contents within.  Due to the size and shape of the veggies there was a fair amount of fallout each time the sandwich was elevated and tilted to bite.  That's what the fork and our fingers were for.  There was also a small dish of a sweet sauce that reminded of a honey base. I just don't remember what our excellent server said it was. I dipped the corners of my sandwich in it with almost every bite.  Unusual but eye opening. \n\nRustic Table is not a place you want to rush from despite the somewhat cramped conditions. Better to sit and enjoy the repast and conversation and then have a cup of coffee and brownie to extend the stay.  \n\nKudos to the mad Balkan who created this interesting and tasty place." u"A friend who knew I was in New York for the week told me to check out Rustic Table.  I went there last Sunday and the place was packed with a line of people waiting for the table.  Short on time I remembered my friend said the croissants were amazing so I ordered the peanut butter banana Nutella version with an iced coffee to go.  I was not disappointed.  If you find yourself the 15th person on the list but want something while you wait or for the road definitely grab a croissant to go. By the way the gentleman taking names and managing the waitlist could not have been nicer. Ditto fro the young man at the counter who got my order ready.  I can't wait to go back on an off time and try more of what they have." u"Came here on a Saturday morning with a group of four around 11am and was seated at the bar. It was a little loud so it was hard to talk but unfortunately since it's such a small space we had to take what we could get. We asked if we might be able to get a table instead but the host said that they couldn't do that for us which is understandable.\n\nI didn't get a great look but there was 4 bar seats one long table seating probably 8? And maybe another two 2-people tables. \n\nI ordered the shredded chicken which among our four orders was probably one of the most filling meals. I tend not to eat a lot but this was just enough to get me a little more than full. It came with a side of arugula that tasted very fresh and a salad dressing of some sort. The chicken was really well flavored and they didn't skimp out which was nice. It's definitely pretty oily since it was dripping out the bread and down my hand. \n\nOne of my friends who was probably the biggest eater got the omelette and it was a little pathetic how small and simple it was especially for the cost. I do understand that this is midtown but check photos to make sure you want to order it. On the plus side it did come with unlimited bread. \n\nI have to admit that the chicken sandwich was delicious but this is definitely on the pricier end. I give it three stars because it is good but I believe there are better options out there. If I had to pick a brunch place to take a friend I wouldn't choose here." u'Cozy.  Excellent service and the food is amazing!! What a find.  We had the peanut chicken salad the rustic table salad and smoked salmon on the side.  \n\nMy chicken salad was flavorful visually pleasant and I ugly ate the entire thing.  Sweet potatoes in that dish really sets it perfectly. \n\nThe olive oil butter slab with the bread slices is delicious.  If I lived here it would be a favorite frequent stop.' u'Ate breakfast here last week - my husband and I shared The Veggie Shakshuka and a side of avocado along with drinks (coffee cappuccino orange juice). Service was efficient friendly and quick. Food was excellent. We will definitely go again when we are visiting nyc.' u'Fresh and very good. Presented well and great service and energy.

147.Tri Tip Grill,[u"Came from out of town and Met up with an old colleague of mine for lunch and she brought me here. Now my go to isn't usually salad at all. There's only a few places where I absolutely love the salad and will be the thing I order. I ordered the Cabo Cob with no blue cheese and no avocado. The wait was not too long for Tuesday lunch time maybe about 5 or so minutes? It was no longer than 10 minutes. \n\nHoly moly the salad is really good! It comes with a crispy tortilla so it reminded me of a taco bowl! The dressing is amazing as well I'm not much of a dressing explorer but tried this one and it's one I would purchase for home! The quality is outstanding everything is fresh. Just under $10 for this salad that's not bad at all!" u"I work in the building and eat here a lot I have to say the inconsistency of your food quality service make me upset about half of the time. \n\n1- please keep your operating hours that you have listed so many times I have shown up to a lights of locked door while your listed operating show your open\n\n2- the fries especially the sweet potato fries need to be cook more they are soggy and unseasoned please do something about that. \n\n3- cook the onions more  they are more raw then caramelized  most times so much I've stopped ordering them\n\n4- you think we wouldn't notice that you've changed the size of your bread serving less in the sandwich that's a dirty trick and not a clever one either\n\nSo after saying all this I will say some positive things. Your counter staff is always so nice helpful and patient! Great team you have! You guys have so much potential but I can see you care less because of how busy you are due to the location. Do your self a favor fix the small quality control details and you will have even more working people coming in who spend money every week!" u'For $15 you can get a portobello platter with a couple pieces of oily mushroom caps and some green leaves! Totally worth it!!!\n\nMaybe try not deviating from the more popular items on the menu like I did because frankly I do not understand the high ratings at all.' u"Eh this place has so much potential.. I love a good steak but this place makes me want to moove it. (I'll stop) \n\nI ordered my steak medium rare you can see from my photo it was not rare. The roll was stale. The most memorable thing on my small platter was the roasted vegetables. VEGETABLES. NOT THE MEAT. \n\nA tad pricey yes I'm aware of the location. Yes it needs to be worth the damn price." u'My friend really enjoyed his French dip but he likes dry sandwiches.  My grilled chicken sandwich was dry as the Sahara on a dry bun - disappointing.' u"There are days you want to eat sushi there are days you want to eat burritos and there are days you want a nice filling meal. Tri Tip Grill fills that niche well. With really affordable food--at least for Rockefeller Plaza--that I often struggle to finish it has a level of consistency and speed that I think is pretty unrivaled. I have had their Roadhouse Buck sandwich ($9.99) Salmon sandwich ($10.49) and Grilled Chicken sandwich ($7.49).\n\nService (4/5): As a restaurant that not only serves food for visitors but also for the many employees around Rockefeller Plaza Tri Tip Grill is incredibly fast. My orders are typically ready within 5 minutes. Despite the high traffic of customers the cashiers are always friendly.\n\nFood (3.5/5)\n\nRoadhouse Buck sandwich (4/5): True to their name they do indeed cook up tri tip. This sandwich is packed with thinly sliced tri tip beef fried onions bleu cheese and ranch. I'd recommend putting a little of the horseradish sauce as well. Most impressive about this sandwich was its size. It's actually impossible to take a bite of the sandwich especially when you have the constant fear of getting food stains on your work shirt. And well if you can accomplish such a feat your dentist must be the happiest dentist in the world. The sandwich is pretty straightforward although between the bleu cheese and the fried onions it can be a quite heavy sandwich. (This is where the horseradish really comes into play.)\n\nGrilled Chicken sandwich (3/5): I love a good grilled chicken sandwich; it's almost as delicious as a steak sandwich and causes half the guilt of eating one. This sandwich is served with a few tomatoes and lettuce so it's not nearly as heavy as the Roadhouse Buck. However the chicken itself is very very very dry. Did I say that it's dry? At least the red ranch helped a lot. Still major points for potion size!\n\nSalmon sandwich (3.5/5): As a Seattlelite is it blasphemous if I say that I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon? The salmon at Tri Tip Grill isn't revolutionary in that it makes me suddenly fall in love with grilled salmon but it is pretty decent. I will say that it is overcooked and thus a little dry but the tarragon aioli compensates for the dryness much better than the red ranch helped the dry chicken. When I'm feeling especially homesick maybe I'll come by and order this again.\n\nPulled Pork sandwich (4/5): Frankly I am not the biggest fan of pulled pork sandwiches. More often than not I find that the pulled pork is more like pork flosses in a barbecue bath so I liked that the pulled pork sandwich at Tri Tip were larger chunks and they exercised a light-handed approach to the barbecue sauce. The coleslaw was also fresh and not overly dressed. Altogether this was definitely their best sandwich.\n\nThe convenience factor of Tri Tip Grill is through the roof. It's quick it's more than filling and the food is always passably good. If I could I would give it a 3.5/5 but compared to its competition I think this place deserves the extra half a star.\n\nProtip: the waffle fries are about $3 and they give you a fairly decent portion of my favorite guilty pleasure. It's crispy oily (but not overwhelmingly so) and well-seasoned. Get it." u"I can't get enough of this place. Love their burgers Sweet Potato Fries and of course their Chicken Avocado Salad." u'Catching up on dining experiences while on a trip to the States thought i\'d mention this one in New York in the " underbelly " of the Rockefeller building. The only reason I\'m giving it 4 out of 5 rating is because did not venture out into the decent array of choices on the menu as much as we should have. So have no idea what the other choices are like. This was mainly because we went two times ( or was it three ) during our time in New York and both times I chose the Bacon Cheddar Buck sandwich the main attraction being the thought of cheddar cheese and bacon. Such is my love of cheeses I just had to have it again on the following visit. It is just so delicious....a simple sandwich but cooked and prepared so well. This particular sandwich consists of thinly sliced tri tip steak with red ranch sauce applewood smoked bacon and melted cheddar ( melted to perfection ) in an artisan roll which is said to be baked daily on the premises. As for the other sandwich at our table my " better half" chose a Big Buck....6oz of thinly sliced tri tip steak served with caramelized onions and au jus dipping sauce. My small taste of this was tasty though probably because missing the cheese not as good as my sandwich. As for everything else here...Everyone else around food looked tempting the place was busy as it was lunchtime when we went but still managed to find seats. It helps when there is takeaway option. The service was friendly  the order quick to come out and the tables etc kept clean and tidy. All in all highly recommend.' u"If you're looking for a quick half-decent lunch while in NYC I would suggest stopping by Tri Tip Grill. We stopped by here while we were walking in Rockefeller Plaza on a little day trip.\n\nKeep in mind that it's a tiny little restaurant... not much seating! You may have to wait for someone to get up to find a table.\n\nThey have quite a few different options for sandwiches salads and meal plates to choose from. I personally ordered a Cobb Salad (I can't remember the exact name but it was a Cobb-esque salad) and it was really good. Massive... which is good for the $8.99 price. On Tuesdays if you order a salad they will add steak or pulled pork for free. Cool!\n\nMy mom ordered one of their burgers which looked pretty good as well. My sister ordered a little dip sandwich (can't remember the name either but essentially a roast beef dip) with some sweet potato fries. They were pretty good. It's nice to see other side choices besides the standard french fry.\n\nIt's a little pricey but what do you expect? You're in the city. You're in Rockefeller Plaza... it's essentially a tourist attraction.\n\nNo complaints here! Great meal." u"Today's lunch was a four star experience. The atmosphere was nice. The service prompt and organized. A plus while serving customers during the peak of lunch rush. Not only do they get the local employees but kids from all over the country are on Spring break. The place was jumpin'! \nI had forgotten how much I love the Cabo Chop. I enjoyed it so much. Now I get to suffer the indigestion. I forgot I get that too. Sometimes I just need to suffer for my pleasures....\nIt is a great deal for $9.79 tax included. \nAfter I forget I get indigestion from it I'll be back for the Cabo Chop again!!" u"I'm fairly surprised by the high rating for Tri Tip Grill. This is so mediocre for the price you pay. I'm sure this will offend some people but I've eaten at Waffle Houses for a fraction of the price and received better food. \n\nI thought the steak was underwhelming and very low quality. The tables were tiny so it was hard to eat with my friend and we each just ordered a plate. There needs to be drastic improvements to be made on the food. \n\nMaybe I came on an off-day but I had high expectations and was left just feeling empty." u'I like Tri Tip Grill a lot and could imagine myself frequenting this location for lunch hours. \n\nI actually came here by accident. I was heading to Yummy Sushi which is across Tri Tip in the Rockefellar concurse but happened to notice Tri Tip for the first time and since Yummy Sushi-- contrary to their name is not all that yummy.. I decided to try out Tri Tip! Prices are moderate to what things usually cost in the city.. Approximately $8 for a burger just to give you an idea. \n\nWhen you walk in this place smells amazing!! There were three cashiers available and ready to take my order during lunch rush hour which was great. There was no line and I hardly waited 5 minutes to get my food. Truly an in and out experience. I just quickly went to put some ketchup and BBQ sauce in some to-go containers before I left. As you can see from my photos this crispy chicken sandwich just looks SAD! The presentation is definitely lacking but it was a great sandwich. For approximately $8 I got a (around) 6" sandwich that has a HUGE piece of chicken fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The chicken is not breaded well but there\'s a sweet sauce inside the sandwich that made the overall experience excellent.\n\nIt filled me up and I have no other complaints! Would definitely come back to try other things on the menu' u"I was wandering through the undergrounds of Rockefeller Center and stumbled across this gem. Looking at the menu I knew I would need a big appetite to conquer whatever I was gonna order from here. Good thing I ALWAYS have a big appetite!\n\nI went for the 8 oz tri tip platter and swapped out the mashed potatoes for those crunchy onions strings. Best decision I made all day. The roasted veggies and the crunchy onion strings complimented the beef very well. As far as the meat was concerned it was cooked to my liking (medium rare) BUT without the au jus sauce it would have been a bit bland for me. And I normally do not request extra salt on things. So if they just upped up the flavor (or gave extra au jus) I'd be all set.\n\nP.S. The portion size for this platter was plenty for me. I was able to stretch the food out to cover lunch and dinner!" u"You know how I know a salad is good? It's when I'm actually eating the lettuce- NOT BY FORCE but because it's actually tasty. This place makes damn good salads... and tri tip (obviously!)\n\nOf course I'd get the Tri Tip salad with roadhouse onions and blue cheese decor. Portions were SUPER GENEROUS and that tri tip was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The greens were so well-coated in ranch I found my fork maneuvering through the meats and toppings and straight for the lettuce! Granted that ranch doesn't make it any healthier it still made me feel good and that's all that matters... Right? \n\nThe place is small and finding a seat was only a slight challenge despite not being crowded that day. Not too big a deal though since there's also an indoor food court and the outside world as options. If the prices weren't so hard on my wallet I'd come here everyday!" u"This place is inside the Rockefeller Center downstairs past the Starbucks.\n\nI got a cheeseburger and sweet potato fries.\n\nI enjoyed it.\n\nI'm from the midwest so I've eaten good burgers this was very good.\n\nIt's good for tourists or natives.\n\nI'd go back." u"These days I have been trying many different types of salad and am really getting a sense of hits and misses for many places. Since I'm literally ordering similar stuff everywhere I'm able to conduct some sort of cross comparison.\n\nWhile Tri Tip is not as popular as Chop't or Just salad it indeed provided me a decent chicken avocado salad and I ended up liking the honey lime dressing a lot. The portion was also huge that I could not finish by myself! I'd rather have a 7-8 dollar smaller size than a huge portion with 11 dollars. Hopefully they can customize on portions. I do liked the fact that they allow you to choose between grilled and crispy chicken." u'Spent 20 minutes waiting in line and another 20 minutes waiting for my order after that (Big Buck). A colleague got a chicken sandwich received lukewarm. Sandwich was mediocre and the au jus was more salty than flavorful. Found some improvement through the horseradish sauce.' u"This place was hopping on a cold and rainy day.....That's the only reason it was hopping because people didn't want to leave 30 Rock for better places.\n\nI had a Gross nasty soggy disgusting burger.  The bun was already soaked through by the time I got it the fries were at least 10 minutes past their prime.  Nothing was done right.   I was in a rush so I consumed what I could and moved on.....\n\nGross." u"Tri Tip has tasty sandwiches that are full of meat! It's in a great location downstairs in Rockefeller Center so it's pretty packed but the line moves really quickly. \n\nI got the Big Buck and it was like a big French Dip sandwich. The meat was flavorful and cooked well and wasn't too rare (though my friend got his rare and it looked completely pink; like to the point that I wouldn't eat it). The caramelized onions were soooo good to compliment the meat. They also have really great sweet potato fries!! \n\nI'd definitely recommend Tri Tip for a quick and filling lunch in the city! It was a great pick for the guys in our group that we're looking for lots of meat and protein for lunch!" u"It was that bad. Tri tip that would be difficult to cut with the sharpest of steak knives and they give you plastic forks and knives. I was at a point where I was ready to pick it up with my hands and eat it. Won't be going back"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
8.Dos Caminos,[u"While visiting New York for the first time my cousins and I decided to try this place. We were staying at the Edson Hotel so this was a close walk from the hotel.\nI forgot the name of our drinks but it was amazing !!!! It was margarita something. We ordered appetizers and some dishes... ommmggg! It was so amazingly good!!!! \nWhen we came it was very good timing because it wasn't too busy and it's right next to Time square so you can enjoy watching the bright lights. This was something I took  back to Hawaii... my home... the memories and good food! I'll definitely be back!!!!!" u"The Mexican food at Dos Caminos is absolutely incredible. We ordered a ton of appetizers as we were a large group of 20 in their private room and every single dish was excellent. Their Margaritas were also delicious - I got a frozen but every type seemed to be a hit with our crowd. \n\nThe restaurant itself is in an extremely busy area in Time Square so it is usually very packed. If you are seeing a Broadway show and plan to head here before or after I highly recommend making reservations. \n\nIf you're in the mood for Mexican I definitely recommend heading here!" u"The server Nicholas was knowledgeable and attentive and super helpful. The hostesses were courteous. The place was spotless and they had plenty (I think 5) of single room bathrooms.\n\n The main dishes were ok.\nThe squid dish  chicken enchilada and braised short rib were overcooked and tasted like comfort food. None of the crisp garlic and unique spices that we experienced at the Village branch before.\n\nThe appetizers and drinks were terrific!\n The guacamole with 3 salsas were great  as were the drinks. Blood Orange Mule Frozen Prickly Pear Margarita  and Tempranillo wine were delicious.\n\nI'd come here for drinks excellent service and appys but check out the one between W B'way & W Houston for delicious entrees." u"I stopped by for drinks while being touristy in Times Square. The bar area allows for excellent people-watching and the margarita was a good deal for Manhattan at $12. (Albeit it was in the weaker side but still worth the $12.) I've been to Dos Caminos in Atlantic City before and loved it-this was no exception." u"Walking in I didn't think this place served authentic Mexican food but I stand corrected. I ordered the Chile Relleno a la carte & a side of guacamole. A lot of restaurants use canned poblano peppers because it's a long process to make this dish but Dos Caminos uses fresh poblanos. \nOur server was very attentive & although this location is in Times Square there was no wait. \nThe only thing I didn't like was the dessert. A different server brought out the Pistachio Crepes & poured the entire caramel (cajeta) over the crepes. It was way too much caramel. Unfortunately we weren't able to enjoy it. I'd recommend this place for lunch but there are plenty other places to go for dessert." u"Happy hours prices are great! $6 sangrias that are tasty and full of fruit. The happy hour quesadilla was a great treat that I'd order again. I suggest everyone try Dos Caminos atleast once. This location has a bar upstairs as well as a lounge with a bar downstairs." u"The food and service was really good.  It was a little pricey for mexicAn but you kinda have to expect that being right on Times Square.  Great view from the front bar area.  I had the steak fajita style meal and it was excellent.  My wife has the quesadillas and we weren't a fan (was more like a Mexican pizza with cheese on top). \n\nI liked the chips with 3 different salsas as well." u"I am so disappointed in this restaurant. Visited on Friday night with my husband and cousin. My cousin and I ordered our food at the same time. Hers was brought out  and after she had finished ( about 20 minutes later) I never received my food and my server was no where to be found to inquire the status of my meal. I ended up having to ask another server to let our server know that I hadn't received my meal and wanted to cancel it. It seems that the staff isn't very attentive. I would not return to this restaurant. There wasn't a large variety of interesting menu items." u'Great place. Good food. Services was ok too. They really try to offer authentic food. Not the real deal but pretty decent.' u"We had an hour to kill to we stopped by for a quick drink during happy hour and a nosh. They have specials but you have to be sitting in a special area to receive them. Confusing. \n\nBut once that was cleared up we got a good margarita and some guacamole at a price that didn't break the bank. Add to that service that was friendly and helpful and comfortable lounge we really couldn't complain. For right on Times Square it was a decent find. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it's a good call when you need something in the area." u'A delicious Mexican restaurant/bar right in Times Square. I recommend visiting during Happy Hour to catch some extra deals. This is weekdays from 3-6 pm and 9-minute midnight. The tequila flight is $10 during this time and the personal size chips guacamole and salsa is just $6. The staff was very friendly and the food tasted very fresh!' u"I heard this place was great but I was not impressed. Overpriced food with mediocre taste and small portions. We shared the guacamole as an appetizer it was good but nothing special. And I got the quesadillas potosinas which was similar to an empanada filled with corn and peppers. I probably won't be back. The service was not that great also. The restaurant was packed and loud for dinner time. There was no tables available when we went so we sat at a high top bar area." u"Don't want to eat at any of the chains around Times Square? While Dos Caminos seems like a chain on the outside hidden downstairs is an excellent authentic Mexican restaurant with fantastic atmosphere. We got the Taco Platter which is a sampling of all the tacos they offer. The stand outs were the Steak and Pork tacos. The only complaint is that it is a little pricey but some would say it's worth it. If you are in midtown and enjoy Mexican cuisine definitely give Dos Caminos a try. We will definitely be coming back!" u"I have visited this location a few times since it's really close to my office and all of the times have been super enjoyable (until you open the doors and have to walk through the obstacle course/death trap which is Times Square). My office has held happy hours guacamole-making classes in their downstairs private room and lunches here. The staff is super accommodating and the food is very good.\n\nIt is a little pricey if you're doing the whole enchilada (get it)-- drinks guac (typically $16-20 for that dish itself) or an app a main dish and dessert-- so be wary. I will say however that you are getting some delicious grub. Complimentary rice & beans with any of their entrees.\n\nAmbiance-wise it's beautifully decorated upstairs but my favorite is the main dining room downstairs which has a colorful and fun bar set up with an adjacent room filled with tables and booth seating. They also have a private room downstairs for events.\n\nThe last few times I have been I have enjoyed the:\n\n- Mac & Chorizo ($8): it's a side but honestly you can enjoy it as an app too spicy with jalepenos on top and pinwheel pasta\n- Platanos Empanadas ($11): sweet empanadas that are soft and topped with queso-- from the street food section of the menu\n- Enchiladas de Queso Estilo Laredo (Cheese Enchiladas - $19): crispy and completely drenched in a smoky sauce made with guajillo chillies\n\nI say come here for happy hour (3-6 PM and 9PM -close) where you can get drinks for $4-8 and food for $6. Overall a great place but just in a a congested location." u"Decided to go in for a Margarita and some guac at 3:05pm since the sign said Happy Hour from 3-6. Ask the bartender (Morgan) about the Happy Hour specials and she states with a nasty attitude that it wasn't until 3:30pm. Asked her again and pointed out the menu and said the sign also said 3 which she again said with another attitude that it wasn't until 3:30. Decided to order a couple of beers anyways and when the bill came at 3:25 what the hell do you know...beers were priced for Happy Hour. We missed out on our guac or margs cus she misinformed us with an attitude. Maybe she's a better fit somewhere else but definitely not here!" u"Great location- smack in the middle of Times Square and right by the theater district. \n\nFirst time I came for dinner it's usually packed so make reservations!! I had the Baja tacos which were amazinggggg! You definitely have to order these tacos at least once in your life! \n\nLast Thursday I came after watching the Carole King broadway show which was perfect since they have happy hour from 9-close (only in bar lounge)! I order the taco duo which was a pork taco and a chicken taco for only $6! Tacos were good. I ordered a personal guacamole to add to them which was a great touch! The chips came with salsa the salsa verde was my fav! \n\nService was great we sat by the bar and Luis attended to us. Bar area was packed up until closing." u'Dos Caminos was great! Came here with my boyfriend for drinks and food and the staff was attentive the drinks were kinda pricy but they were worth it ! Margarita game strong ...just wish they had more flavors. We had the queso fundido with chorizo and it was soooooo good!!\n\n\nWill deff come back!' u'This review is strictly for the happy hour. Go downstairs to the lounge cool vibe. The margaritas 1/2 off and made with so much love truly are delicious -- so is the array of salsa and chips. The bartenders are super nice!! Location sucks with waves of tourist but worth the trek.' u"Went here before a show. This place was definitely a step up from the horrible chain restaurants in the area but still get you seated served and out quick. They really do a great job catering to the theater crowd who are limited on time. We ordered the guacamole which was terrific. The margaritas were also very good pretty strong. The food was good. No it wasn't the best Mexican food ive ever had but it was still very tasty. Highly recommend making reservations if you plan on going before or after a show." u'Having been to several locations of Dos Caminos I feel like I can offer a pretty fair review of not only this location in Times Square but on the franchise as a whole. Of all the locations I\'ve been to the Times Square one is probably the last one I\'d voluntarily come to; it\'s crowded across all hours filled by tourists and those who work and live in the area. There\'s an upstairs and downstairs both with their own bar / lounge areas and dining rooms but even having that additional capacity isn\'t much help to the sheer volume of guests that need to be accommodated.\n\nThe food is pretty standardized across all the locations as well and there are definitely hits and misses across the board. I would not recommend avoiding the ceviche; the one instance we did the red snapper used tasted far from fresh. Instead stick with the Street Corn (preferably off the cob) the foolproof Guacamole (which you can pick based on several levels of spice) or the melt-y Chorizo Fundido which is both exceedingly messy to eat as the dip will no doubt stretch with your chip but delightful for any cheese-lover.\n\nAs for the entrees I wouldn\'t recommend the Shrimp Quesadilla which is an open-face quesadilla dotted with grilled shrimp a drizzle of crema and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes. Despite its popularity with diners it was far from impressive in both flavors and substance. Instead go for the Mole Short Ribs which are tender and served with savory-sweet mole sauce and come with a delicious "Mexican risotto" - a luxurious rice and vegetable side that has just the right amount of cream and cheese to offer a comparable version to the traditional Italian dish. Their sides shouldn\'t be overlooked either; the fries are crisp and generously portioned and the sweet-spicy mole ketchup they\'re served with is pretty addictive.\n\nDessert is often overlooked but if you have room for it get an order of the Mexican Sundae which starts with a horchata and coffee ice cream base adds on salted peanuts and whipped cream with a fudge and caramel sauce on the side and finishes the dish off with two churro sticks. It\'s a delicious amalgamation of flavors and textures and the portion is perfect for two people to share. \n\nIf you\'re in a bit of a bind and need somewhere with a little more predictability to eat at Dos Caminos will certainly do the trick... but if you\'re looking to go beyond slightly over-priced Mexican food a quick trip to Jackson Heights or Prospect Park and you\'ll find considerably more authentic and affordable options.'],0.5423,0.084,0.916,0.0
42.Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House,[u"This was a bucket list restaurant for me. I wanted to come here for years. I marched in the NYC Veteran's Day parade and it ended nearby.\n\nI came to the steakhouse and it was as amazing as I thought. The lobster bisque was delicious. The steak was huge perfectly cooked and tender. So flavorful each mouthful was heaven! Their house cab is delicious.\n\nSomeone nearby bought my dinner which shocked me but the staff treated me like a hero throughout. They value Veterans and I felt like a rock star.\n\nThank you for your wonderful food and service.\n\nMy opinion only of course but amazing!!" u"This place is a luxury to go to because they're so good but so expensive. The service was top notch and very attentive. The servers were good at making the table laugh. For appetizers we ordered the crab cakes and the beef carpaccio. Main dish was ribeyes mac n cheese an truffle butter.\n\nAppetizers: the crab cakes were full of flavor and very juicy. It was great because I'm used to eating them mostly breaded and fried but these were mostly crab and not fried. Tasted really fresh. They did bring out the wrong appetizer to our table but quickly brought out the right one. The carpaccio was great it kind of melts in your mouth when you eat it. Just wish there was more for the price you pay.\n\nSteak: ribeye was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Really good to eat with the truffle butter and creamy mac n cheese." u"The place for steak on a special occasion in NYC. It's a great place to bring your guests clients and family for a fancy meal. I'm sure that there are other better places for steak in NYC at more affordable prices but Del Frisco's offers high class service and an ambience that is hard to find elsewhere. It's not your everyday restaurant but it guarantees quality necessary for an important night out.\n\n-- \ntaste / 4\naesthetics / 4\nvibe / 5\nservice / 5\nprice for quality / 3\nOVERALL / 4.5" u'The service was superb and the staff was attentive.  I felt as if we were waited on hand foot from the second we stepped in to the second we stepped out.\nI ordered the sirloin medium well and this was the first time ever that the waiter asked me to cut my steak when it arrived.  I proceeded to cut the meat and noticed it was too red.  I said it was too red and the waiter said let it cook on the plate for a minute or two.  Two minutes later my steak was medium.  Bravo bravo I must say!' u'I came to Del Frisco\'s and had an amazing dinner.\n\nDel Frisco\'s is your classic New York steakhouse. The ambiance is classy and relaxing. When we arrived we started at the bar and ordered the "Signature VIP" drink which was a Vodka pineapple drink. The drinsk were excellent and well made. For dinner we had the following...\n\nFilet Mignon: I opted for the 8oz which appeared small but was more than enough I couldn\'t even finish it. The steak was very well seasoned and cooked at the perfect temperature.\nLobster Mac n\' cheese: The mac n\' cheese was amazing. The lobster was tender and the flavor was delicious.\nMashed potatoes in a lobster bisque: This dish was a special of the night and not on the menu but oh my gosh was it amazing. The lobster bisque sauce was to die for! If this is available to order I would highly recommend. \n\nOverall the service and the food was superb. If you are looking for good steak in NYC I would definitely recommend Del Frisco\'s!!' u"One simply cannot do NYC without a visit to a steakhouse.  While there are several great ones in Manhattan I've never been disappointed in Del Frisco.  So when a group of us decided to enjoy a great dinner it's where we ended up.\n\nAnd it didn't disappoint.  Great bar.  Great staff.  And da.  amn.  Great Steak.  Each of us tried a different cut each of us cleared our plates.\n\nGo.  Enjoy.  Da bom." u"My feedback is 2 fold: \n\nFood \n- lobster bisque - Amazing.  Soup was great and it had a lot of large pieces of lobster too\n- Sides were great!  Tried lobster mac n cheese .  The cheese blend was delicious and a lot of large lobster inside. \n- potatoes au gratin were okay.   Probably pass  on them \n- Filet was perfect.   I do like a side of bernaise but I didn't ask for reasons I'll mention below on the service \n\nService \n- this is what dropped it from 4 stars to 3\n- to set my expectations... I've been to other chains like Ruth Chris and Morton's and their service is perfect and always exceed expectations\n- also this was a special occasion.  Surprised my boyfriend with dinner.  Got a new gown makeup hair the works... really wanted him to feel special.  Asked for a good view birthday candle with dessert sounded like they would deliver \n- long story short is we waited then waited some more then waited longer\n- had to check on each thing along the way... Asked for bread and it never came and he had to follow up with whoever.  \n-Meal took 30 minutes after appetizer to come out which he acknowledged but preemptively saying it was coming\n- Had to ask for water in an empty glass.  May seem minor but at a nice restaurant they are attentive and you don't need to ask for minor things like water.\n- took so long for the meal that it was late and we were too tired to wait for dessert.  I was looking forward to him being presented a candle lit dessert\n\nIf you're just going for a good meal you'll probably be fine.  Because I had gone all out to make this a special event and even he noticed and commented how bad the service was just made me even more so disappointed.  All the effort I had gone through and perfection was ruined because we didn't get the service one expects at a nice $$$$ restaurant.   \n." u"This place is simply amazing. As an upscale steak house it does not disappoint in service or taste. Even though I did not have an alcoholic beverage I saw many people order martinis which looked pretty nice. The bread always came out warm and the server was constantly attentive to our needs (and we're a pretty needy bunch). We had the oysters escargot shripm cocktail and crab cakes for our appetizers and they certainly did NOT disappoint. If you did not tell me I was eating escargot I would have thought they were just really good mushrooms because it did not taste like snail at all (in a good way). I don't think their crab cake was traditionally pan-fried which made it all the better. Hands down the best crab cake I've had in my life. \n\nThe only downside was all of our steaks were the wrong temperature. We were a party of 7 and might have confused the server a bit but what could have gone wrong that 7 pieces of steak were all mixed up in temperature? The staff fixed this issue right away though and we all received the right meats with additional complimentary desserts for the trouble. Nonetheless the seasoning on the steak was spectacular. I recommend getting the truffle butter which tastes good on pretty much everything. The sides were to die for as well. The onion rings are huge and great for the picture but were a little soggy after sitting out for a while.\n\nIf you can drop by Del Frisco's anytime I would highly suggest doing so!" u'We kind of stumbled across this spot tonight after a long walk through Times Square had our feet sore enough to need a break as we tried to plot our next move. \nWe walked in and sat at the bar as we thought we would only get a quick drink and a bathroom break. But we ended up getting one of our best experiences of our entire 3-day vacation here. \nWhile the wife was freshening up I ordered the lamb sliders and casually mentioned to the bartender Briana that I would wait to order my wine until my wife got back because it was our anniversary and I wanted to see if she wanted champagne or wine. A bit of an overshare moment on my behalf some may say but the bartender heard me and sprung into action. \n\nShe started us off with a couple glasses of complimentary champagne which made me want to stay and at least have dessert too. \n\nThe lamb sliders were delicious - we paired it with a Chianti and I thought it was great.\n\nI asked Briana which dessert she thought I shouldn\'t leave without tasting - the butter cake was her immediate and adamant response so we ordered it. \n\nShe brought it out to us on a platter with a candle and a "happy anniversary" AND a lava cake. \n\nIt was just the best service we had our entire trip and it made us feel incredibly happy and welcome.\n\nIt\'s truly an amazing feeling when you go to a place and leave feeling like celebrities because of the attentiveness and caliber of service received. \n\nAs anyone reading through reviews probably already knows the place is pretty expensive but you\'re not only paying for food you\'re getting top-notch customer service that will make you want to come back whether the food was great or not. But the food is also really good!\n\nSo come here! Ask for Briana as your bartender if you go to the bar. Tell her the anniversary couple from New Orleans sent you.' u"Excellent steakhouse experience! It was my first time and everything was great. Beautiful modern decor. Very spacious with high ceilings and windows. I had good service. The rib eye was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was so tender! BF also enjoyed his strip steak. The lobster mac n cheese was also delicious. Complimentary generous bday desert. The butter cake was amazing. I had rsvp and surprised how packed it was on a Tue night. The crowd looks wealthy and important but not super stuffy. No manager made rounds to our table but I understand it is a large restaurant. I'll be back. Worth the money!" u'I\'d rate the food overall 3.5 stars although if you come I highly recommend the king crab gnocchi side and the escargot appetizer. And unless you actually like your steak bloody I\'d recommend ordering your steaks "medium" as opposed to the usually recommended medium rare.\n\nEscargot appetizer- escargot on top of bread dipped in a creamy white sauce. The sauce was delicious.\n\nKing crab gnocchi- creamy white sauce was also delicious. Gnocchi were filled with crab meat and it was a burst of crabby flavor with every bite. Probably the beat thing I ate all night\n\nMushroom side: really salty. I was not feeling it.\nCauliflower side: it was ok\n\nPorterhouse steak: I asked for medium rare but it seemed rarer than what most other restaurants usually do. The steak was seasoned well with salt. It was really really chewy cuz it was so rare. Overall i thought the steak was ok. It was heavy so I couldn\'t finish the whole steak myself. Think I only ate half of it and bagged the rest\n\nService was nice.' u"I don't think I can say that Del Frisco's is the best steakhouse in New York City. I do not even think Del Frisco's themselves can make that bold statement. However In a city with such historical quality restaurants DF is able to noticeably stand out and it's no mystery why once you've came here. \n\nHalf the experience of any restaurant is the setting decor servers etc the other obviously being the food. DF is able sweep you off your feet this marvelous Goliath of a restaurant is situated right in the heart of Manhattan. The inside matches the outside two large floors covered in a sea of tables and happy patrons. This may be the most beautifully laid out restaurant you will ever attend. \n\nOn to the good stuff. This passed Friday we attended DF for restaurant week. I chose the mixed greens 8 oz filet and cheesecake. Additionally we ordered the infamous onion rings. \n\nThe salad so simple yet so perfect. It's as easy to mess a salad up as it is to make it absolutely perfect. Refreshing balsamic dressing with freshly made croutons made this salad top shelf. Next I ordered my filet Medium+ it was cooked absolutely perfect. Every bite as tender as the bite before. The onion rings accompanying my filet sized like donuts you would see at Dunkin each crispy and covered in a smooth crunchy dough. Finally the cheesecake so rich and creamy every bite was pure bliss. \n\nFor the value ($29) I would come here everyday. Unfortunately this lunch would probably run you around 60 on a regular day. That being said I will return again and again. Del Frisco's keep doing what you're doing." u"I've been here countless times over the past 10 years and I can't believe I've never written a review!! Del Frisco's has been my favorite steakhouse in NYC for the past decade not just because of the food but also because of their phenomenal service.\n\nI recently dined here to celebrate my friend's and my own birthday. It was acknowledged promptly after we sat at our table. The three of us opted for the business lunch which is a fantastic value. You get a choice of salad and entree for $32 which is such a steal at this restaurant. My caesar salad was dressed perfectly. I ordered the salmon which was a large portion size and came accompanied by the most delicious crab meat hash. My friends had the filet medallions which came on a bed of mashed potatoes and haricot vert. \n\nOur waiter came to check in on us frequently but the end of the meal is where they go above and beyond. He gave us a complimentary dessert plate with candles and all. It was so sweet of him and of course was delicious. As we were exiting the restaurant the waiter gave me a card that was signed by the staff to wish us happy birthday. Del Frisco's will continue to be my favorite restaurant in NYC now." u'Came in this past weekend to celebrate a birthday. My brother in law had been dying to come here for awhile so we finally took the plunge. It lived up to all we had heard. From the gorgeous venue to the solid food and top notch service it was all on point.\n\nI would highly recommend trying the bacon app here. It was cooked perfect with a bit of a peppercorn crust (as most of the steaks were cooked as well). The Tuna Tartar was also delicious. \n\nFor dinner I tried a bone in filet which was good. But I actually enjoyed the 16oz strip off the menu better. And that is not a cut I normally would go for. The guys that went with the famous Wagyu ribeye had nothing but high praise for their cuts. Was told it was the best ribeye that both of them had ever eaten. The sides we had were all perfect. We left nothing behind. Lobster mac King Crab Gnocchi Shaved Brussels Sprouts Potatos Au Gratin Cauliflower Au Grotin Maque Choux Corn.\n\nDrinks were excellent as well but be prepared for upwards of $20 a cocktail. Dessert was to die for. They took very good care of the birthday boy. We tried alittle of the two desserts they brought him and one of the two was insane. Half the table then went ahead and ordered their own Butter Cakes. Which came with a scoop of pecan ice cream. Without any hesitation I will say I have never eaten a better dessert in my life. If you come here you must order this.' u"Their fillet mignon with peppercorn sauce and mashed potato IS what you should order!  When I said rare - it is rare!  The peppercorn sauce was excellent.  I love the scallion-butter-full mashed potatoes.\n\nTheir desserts are good too.  I like the way they make the light cheesecake.  The bread pudding needs to be served warmer so it is softer.  But I liked it with the caramel sauce.  It's a good American steak house with ambience and good service.\n\nFood is good quality!" u"Came here on a Saturday night with the wife for an 8:30 reservation.  It was packed and we still had to wait about 10 minutes but the wait was worth it. \n\nAmbience is your typical classic fancy steakhouse. Great service throughout. \n\nDrinks were nice and strong. My wife had a nice light rose and I got a maple Manhattan which was a bit too sweet for my tastes. \n\nWhat was better was the food. I have been here a few times for lunch and usually had the steak salad which is bomb diggity but decided to go all out for dinner. We ordered the escargot appetizer 32 oz wagyu tomahawk lobster mac and cheese and potatoes au gratin.  Everything was phenomenal! \n+ escargot = not your typical. It came with the snails on top of bread and covered with an amazing creamy sauce.  My wife who typically doesn't like escargot or cream sauces actually liked it! \n+ lobster mac and cheese = nice large chunks of lobster\n+ potatoes au gratin = cheesy and packed with flavor\n+ wagyu tomahawk = sooooooooo tasty. We shared this and it was perfectly done. Nice and juicy with just the perfect amount of salt. It was almost to beautiful to eat ... almost\n\nWe'll definitely be back again!" u'I have been coming to Del Friscos for year now and I can still say I have had a pleasant experience everytime!  The food is great..(I think it\'s the best steakhouse in NYC).  The ambience is very much like NYC formal steakhouse feel.  I am a Fillet Girl and the fillet here is so good I never ask for any sauce! My favorite appetizers are their calamari (they may not have it on the menu but you can ask! It\'s thai style with a sweet and spicy sauce) and crabcakes. But I love love love their fillet mignon!!!\n\nP.S.  The last time I was there saw some "working ladies" at the bar scouting for rich men.  I mean hey..a girl\'s gotta earn a living right?  They had fancier accessories than I can afford :-D.  But it was fun to people watch.' u"I use to be a huge fan of Del Frisco's. I work in the same building as this restaurant so I would come here quite often. I didn't have a good experience during my last lunch visit. My co-worker and I both had OVER-COOKED steak. Sorry. This is NOT acceptable at a steakhouse. I ordered a medium rare and it came well-done. \n\nAnother annoying issue was the bill was also incorrect. It took the server three attemps to fix it. The service was really slow. It took forever to let the server know that it was incorrect in the first place. She brings it back and it was incorrect again. They overcharged us for several items including a bottle of wine." u"As part of my trip to NY my boyfriend and I wanted to go big one night and splurge on some amazing steak. Unfortunately we did not have such an experience here. \n\nWe were able to make reservations quite easily for calling in only one day before. Service was accommodating and friendly.  Food was mediocre. What's sad is that the side dishes stole the show for us when it really should have been the steaks. My boyfriend and I both asked for our steaks to be medium rare but when it was presented to us it was still raw in the middle. It was more rare than it was medium rare so we had to send it back to cook a bit more. When it came back it hit the point of no return. It was then medium well instead of what we orginially asked for... Bummer... My favorite dish that we ordered was actually the king crab gnocchi. It was so creamy and rich and the gnocchi was soft and melted in your mouth. I wish it had more king crab in it though. The creamed spinach was also pretty good. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and we thought it was okay. \n\nOverall for being such an expensive restaurant we expected better quality food. You can honestly get way better steak at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for a lower price. i would not recommend this steakhouse to anyone." u"Del Frisco's is the restaurant that you ought to love.  Picturesque views iconic location and delicious steaks.  Sadly their service leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nWe originally made a reservation to dine at Del Frisco's two weeks ago.  Upon checking in we were seated on the ground floor next to the staircase and adjacent to one of their private dining rooms.  That's completely unacceptable.  First of all the table should not exist.  I understand that the business objective is to maximize revenue per square foot but there a limit on that concept.  Second do not seat reserved guests in that table.  Allocate it to walk-ins.  I notified the wait staff and we were relocated to a seat in front of the window overlooking 6th Avenue.  I appreciated their willingness to accommodate my request.\n\nAs for the meal it felt incredibly rushed.  We started with the marinated shrimp as an appetizer along with two vodka martini's.  Perfect amount of garlic!  \n\nThis is where it went wrong.  The waiter asked my date to take the remaining shrimp from the serving plate and place it in her dish to make room for our impending meal.  Shortly thereafter our steaks (ribeye and strip) were placed on the table along with our sides.  Space out the meal!  This is restaurant 101 stuff!  \n\nThe ribeye was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked (after I requested for it to be sent back to the kitchen to cook further).  The strip was a bit over salted but otherwise cooked well.\n\nShockingly the restaurant did not offer us an additional alcoholic beverage.  It's an easy up-sell!  If the meal were spaced out appropriately we would have consumed at least a glass of wine a piece.\n\nI would not return as a NYC local."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
66.Zawa Japanese,[u"Zawa is a very special place where you can experience a 5-star quality omakase-- some of the freshest fish over beautifully seasoned rice with just the right touch of soy for a fraction of the price of other fine establishments. Is it as good as some of the power sushi houses of NYC (i.e. Nakazawa Ichimura 15 East etc)? No but I'd say it's 70% as good for half the price. \n\nChef Makoto Yoshizawa-san of Sushi Dojo fame newly opened Zawa only a few months ago in the UES. The zen atmosphere and lighting highlights the beautiful wood bar that wouldn't be a hair out of place in Tokyo proper. The Chef does the ambience justice with piece by glorious piece of sushi. Sublime pieces of hamachi melt in your mouth luxurious kinmadai kissed with a touch of yuzu dazzle and amaze and of course the trio of maguro-- akami chutoro otoro-- is out of this world. A tasting of a 10 piece omakase and handroll (with soup or salad) will set you back $65 and a 15 piece for $95 is also offered. \n\nMy only gripe is that the service is a tad confused at times and the kitchen is easily overwhelmed by hot foods. But for the quality of the sushi at this price point these small hiccups are just that. \n\nCome for a visit. Order the sushi omakase sit in front of the head chef and leave the California roll orders at home. Trust me your taste buds and wallet will thank you." u"Best traditional sushi I've had in NY with reasonable prices\nScallop and toro cannot be missed.\nRice is incredible with the perfect consistency temperature and taste" u'Zawa did not disappoint at all! The restaurant is extremely clean with a simple/minimal design. We got the Sushi for two for $80 and had more than enough food. This consisted of 18 pieces of sushi and three rolls. The sushi was extremely fresh. Our chef served us tuna red snapper ocean trout Scottish salmon fatty tuna amberjack eel shrimp and salmon roe. The chef was accommodating with what we liked and did not like. The three roles were a spicy tuna shrimp tempura and California roll. \n\nIt is safe to say that we will be back to this hidden gem. \n\nSalmon roe was out of this world!!' u'Excellent Omakase served in a simple setting.  At par with some of the top NYC sushi omakase places in quality - at far reasonable prices.' u"Just opened \nExcellent Japanese sushi bar.\n\nHighly recommend the appetizer shrimp shumai made with actual shrimp.\nSushi for two is excellent with great selection of fish and very tasty rice... Soy sauce is homemade by the chef.\n\nI haven't tried the omakase but it looks amazing too.\n\nSelection of Sake is great\nStaff is very careful. Really happy to this brilliant addition to the neighborhood." u'If I had written this review before coming back a second time tonight (November 9 2017) then my review would have been a raving 5-star one. Unfortunately my second experience with the $65 omakase fell very short of the high expectations that had been set by my first dining experience here (October 12 2017). Today\'s experience was more like a 2 star review (either the omakase got seriously down graded or a huge mistake was made). Staff however gets 5 stars all around. \n\nTo start I love the atmosphere. Neither the bar nor tables are cramped. There is ample space and parties are spaced far enough apart that you will never have trouble talking to those next to you. The lighting is bright yet warm and the decor is clean and minimal. The staff is very friendly and try their best to accommodate customers. Today was my dad\'s birthday and I requested an earlier reservation plus a little something with eel as my dad is diabetic (so no sweets) and loves eel. Multiple people wished my dad a happy birthday throughout our meal and he got a little birthday treat. It was really lovely. I also had the pleasure of speaking to Chef Makoto my first time here as I had a seat at the sushi bar (we got a table today).\n\nI was disappointed to see that the lotus root tempura has been taken off the menu. It was really delicious. Tonight we ordered the ebi shumai and maitake tempura to start. The shumai was good but nothing too special. The maitake tempura like the lotus root tempura had a wonderfully light and crispy batter with a delicious tentsuyu. I highly recommend any of their tempura. My mom got the salmon teriyaki my dad got the una jyu and I got the Omakase 10. My mom got some kind of eel and avocado roll last time and I had the only omakase available (which was also $65). As expected prices have gone up. In October I got 12 pieces of sushi miso soup and a handroll. Now the $65 omakase comes with 10 pieces of sushi miso soup and a hand roll. I\'d also stay away from their rice bowls. The portions are very small for entrees that are $30+. My parents seemed to really enjoy their dishes but I was very disappointed this time around. \n\nLast time the fish to rice to wasabi ratio was perfect. The fish was also undeniably fresh and I was given a toro scallion hand roll to finish off my meal. Today I had to take out so much wasabi from my sushi. The first two pieces I ate were very unbalanced. I felt like I had fire shooting out of my nose (you know when you eat too much wasabi or horseradish at once). I couldn\'t stop myself from gasping and making a face. The fish selection was also very boring. I ordered the omakase yet received no seared pieces OR UNI! I was really shocked to see that there was no uni on either of my plates! When I asked the waitress if the omakase no longer came with uni she went to the sushi bar and talked to the other sushi chef (not Makoto the head chef and owner). She came back with a piece of uni sushi and said that the sushi chef made a mistake. This really makes me wonder if I was even given the actual omakase fish selection or the other sushi selections on the menu (there\'s an option that says "10 pieces of popular sushi" versus the omakase that is "the chef\'s selection"). Considering how I got two pieces of salmon no torched pieces and no uni I have a strong hunch that this might have occurred. Oh and no sauces were brushed on any of the pieces. I was given a side of soy sauce... was this really the omakase? This was really a step down compared to the pieces I got last time (especially since I said no oyster or ebi so theoretically I should have gotten the rest of the 10 pieces I had last time). The more I think about it the more I wonder if I was charged for an omakase when I was mistakenly given the other sushi entree. The hand roll I recieved was also extremely disappointing. It was salmon with some kind of spicy mayo... Considering that the salmon did not taste as fresh as last time I was very disappointed. The toro piece I received tonight also was a huge letdown. I love fatty tuna but am hardly picky about it. It left a stale and fishy taste in my mouth. I\'ve never experienced that before and I\'ve had toro in some sketchy places before. \n\nPerhaps the lesson is to sit at the sushi bar and only have Makoto make your omakase. I really want to give the restaurant another chance (especially since I live literally one cross street away) but if I return I may just stick to other items on the menu. I feel very sad maybe it\'s because I so very much want to love this place as much as I did before I returned today...' u"Zawa Japanese is one of the latest addition to a relatively quiet Japanese restaurant scene on the Upper East Side.\n\nZawa's owner and head chef Makoto was previously the head chef at Sushi Dojo so expect nothing less than incredibly fresh sushi.\n\nFirst impressions: quiet zen-like decor -- very Japanese. \n\nI ordered the $65 omakase which is incredible value for the caliber of sushi you get. Price-wise it's far more palatable than at other 'power-sushi' establishments just the right consistency and just the right amount of vinegar (rice is important and it isn't easy to get rice right; the sushi rice at Shuko is mushier than powdered mashed potatoes and the amount of vinegar at Nakazawa hits you like a blunt force trauma). Fish of course is sublime and far fresher than what you'd get at nearby Gari (which is nothing more than a peddler of snake-oil sushi).\n\nEvery piece of sushi from the omakase is labored over to create a work of art. Scallop dotted with the faintest dab of yuzu pepper horse mackerel with thin slices of ginger superbly fatty chutoro (medium fatty tuna) scored across the band of the fish; sweet creamy lobes of Santa Barbara uni -- it's as legit as it gets. \n\nArguably the best-kept secret in the UES so go before the books get filled with reservations. You'll thank me later." u"My favorite Japanese restaurant in Manhattan ! Zawa is definitely a gem on the upper east side. Very fresh ingredients and the fish is just insanely good ! I've been here for countless times since it opened cause it's just amazing. The price is also very reasonable for the amount you get for each dish you order. The vibe here is also chill and relaxing which is something you'd rarely find in Manhattan. Deffo recommend !" u'The sushi is fabulous! Ordered sushi omakaze and had such a fun experience. The fish was so fresh fatty and amazing.' u'This is now the best sushi on the ues and probably in nyc. Amazing quality fish friendly staff great atmosphere. All rolls are delicious apetizers as well. Highly recommend the spicy scallop.' u"Just came here for a friends birthday and we all ordered the omakase. It's been a great experience and I was actually blown away by the texture and taste of the experience. The service is great and I plan to recommend this place to my family and friends. Luckily I think Zaea isn't well known yet so we didn't have to wait for dinner. This place is undoubtedly worth a try." u'Ate here once and really enjoyed it.  Second time was a really BAD experience.  The sushi took forever to come out even though there Place was not crowded.  While the other 2 people in my party were served they completely forgot my order.  The waitress came back and said it would be 5 minutes for my order - after waiting for almost an hour initially I just said to forget it.  No apology or any recognition of this delay and error.  \nWhile the sushi quality was great at the initial visit the place is not ready for prime time.  NOT RECOMMENDED.' u'Excellent sushi dinner experience w/ my family.  Looking forward to returning for our next sushi dinner outing.' u'If you love authentic fresh sushi served in a comfortable elegant setting you will love this brand new restaurant. The chef/owner himself prepares the incredibly fresh impeccably selected fish. We had the sushi for two and the chef kindly asked if we had any allergies or preferences and then proceeded to amaze us with his offering. Everything was so fresh juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tasty. The kitchen menu is still in progress (as the website notes) so we look forward to seeing what gets added. Will return soon.' u'My wife and daughter went here to place an order to go. While we were waiting we decided to order a few pieces of sushi and we met the owner. I found out that he studied in Japan and has worked in other Japanese restaurants in NYC. He was very nice and knowledgeable about the tuna selections (quality location etc). He is humble and nice. The food is high quality and comparable to high end sushi restaurants that we have eaten at in NYC. We we definitely be back!\n\nWe ordered:\nBig eye tuna sushi\nBig eye tuna sashimi \nTuna avocado rolls \nSalmon cucumber rolls\nShrimp dumplings \nEdamame \nMiso soup\n\nEverything was delicious \n\n*The spicy mayo was just ok.' u'What a fantastic omakase particular for the price. Its great to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood and especially one of this caliber. The sushi chef was extremely friendly and the rest of the staff very accommodating. It was so nice to sit at the small sushi bar and watch the head chef prepare every piece of sushi and sashimi with such precision and care. Definitely returning.' u"I had a recommendation from a friend (who knows their way around Japanese food) about Zawa which had recently opened on the upper east side. I don't get to the UES often but Zawa was 100% worth going out of my way for. My friend and I had the omakase paired with a bottle of sake. Each piece of sushi was more delicious than the one before. Sitting at the Sushi bar the Chef/owner was very friendly while highly focused on his craft. The space was elegantly designed balanced with a clean contemporary atmosphere and well crafted wood details. A very authentic Japanese experience in atmosphere service and especially food. I will return again soon and highly recommend!" u'Really a 4.5 and a welcome addition to the Lennox Hill/UES neighborhood. For authentic Japanese food Zawa does not disappoint The homemade cold tofu was delicious. Sashimi was excellent quality with good portions. Definitely worth a visit.' u"This place was an amazing find. One of the best sushi spots I've been to. Great service and atmosphere. GO HERE." u"Great new spot! We ordered Omakase for two and it was delicious. The fish was fresh and flavorful the sushi chef recommended new things that we hadn't tried before and they were great! Really great authentic sushi that's super clean and fresh."],0.8999,0.647,0.353,0.0
61.The Brazen Tavern,[u"I could not be happier with the customer service at Brazen Tavern. Geraldine was FANTASTIC in helping me set up the logistics of my boyfriend's surprise 30th birthday/Halloween party in the upstairs area. She was very responsive to all my emails and questions. She let me decorate the space how I wanted and was also kind enough to make my boyfriend's favorite drink (the Moscow Mule) a drink special for my guests. \n\nOn the day of my party Geraldine was readily available to help out with anything she could from bringing my cake out getting my cake cut and making me and my guests feel welcome. She was available frequently to make sure we were having a great time. Also want to give a shout out to our fantastic bartender Lucas who made great drinks was super quick to serve us was super friendly and let me play my Halloween playlist from my phone. Party planning is stressful but Geraldine and the Brazen Tavern team made everything easy and painless. I had many guests tell me they would like to throw an event there in the future too!\n\nThank you Geraldine Lucas and everyone at Brazen Tavern for all your help in making my event a great success!" u"A fun local Irish pub that is cozy and inviting upon entering. Huge bar seating in the rear left long communal bar tables with no back chairs in the center then standard restaurant tables on the right. \n\nI noticed an upstairs but was happy to stay on the first floor. My party of four grabbed the last table available just off the main entrance.\n\nService was quick and with a lovely smile. Drinks were on point and plenty to choose at that. I think there's more drinks than food on the menu. LOL\n\nMust have The Tavern burger (with bacon it was crispy and smoky) the Bavarian pretzel with dipping cheese and the Guiness. While I didn't sample the crab cakes and salads my buddies ordered they cleaned their plates so I'm going to assume they liked it a lot. \n\nI ordered the Mexican Mule and it needed a little more jalapeno flavor and less lime. But I enjoyed it very much either way.\n\nGreat after work watering hole and fairly priced. We all had such a great time. We grabbed business cards on the way out to share with friends. Am excited to try it again and hopefully to order some more of their  signature dishes." u"Checked out the menu online and it looked really good but I believe its over glorified.  Its really just bar food.  Actually definitely over glorified.  I had the lamb shank special and it looked good but wasn't too tasty.  I bet when drunk its super tasty.  \n\nIf I was in a bar mood I am sure i would love it here.  This isn't really a sit down dinner place.  \n\nI couldn't figure why everyone was yelling to talk haha.  The music wasn't too loud.  Anywho its def a fun spot for drinking!  I am just rating on dinner.\n\nOn another note the waitress was amazing!" u"Came in with a group of five on Sunday evening of the NYC marathon.  We made a reservation well in advance so there was no wait.  I liked the vibe of this place; very busy people of all ages relaxed but with a comfortable amount of noise and energy.  Plenty of TVs for sports lovers.\n\nThe service could not have been friendlier.  The only hiccup was that two of our party's meals were dropped off the original kitchen order.  The manager made up for this delay by comping all drinks and appetizers.\n\nThe food was above average for a pub but otherwise just average.  We ordered a simple burger chicken salmon and the Shepherds Pie.  Prices are also average.\n\nOverall a nice post-theater experience just off the beaten path." u"A solid tavern with great service. I like that the location being just outside the hustle and bustle of Time Square. A little lighter decor that nearly ubiquitous dark taverns and bars that dot the city.\n\nAt first I thought we made a mistake when we got the lamb meatball appetizers. They had the indicative hot spots of being reheated in microwave. They were a bit on the dry side so I would pass on these.\n\nMy chicken under brick main course made me forget all about the sad app. The skin was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The nearly fully de-boned chicken was tender and juicy with a delicious jus that was rich and buttery. I like the jumbled side of brussels sprouts potatoes mushrooms and bacon. Also had the pear and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken addition - it was a generous delicious large bowl.\n\nThe draft options are mostly large scale brewery with a few craft options - probably the way to go. The house rose wine was a bit on the sweet side and forgettable. For dessert you couldn't go wrong with the bread pudding - I liked how the hollowed out the center for a large scoop of ice cream. Not letting anything go to waste they give you the cut outs. Fantastic.\n\nService was great with our waitress checking on us frequently. Even brought us some waters without asking when we finished our 2nd drinks. They have some outdoor seating and a cool little lounge with couches in the back. A 2nd level was closed when we went. \n\nI would return for that fantastic bricked chicken dish!" u"The tacos I had were just OK but I can't speak for any of the other food. The chicken was a bit dry and I was hoping for more flavor. I typically wouldn't order tacos at a tavern but decided against that after seeing their taco specials and seemingly good reviews. My buddy got the brick pressed chicken and said it was great. That's what I'll be getting next time. Atmosphere was great though as was the service. I'd come back if I'm ever in NYC again." u'Cute little bar/ restaurant with delicious burgers! We both ordered the tavern burger and it was top five best burgers. It was cooked perfectly and had great spices and flavors. Also the fries were delicious as well. Reasonable prices and great service make this 5 stars.' u"My husband and I stumbled onto the brazen tavern after we finished watching the Broadway musical Aladdin. We were exhausted and extremely hungry but this place was definitely a perfect fine. As soon as we arrived we were seated very quickly and Sean the drink menu however we both were pretty dead set on getting something to eat as soon as possible.\n\nWe decided on the brazen nachos! Delicious! The waitress was extremely happy when she came back less than five minutes later and asked how is everything and the nachos were all but gone. The drinks were not bad either a little sweeter than I would have liked but not too bad.\n\nI also really like the location of this particular restaurant if you will/bar because it's a little away from all of the hustle and bustle of NY." u'Nope. Called Brazen probably for these prices. Not worth the amount of stars everyone gives it. Had a $32 steak that was SEVERELY overpriced. For that amount it should at least been dry aged. The happy hour is ok. The Margaritas were tasty but watered down. The only authentic thing about this Irish pub was the Irish girls they had working there. I will say the Shepard pie potato skin appetizers were yummy and the atmosphere was clean.' u"We had a great experience here! Sweet attentive wait staff. Great atmosphere. With kind of an interesting music choice but not in a bad way. For an Irish pub they seemed to play a lot of Beyonc\xe9. As for the food we enjoyed everything. Not the best truffle fries I've ever had  but still very good. My friend loved the chicken under a brick. A very cool bar to hang out at and get good food after work. We'll definitely be back !" u"Really like this place. Can't think of one negative thing to say!\n\nLOCATION: theatre district easy to find and near parking garages.\nDECOR: has an old fashioned pub look. Very cute. Not too big but has an upstairs.\nFOOD: for apps we ordered mango habanero wings and spinach dip. Both were good wings especially they had great flavor and cooked perfectly (crispy n juicy). For entree ordered two cheese burgers w fries. Deeeelish. Juicy burgers cooked perfectly good portion of salty/crispy fries.\nDRINKS: ordered Hamilton's Mule Sparkling Pear and Angels Manhattan. The hamilton mule and sparkly pear were amazing! Both had a really nice refreshing flavor.\nSERVICE: excellent. All of the staff were so friendly food and drinks came out so quick. Very pleased.\n\nI will definitely return!" u'We stopped last week for a drink or two and a light snack before a show at the Palace theatre. They had just opened and we were the first into the bar. Our bartender/server Tara was friendly and accommodating while she handled the bar and dining room (the place started to fill up pretty quickly).\n\nWe had the Brazen Nachos and they were very tasty but only lukewarm. Upon mentioning it to the bartender she offered to take them back but we were on a tight schedule. I had a Harpoon Fresh Tracks and a Checker Cab Blonde Ale (about 15 beers on tap. \n\nThe space is inviting and looks like it would be a lot of fun when crowded. You can sit at the bar at one of the many high tops or a booth. The menu looks interesting and I would love to come back - will come back. There is a really nice back room with couches and chairs that looks lik a great place to sit and rest for awhile.' u"So this review is long over due !!...\nI feel compelled to write a review on this place..as how could you not when you stop by there  tens of times and never been disappointed once! \n\nThis place has everything I can ask for as everyday spot where I can relax and have fun at the same time while eating and drinking! \n\nFirst of all what distinguish the Brazen from other similar settings around the area is that the food is fantastic! I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food I tried.. My favorites *at the time* are crab cake flat bread and salmon which changes every time I adventure into new item on the menu lol . Not salty nor greasy but just right! which I find hard to get at most of the bar & restaurants around the area..\n\nAnd more importantly the service is impeccable all aroundfrom the hostess with beautiful smile when you step into the Brazen to welcoming and cheerful bartenders and to the attentive restaurant staffs who bring out your food........and to the any staffs who pass you by for that matter! I grantee they will make you smile for sure :) \nTo sum it all I would say ..casual yet polished with warm friendly service! \n\nJust give it a try and you will see what I am talking about! \nHey if you don't agree with me on any of above after giving it a chance on my account? please find me at the bar hanging lol I will buy you a drink for your trouble ! :)  But I know you will thank me once you do ! \n\nMy name is Stella Kim and I approve this review with all my heart!" u"Last week three friends and I came for some after work drinks. While the HH deal was good ($5 well drinks $6 beers $6 margaritas) the drinks were very weak. My gin and tonics were 80% tonic. I switched over to a Gin mule (not included in the special) and it was delicious. The food was so/so. We had the nachos loaded fries truffle Mac and cheese pretzels and the Irish meatballs. Nothing was amazing but I would definitely get the pretzels and the Mac and cheese again if I were to go back. Those were the two best things.  The best thing about this place was the bar itself. It's so nice inside and there's a ton of room. They have a cute room in the back with couches and a fireplace. The staff was also wonderful. The hostess waitress and the busboy were all super friendly and helpful. I would definitely come back for some full priced drinks another time." u"I went here for Friday happy hour. Great happy hour deals on rack liquor and margaritas. Not crowded excellent music good service. The food was very good as well! The Buffalo chicken spring rolls and Mac and cheese small plates were amazing (although I didn't taste the truffle oil in the Mac and cheese). The fries were very good as well. I would skip the nachos however they were okay but they tasted like they were made with jar pizza sauce instead of salsa. If you're looking for a young fun crowded Friday night bar this isn't it. If you're looking for a laid back good music fairly cheap place to hang out and get some small plates I would definitely recommend!" u"Made reservations for a family dinner at Brazen due to the rave reviews on Yelp for groups.  When we got to the restaurant I laughed and thought I made a horrible mistake because this location was previously home to a few different divey restaurant/bars the past few years (ie. Mighty Quinns Irish Rogue).  We still walked in reluctantly because everyone was hungry and Yelp can't be wrong right? \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that the ambiance and d\xe9cor has improved dramatically since the last time I walked through the doors - it definitely has a more elegant look and feel and the floors were no longer sticky! \n\nThey sat our party of 7 on the hightops along the wall.  The bench along the wall has a really sturdy footrest - it kind of feels like your feet are on a floor.  The high-backed barstools and the table also had a horizontal bar / footrest so the seating was actually very comfortable!  The table was shiny (laminate?) and looked pretty nice. \n\nThe menu is largely American but some items deviate from the norm.  For apps we ordered the nachos and the margherita flatbread.  The flatbread was pretty meh.  The nachos didn't LOOK that amazing but it was delicious.  It wasn't your typical nachos and actually had Shepherd's Pie (probably beef not lamb though) as the main topping.  Highly recommend! \n\nFor entrees I was able to go splitsies on 2 entrees.  For the Steak Frites; The fries were pretty good ; malt vinegar helped to make them more special.  The steak was pretty average; kind of like what you would get at applebees.  It came with Chimichurri sauce under the steak but I thought the Chimichurri was not very flavorful; and kind of too acidic.  However the Chicken under a Brick was phenomenal - the chicken skin was nice and crispy - the meat was tender and juicy - and the potato sprout side accompanied it really well! \n\nDidn't get any dessert from here but I did order a glass of Prosecco.  it was actually one of those mini personal bottles so I felt at $10 that was a steal.  \n\nOVerall I was really pleased.  I think Brazen Tavern is on to something here and I hope they do well." u"Came on Taco Tuesday and loved the $2 taco deals! Go for the beef tacos (I thought the pulled pork ones were a bit dry). Or if you're not feeling tacos try their Signature Tavern Burger! The burger has a unique sweetness along with the saltiness and is definitely a filling amount. We also tried their chips and guac which was nothing special (and the guac was kind of bland in my opinion).\n\nAmbiance-wise the restaurant is extremely cozy with average-to-loud noise levels. It's great for large groups looking to grab a drink after work or just chill and eat.\n\nSHOUT OUT to the foot-rests under the raised benches! I personally hate when my feet are dangling while eating (because I like to lean forward across the table to reach things haha) so the foot-rests were a lovely addition for me!" u"The bar/restaurant was surprisingly good.  When I see a bar I expect mediocre American food.  I knew the reviews were good but once I got there it was very much a sports bar.  The decor of the bar was really nice.  It was clean with a cool old time feel to it.  I was impressed with the decor but I still thought it was just a sports bar.\n\nBut I was wrong.  The food was really good.  We started with nachos and a pizza.  The nachos were made with Shepard's pie and it was awesome.  It was a very different take on nachos.  The pizza was good as well.  For an entree I got the brick chicken.  It was very tasty and I enjoyed my meal.  Some drawbacks are that neither the Nachos nor the chicken was that big.  I was full but I definitely needed both.  My wife got a steak which i thought was a mistake and it was.  It was very average.  I would definitely recommend this place for  superior food in a sports bar setting." u"The pretzels and beer cheese are great combo but not salty. I ordered the truffle mac 'n cheese it was underwhelming. I wouldn't order the mac again. I would consider trying the veggie burger and fries. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Try the pretzels and a cold beer." u"If you need to host a private party and want to deal with a team of true professionals look no further! I can honestly say Geraldine and team made my life 10x's easier while I was trying to pull together a corporate dinner for 100 people. Having done this same dinner over and over in the past I wish I had a Geraldine and Brazen Tavern in every city we travel to make things so easy. \n\nNot only was the service exceptional the food and drinks put a smile on everyone's face. \n\nA huge thank you to the Brazen Tavern from my team to yours!"],0.6239,0.316,0.684,0.0
63.B Side Pizza & Wine Bar,[u"This is a quaint little place in Hell's Kitchen that I never would have discovered had it not been for 2 of my friends who live 2 blocks away and took me here on a Saturday night when I was craving pizza. It truly is an underrated gem. Last month I had a friend visit me from Boston and he previously lived in NYC for 2 whole years and we were celebrating a special occasion so I took him here and he was mind-blown by the food and ambiance. And he was super surprised that in his 2 years of living in NYC he'd never discovered it himself. \n\nThe food is amazing. All of it. Especially the Black Kale Salad (pretty sure it's laced with some sort of rad drug because you just can't get enough). They were also accommodating enough to prepare a vegetarian version of the Killer Bee Pizza which was equally amazing! For dessert one has to get the chocolate boudino because it's truly the stuff of dreams." u"There are thousands of pizza places in NYC but B Side has the Killer Bee Pizza so they win. It's the most popular pizza on the menu for a reason. The honey adds a sweetness to the pizza that plays nicely with the bite of the chili oil. Each pizza is 12 inches and enough for two people to share. \n\nB Side is a popular lunch spot with limited space so keep that in mind when planning a trip out there. The area boasts several cute tucked away restaurants and bistros but B Side was the best food and most comfortable." u"A bit surprised by positive reviews.\n\nThe pizza really had no flavor\nThe seating is uncomfortable and the space too tight\nThe broccolini was so overripe that one couldn't chew it. \nAnd the beers were flat. \n\nLong line and disappointing food makes it a no go for me" u"GREAT PIZZA!  Yes this small dark joint delivers on all fronts. Came here due to the positive yelp reviews and the fact that it was walking distance to SPRINGSTEEN on BROADWAY didn't hurt.  They don't take resv's but we got right in around 6:30 on an October Wednesday.  Tried the Spicoli pizza (which has mushrooms and caramelized onions) and it was amazing. Blistered crust generous toppings. Surprised by the wine selection as the pinot noir and the zin were above average especially at this price point. Served a bit colder than room temperature which was nice. Was tempted by many of the salads but went with the roasted pear which I'd get again.  All in all a very good meal -- and despite being in New York all pizza is not great so if you go here you won't be disappointed." u'If you love Neapolitan style pizza and 90s rock then B Side Pizza is for you!\n\nMy husband and I found them in Yelp while deciding on lunch today and based on the reviews we checked them out.\n\nThe service was very friendly and the pizzas came out within 5 minutes during lunch. The pizza was the right amount of doughy-mess for the crush and thinness for the non-crust (?). \n\nMy husband got the Honey bee which was a phenomenal sweet/salty combo and I got the mushroom/onion pizza which was also flavorful. Again quick service and delicious food. A great stop for lunch or dinner when in NYC.' u'My family went to this restaurant for basic NYC pizza and beer. What is found out was a great place with a slightly different take on the regular pizza and provided us with a great selection of wine and beer. \n\nIf we were not living in DC we would be eating at this little gem at least once a week.  The pizza was great and the wine our host recommended we love so much that will now have in our wine list.' u"This place is perfect to stop in before seeing a show. It's only a few blocks from most of the Broadway theaters is super low key and has delicious pizza\n\nGet the KILLER BEE. It's delicious! Slightly traditional but also pretty unique. The crust is perfectly done in their wood fire oven. \n\nAnd the HOSPITALITY is always on point. Bartenders are always friendly. I remember Mike being super friendly and attentive making it a great experience!\n\nPRICES are pretty reasonable for what you get. But I can nearly eat a whole pizza on my own if I'm pretty hungry. \n\nALL AROUND I'd definitely recommend this place to a friend - I actually already have! A number of times." u"Awesome waitstaff unique drink selections excellent pizza. I loved the meat packing pizza. Also had the broccolini which wasn't to my liking but why did I order vegetables at a pizza place?\nThe pizza was absolutely amazing. Perfect amount of delicious cheese and sauce. Heavy handed on the toppings- YES! Good prices." u'One of the best and lively places I have ever visited..!! Super friendly staff and the service was quick.. our waiter suggested that we get the killer bee pizza.. it was soo tasty that we ordered a second one.. great place to hang out after work' u'My wife and I happened upon this place and decided to give it a try. Needless to say we were both thrilled. We ordered the brocollini appetizer and the Marge pizza. Both were tremendous. The brocollini was immense and delicjous and 4 of people could easily share it. The Marge pizza was fantastic. Savory with just the right amount of toppings. \n\nI definitely recommend this place!' u"We went there for lunch time on weekdays. It was so nice. A chef cooked our salad in front of us(because we had seats at the counter.) after ordering. It was so fresh and delicious. And pizza is also. He made a pizza after that. It was great too. They are little pricy but it's worthy." u"Came here for a work lunch twice and both times didn't disappoint. They have an interesting selection of pizza most of which seem to be creative and well-crafted in its combination of ingredients. My favorite is the killer bee! The black kale salad is also delicious with the incorporation of mint. Aside from food the service is also good :)" u"I LOVE this place. My favorite pizza is the Killer Bee but tbh they're all great. The only down side is that during the summer there is no AC. BUT WHO CARES?! YOU'RE THERE FOR THE AMAZING PIZZA" u'I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve passed this place while walking around Hell\'s Kitchen. The venue is easy to miss since it\'s tucked beneath 9th Avenue and is relatively small and out-of-view. When I first came this place a try with a couple of friends I was excited to discover a new pizza bar in my own backyard! \n\nA friend was the first to arrive and he was seated at the bar. He was told he couldn\'t sit at a table until the rest of us arrived but was fine enjoying a glass of wine. Once we were all together we sat down at a high table and ordered more wine. The menu isn\'t extensive but it has a decent selection of sparkling or non-sparkling wines from the bottle (rose white or red) or tap (white or red) craft beers or bottles and non-alcoholic drinks. I chose the 2013 Rosso Toscano a nice red wine from Tuscany while my friends had beer. One of my friends felt picky so our solve was ordering the "You Got a Lot a\' Balls" pizza: tomato meatballs mozzarella taleggio oregano peppers.  All of us were hungry and service got extra points for short wait time.  The pizza itself was delicious and fills you up quickly with its fluffy not-too-thin crust sauce and meat. Ours aside I noticed the names of the other pizzas were fun as well. For example they have Oscar the Grouch (pinach black kale garlic mozzarella fonduta) and Killer Bee (tomato mozzarella sopressata garlic puree chili oil honey). I\'ve only had the former and Oscar the Grouch and both are clear winners to me. If you\'re trying to be healthy but want a pizza Oscar the Grouch is the pizza for you! On the other hand if you friends want pizza but you want to be healthy you can order their chilled zucchini noodles with grilled chicken (ordered separately - but then you can put the two together). The noodles are delicious and the perfect way to cool down and stay healthy. Otherwise the romantic rustic vibes fast service and delicious food are worth your time for dinner if you\'re not sure where to go and just want some fun comfort food!' u"This review is for my second time coming to this establishment; I can report in short that B Side Pizza Bar did not disappoint!\n\nFood remains extraordinary (I love love their salad options) and the wine selections are superb.\n\nUnderstand that I'm from Suffolk County Long Island. Consequently this review really comes from the heart considering that I hardly get to come to the city as often as I would like much less bother with remembering an establishment that I'll not likely see again. Therefore for me to take the time to write about an establishment (a second time) to which I'll not be coming to all that often simply demonstrates just how great of an experience I had at this place.\n\nAdmittedly I was looking forward to coming to this establishment again to enjoy their varied choice of pizzas which still conquered the second time around. But you know how it is... the greater the expectation the higher the disappointment! Hence I was nervous that I had overbuilt this place in my mind to be more than what it had been the first time I ate here. I can happily report that my concerns melted along with the cheese--I was left beaming and delighted. And as you can imagine their success makes me excited for my next opportunity to come to this area of NYC just to have an excuse to dig-in at this joint once more!\n\nThe Carbonera remains my favorite choice yet we did order other options that were just as great (a meatball with mozzarella and roasted red peppers--YUM)!\n\nAnyhow take my word for it and give this place a try; you'll not regret it--scout's honor! ;-)" u"Wanted to go to b- squared but the kitchen was closed so me and my friends decided to stop by here for some pizza.\n\nWe came in and got seated fairly quickly and got straight into ordering.\n\nWe ordered a variety of appetizers but one that stood out was the kale. I do not like kale at all but this stuff was just so so good. There was no bitter taste that kale usually has and it was surprisingly very flavorful. \n\nWe ordered the killer bee and don pizza and I preferred the don pizza more. It was crispy with the perfect about of cheese and salty prosciutto on top. I gobbled that pizza up. The waitress actually messed up and gave us the wrong pizza (which we didn't even notice) and so we got a free pizza as well! They were all also shaped into hearts for Valentine's Day.\n\nWe also ordered the lasagna which was hearty and a perfect balance to our meal. \n\nOverall the staff was all really kind and accommodating to anything we needed." u'If you are looking for a great pizza you should go there. The place is pretty cool and our waiter was very kind! \nI loved it!' u'Small place with a casual vibe. Not traditional pizza but fantastic! Wood\n fired deliciousness. The burrata with beets was an excellent twist on a sometimes boring standard. I will definitely be back.' u"I'm not a huge pizza lover but this happens to be one of my favorite restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. The crust of the pizza here is so delicious I could probably spend the whole meal just eating crust (and I'm usually the kind of person who doesn't eat the crust). The one down side is that the restaurant is kind of small and we always have to wait a really long time to get a table and they don't take reservations (but really what else is new? It's New York)." u"We got in this place on a Friday night. We were craving for pizza that's why I picked this place on Yelp. Many good reviews and the pizza looks not bad on pics. We ordered two pies of pizza an appetizer 2 glasses of wine. We paid almost 90 dollars. I am not saying the food is bad or the service is not friendly. I just want to say I can do so much better with the 90 dollars. It's just a place offers average food and service at a slight pricy price probably just because of the location."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
7.Havana Central,[u'Late night last minute idea after freezing in Manhattan.  We were hungry and already had friend tell us about this place so we gave it a try.  After a few Pomegranate Mojitos our food showed up and it was great.  We had something different and there were no complaints.\nThe Cuban sampler was the best !  I had a grilled (churrasco meat sampler) with rice and beans.\nPerfect ending to a great night in NYC.' u'They had a "guest appreciation" day where they force you into a 4 course meal. After plying us with a ton of food - which no one can actually eat we were told you can\'t bring anything home. The waiter coerced us into each getting this four course meal as if it were mandatory and then told us they would be throwing all the food away. \n\nThis restaurant gets two stars because despite the theme of the night they did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue and furthermore are a company who believes in the gross waisting of food.' u"Havana Central wasn't horrible but it wasn't amazing either. It seemed half empty but the service was still slow. They took our menus before we ordered a meal just because we got drinks and an appetizer.... and then it took forever to find and wave down the waiter. The plantains and guac tasted great though. Their $18 ultimate pi\xf1a colada that comes in a real pineapple was vastly overpriced - it was just a blended pi\xf1a colada in a stumpy lower half of a pineapple with a long straw .... not really worthy of my Instagram you know? And it was the priciest item on our bill. \n\nAfter we finally ordered the food was decent. I got vegetarian paella and would've preferred a little more seasoning but unfortunately there was no salt or pepper at the table. The good news was I had so MUCH for only $16 - I had tons of leftovers! Once we got the check the waiter was MIA for so long we just went to pay at the front. ......\n\nThe setting was lively but a little run down. They could use some minor renovations. I understand that it was later at night so it wasn't the cleanest. The bussing people were super nice and helped us out a little when the waiters were missing at least. The limited interactions we did have with the waiter were enjoyable - he was funny and lively. It's right by Times Square but there was trash everywhere outside from some festival that went on earlier. \n\nProbably won't come back but it was ok!" u'My Fianc\xe9 & I met with another couple Saturday night for dinner at Havanna Central.  We have been here a few times before and never disappointed.   Our waitress was Sharyssa.   She was FABULOUS!   She was very attentive and made our experience lots of fun!    We ordered the "Table side Sangria."\nSharyssa prepared the Sangria with enthusiasm and had us laughing!   We ordered Chicken & Beef Empanadas which were DELICIOUS!   They were not greasy at all!   We also had Tostones which came out hot and fresh!   We shared a Paella which was also fresh and it was served by the staff.  It was enough for 4 to share as we ate plenty of appetizers!   The ambiance was so much fun!   The band was playing live music and people were up and dancing!   I recommend Havanna Central for a fun and delicious dining experience!' u'Literally love this place for lunch!! They have bomb lunch specials for full plates at 12.95. I like their chicken and cheese empanadas! I always get a passion fruit mojito(with no alcohol). The lunch rush never seems to get the best of them. Have been there 5 times in the last two months and was seated with parties of 4 each time' u"I have never had Cuban food before and I had a friend in town who was craving it. He picked Havana Central. \n\nIt was great food and they had a lot of traditional Cuban food. My only thing if that it's by Time Square so it feels kind of touristy. The drinks were great service was fast and attentive. If you are in that area and looking for a spot to eat I'd recommend it." u"One of my good friends raves about this place and its been bookmarked on Yelp forever. I convinced my mom to try a new spot because she loves eating at the same ole same ole chain restaurants. \n\nTHe place was packed and there were a lot of people waiting for seats however we later learned they were waiting for seats by the bar area. We didnt have to wait for seats in the dining area. Our server wasnt the best he was friendly and professional but just seemed overwhelmed with his tables for the night. The service was really slow so bad that after we finished our mediocre meals I had to go find him to request the check after waiting about 15 minutes. #notcool\n\nNow to those mediocre meals I previously discussed. I ordered the pineapple chicken that came with rice and beans. When I first recieved the plate it didnt look appetizing with two chicken pieces and two slabs of pineapples sitting on top. The worse part was the lack of flavor from the meal. My mom had the vieja ropa that she enjoyed.  It was definitely more tasty than my meal.  \n\nOverall the experience and food wasn't worth the price that is jacked higher because of the location." u"If you can't afford to go to Cuba you can at least drink till you feel in a you're there! The atmosphere at Havana Central makes you feel like your not even in NYC.  From the live Cuban salsa music to the friendly staff you'll really enjoy your visit here. I was lucky enough to arrive for happy hour and had their amazing Cuban mojitos and Cuban Margaritas ($6 each) which were refreshing & worth the price. We also had their Cuban sandwiches  empanadas and chorizo fondue which good. Overall I had a great experience here and can't wait to revisit soon." u'Ok so this place is right in Times Square and close to all the theatre. our theme was Cuba we stopped here first and then hit " On Your Feet".  We were seated right away during a Friday night at 6:30 nice ambiance great decor friendly hostess and waiters. It was lovely with the music.\nHappy hour drinks mojito was to die for!!   virgin pina colada amazing. Tostones rellenos best appetizer ever we will be trying to make these at home.  I had the salmon in mango salsa I hate mango but I gave it a try OMG the best salmon I ever had fish that tastes not like fish and just melt in your mouth with all the seasonings of sweet and salty. We were soo full and had to go for the show. We had to skip dessert but it looked amazing!\nChurros and tres leches! We will be back!!' u"Came here craving Spanish food with my boyfriend and we had a good experience. The empanadas were good we had the chicken and beef and accidentally gave us a cheese instead of chicken one. The cheese one was gross but the other two were definitely flavorful. Usually the empanadas we get at a Spanish place are dry but this actually wasn't so we were impressed. We shared the pollo al ajillo which was chicken in garlic sauce and a side of rice and beans. I was looking forward to yellow rice but it was actually not so I was a little upset but my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot. I give it a 3 because it was average food I wasn't wowed but my boyfriend definitely liked it. I think it's a place to try if you're around Times Square and are craving Spanish food. We didn't get a chance to try any drinks but I'm sure they're good!" u'Must admit that coming here reminded me of being in Cuba. for a moment or for the time my husband and i were there we forgot we were in the heart of NYC time square and we thought we were back in Cuba. we came here to celebrate our 4 year anniversary and it was great for the most part. There was a live band playing come great salsa music for the atmosphere i would give it more stars but what bought my rating down was the slow service and the food. i was not such a big fan of the flavor of the food it was pretty bland and basic in my opinion and although the server was very friendly and everyone else was friendly too food and drinks too for ever to come. on the bright side the classic mojito has to be one of the best mojitos ive had that are the closets in flavor to the actual Cuban mojitos. Over all this was an ok place in terms of food but a full star for drinks and the atmosphere.' u"Food was great!\nService not so much. \nIt's just off Times Square si it's very convenient and the ambiance is great. Perfect amount of food." u'Fabulous drinks and food. Once we actually got a server attitude about the place improved. With drinks and full dinner look to spend some money.  Great for a special night out.' u'Good service good atmosphere. The food was similar to what I had in good Miami Cuban restaurants. I like empanadas and was not disappointed. The avocado salad was fresh and crispy. Arroz con marisco delicious as well as the picadillo. The black bean sauce was the icing on the cake. The dessert consisting of choros tres leches and flan was average. \n\nWent again by the end of the week by a request from my family.. it was good too' u"I  NYC eats!   Thanks to yelp reviews we hit the perfect spots during our 24 hour visit to NYC.\n\nWe had to synchronize our activities to meet each of our timed appointments including our dinner reservation.  Not familiar with Times Square we used the map app to find our way around the Times Square area. We were so excited to find this restaurant located just around the corner from our hotel.\n\nWe had an amazing table on the second level overlooking the entire first level.  Yes it's probably a tourist spot in the heart of Times Square but the service and food were spot on great!  \n\nWe chowed down on the empanadas sampler the calamari and the plantain chips!  Get the plantain chips because you will want more!  The portion was plenty enough for a takeout bag!  I enjoyed that bag when I got home. My sister and I ordered some amazing Arroz con Chicken and Shrimp(2 seperate dishes). Again large portions that we actually took home! The flavor was awesome and the chicken and shrimp filled the plates.  They offer a nice kids menu and my little niece ordered flank steak and Cuban rice.  \n\nService was awesome!  The staff always checked on us and provided various hot sauces upon request. Make a reservation and enjoy a cool drink and awesome food right in the center of Times Square!" u'Love this place. Come here every once in a while with my coworkers for happy hour. Great drinks service and appetizers.\nWe always sit at the bar I get the sangria and the boys always get mojitos or margaritas. And lets not forget the tequila shots.\nWe ordered the cheese empanadas shrimp empanadas and plantains with beans. Everything was yummy.\nOur bartender Brandon was awesome!!' u'I will make this quick for all the fans lol. But this is over price Cuban food go to west New York and for find many more better then this but go ahead and spend the money if you like.' u"I wouldn't of stepped into here ever since it's such a random spot in Times Square. But we yelped this place and actually saw the food looked decent.\n\nI called in and the asked for the wait and was told possibly an hour but walked right in and was seated right away!\n\nThere was a couple people dancing in the waiting area and a band playing very good music. \n\nWe decided to try the appetizer sampler and crispy beef platter and plantain chips with guac.\n\nEverything was really good and hit the spot! The small servings in the appetizers were perfect for 2-3 people! I'd say get this forsure! Then order some real food." u'OMG!!!  An oasis of tropical bliss in the Concrete Jungle!  Stop thinking just go in and have a meal already!  Completely teleport your tastebuds and eardrums with the live music to a place where your cares melt away!\n\nPS:  Ask for Rafael:  he will take great care of you!' u'I chose this spot to celebrate my birthday. I made a reservation and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The food was great! I ordered ropa vieja a classic Cuban dish absolutely superb! Being from Miami I was impressed. The drinks are awesome! Strong and NOT watered down try the mojito and the caipirinha best drinks outside of Brazil and Miami. Ivan is the best server EVER!!!! He is sure to make you feel welcome and have a good time. Definitely recommend this place when visiting NYC.'],0.6369,0.51,0.49,0.0
65.B Squared,[u"This place was the first restaurant my family ate at in New York City. We found this awesome little place after walking around restaurant row. \n\nThey service was excellent and the food was exquisite. I ordered the lamb bolognese my girlfriend ordered the Mac n cheese my mom ordered some antipasto and my grandma...can't remember exactly. Anyways the lamb bolognese was amazing. It was rich and the lamb gave it a nice unique flavor. The Mac n cheese had some broccolini and peas in it and it made it different as well. The Mac n cheese had a delicious crust on too as well. \n\nThis was a great Italian food place to go to!" u"Came here randomly on a Friday night Hell's Kitchen adventure.\nAll good nights end in pizza right?\nThe pizza was delicious and the chicken parm was spectacular some of the best I've ever had!" u"I teetered between 3 and 4 stars for B Squared.  It's a 3.5 star joint.\n\nPros:  Pizzas are pretty good - not out of this world good but usually very good and enjoyable.  I've not disliked any slice I had here.  Drinks are pretty good too.\n\nCons:  Often crowded and loud and a little pricey for what it is.  It's juuuust enough to stop me from giving the full 4 stars.  I'll probably be back at some point." u'Down and dirty quickie...\nNice hip ambience with nice selection of draft craft beers and full bar...oh and some wines on draft as well! Fun stuff...and the food was good also. We liked it and would love to return to perhaps try their "Mac and Cheese" and a different flavored pie. I had the Meat Packer (stop snickering) which was good but I would order it well done next time. That said I would like to try their Carbonara pie upon my return.' u"We came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. It was maybe around 9:30ish and this seemed like a good night choice in Hell's Kitchen. We were seated promptly and attended to quite rapidly. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine and my friends ordered the eggplant parma and a pepperoni pizza respectfully. I was a little disappointed by my pasta. It was kinda small and for the price point  ($18) wasn't anything special. However my friend's pizza was absolutely delicious! Moral of the story if you come here: order a pizza." u"Sister restaurant of B Side (which isn't too far away) but I actually prefer B Squared after dining at both. Not only is it more spacious I think the menu at B Squared is more elaborate. \n\nWe shared the Black and White pie (garlic and cauliflower pur\xe9e black truffle truffle oil and shallots) along with the Meatpacking pie (sopressata pancetta speck bacon sausage and mozzarella). The Meatpacking was amazing - it really lives up to its name as there was plenty of meat. Seriously there was no shortage of any of the ingredients listed. It overflowed so much that the toppings just kept falling off with each bite! Great that none of what would be considered heavy meat products overpowered each other either. Literally could have inhaled and devoured this pie myself. \n\nThe Black and White was interesting and good - nothing I've really had before. This was my friend's favorite. I can't really describe it as it didn't taste like a pure white pie (although it looked like just a white pie) - you'll have to order it and try it yourself. Disappointing that the pie was suppose to have truffle and truffle oil but I didn't see or taste any of the two. Nonetheless great great pies so I'll be back." u"4 strong stars for some of the best pizza I've had! \n\nI was hoping for a little more in the wine and drink offerings but oh man that pizza! Additionally the appetizers we shared were just good if not for these two average points I would be shelling out 5 stars for the pizza we excitedly enjoyed.\n\nMy love and I stopped in for dinner before a show. After much pizza deliberation we had narrowed it down to two choices and asked our waiter to recommend between those options...the result: Black & White Pizzza! This neapolitan style pizza consisted of garlic & cauliflower puree black truffle shallots parsley truffle oil sherry vinaigrette parmesan robiola. Garlic and truffle?...I love. Add some shallots?...for sure. But sherry vinaigrette?...wouldn't have been on my radar but it was perfect with the other ingredients and made for a memorable experience. There are a ton of great restaurant in NYC but if I am in town for more than a couple days I think I would need to stop by B Squared for this pizza...it was that memorable!" u"Pizza was on our mind so we came here as we had passed by it a couple of days prior on our way home. He got a beer (of course) and I opted for this mixed wine...I wasn't a fan. It wasn't horrible but mixing merlot and I forget what other two red wines were involved just seemed to muddy it up. Asking what the most popular pizza dish was and were directed to the honey bee pizza which we had our eye on anyway since it seemed so different from other pizza places. It wasn't as spicy as I had hoped it would be but the honey taste wasn't overwhelming. I normally don't like sweet mixing with my savory but I didn't mind it. The pizza came out quickly hot and a little charred just the way I like it." u"Each time that I dine here I am never disappointed. My most recent experience was Saturday night. We decided to dine at the bar. The bartender was super nice and the service was good. With good food and good service you can't go wrong. Sometimes the wait can be pretty long depending on the day and time and the size of your party but it is worth it. Luckily the place was not packed for dinner which was surprising. You can't go wrong with any pizzas here. If you like thin crust pizzas then yeah you'll enjoy their pizzas. I have tried almost all of them but my favorites are (in this order) the Carbonara the Meat Packing and the Becky. They can be a bit messy but it's what makes their pizzas yummy. The must try apps are the meat balls and the brussels sprouts. Go and try this place out if you haven't already!" u"I was a little nervous to order the Carbonara again so I had the Lamb Bolognese instead. It was just a tad salty for my palate but it still had a great flavor! Portions are on the smaller side so I was slightly hungry afterwards. I did want to try the desserts but maybe another time.\n\nService again was great and the bartenders/customers/waiters seemed to know everyone around them and it was such a happy crowd which made the dining experience far more enjoyable.\n\nI'm glad to have given this place another shot and it's almost becoming my go-to spot/ recommendation when I or my friends are in the neighborhood looking for a nice Italian spot." u"Great stop - was looking for pizza in the area and didn't want to do the grab and go so after a quick Yelp search we found this spot and stopped in.  \n\nVery nice inside not very crowded when we arrived just after 10PM this past Friday.  Although there were just 2 of us we went for 2 pies the Marge (essentially a Margherita) and the Killer Bee.  Although it seemed like an unusual combo of ingredients for a pizza we trusted in our server's strong recommendation and the many Yelp reviews that specifically mentioned this pizza.  \n\nFood was out quick and had that great wood fired look to it - hot and bubbling cheese and sauce with a nice char on the crust. \n\nI went right for the Killer Bee as I needed to see how Sopressata garlic chili and honey tasted on a pizza.  Definitely a winner - I don't know why it works it just does.  The pizza was cooked perfectly thin on the bottom but enough support to pick up and eat by hand.  I tried the Marge which was very good as well but just kept going back to the Killer Bee.  We ate well after we were already full and nearly polished off both pies making sure to pick and eat all the toppings off the two slices we couldn't get down. \n\nGreat selection of craft beer on draft as well - I had a brown ale that was new to me (can't remember the name).   Our server was excellent warm friendly and always checking up to see if we needed anything.  \n\nI will definitely be back - there were a several other very delicious sounding pizzas I want to try!" u'Definitely had high hopes for this place based upon recommendation ... HOWEVER:\n\nCame here for happy hour and sat at the bar. Food was okay (We had the meatball sliders arugula salad and the "Oscar the Grouch" pizza) but wouldn\'t say it was anything to write home about. \n\nThe mediocre food was something I could get over at this point  ... BUT THE SERVICE - NO WAY!\n\nThe bartender had no interest in making sure we had a memorable experience. She was so consumed in the cliental sitting at the bar next to us that our drinks were basically empty the entire time we were there. Just when we thought we could flag her down for a drink refill on our cocktails she was standing off to the end of the bar chit-chatting with the other two girls working with her. Was this a good experience? NO. Will I come back here? ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nOnly giving this place two stars because the man who brought our food out to the bar was so polite and sweet. Besides that this place was underwhelming at best.' u'Great find while walking on the west side.  The Oscar the Grouch with Kale and Spinach was fantastic!!' u'I enjoyed the Marge pizza too some time coming based on the Fact it was a Friday but a nice location  and pleasant service why not check it out' u"On my recent trip to New York I wanted to stop and get some pizza somewhere close to my hotel. Based on the reviews on yelp I decided to check out B Squared. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the 'lotsa balls' pizza. It had a great crust and the toppings were delicious. I also had a couple of beers while I was here. I would certainly recommend this restaurant. Was it my favorite pizza in the world? No but I would put it in my top 10 list. Give it a try you won't be sorry." u'My sister and I were blown away by a vegetarian dish she ordered with squash. My pizza was also unique and delicious. We loved this restaurant. We will never forget that squash pasta dish..... Thank you for a great experience!' u"Such a good pizza place if you're in the mood for fancier pizza than your $1 chain down the street! Me and my friend shared a pie although we both weren't that hungry... the slices are pretty small and if I had my normal appetite I probably would have need to order more (maybe a whole pie to myself? For $16?!)\n\nNot too crowded at 7pm on a Monday night but definitely enough people for you to confirm that other people also like this place." u"Went to B Squared with a friend from out of town.  Contrary to the several other reviews I found very little about the restaurant to want me to return.  One the service was extremely slow.  I am not just referring to the time between when we ordered our entrees but I am referring to the bar service.  We were seated at the bar and my friend and I were just drinking draft beers before eating our dinner.  The bartender was totally disorganized and it took a really long time to get served both our first and our second pints.  Let me reiterate again...we were seated at the bar and ordered draft beers!  I could understand if we were ordering mixed drinks and not seated right at the bar but that was not the case.\nNonetheless when the food did arrive we dug in.  We split an entree of lasagna and had a small pie together.  The lasagna was just ok as it was a bit bland but overall wasn't too bad.  The pizza was however quite disappointing.  Frankly it tasted like it was frozen pizza and not freshly made.  I hate to be so down on a place but after reading so many positive reviews I had a completely opposite experience due to the poor service and mediocre food." u'Great pizza spotty service.\n\nBeen to its sister location a litter further north. Menu is pretty much the same but I do appreciate that this B Squared location offers more variety of pasta. Both the pastas are small in portion size but delicious nonetheless.' u'This review is from the depths of my foggy memory after a night of drinking and socializing with some friends we hadn\'t seen in ages. \n\nWe were still in the mood for "sweet" nosh and hanging so we stopped in for dessert and drinks. We ordered one of every thing off the dessert menu because we don\'t do anything half-assed. \n\nSeems like every thing was solid and no one spit anything on the floor proclaiming "we\'re never coming here again!" There was a pizza thing that was nearly devoured by one in our party. So I know that thing went over well. And every one liked their beers. \n\nThe crowd was lively and welcoming. The staff was quick to get us a spot as soon as one was available. Eight thumbs up!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
97.District Tap House,[u"My sister and I had a great experience at the District Tap House last night and would definitely come back. Decided to meet up at a halfway point between where we worked and my sister randomly found this place on google. It was so close to Penn Station which turned out to be super convenient for me. The place was really busy on a Monday around 7:45 I'm assuming it was mainly because of the Yankees playoff game. I was in my nursing scrubs and didn't feel out of place at all. You can be casual in this place or you can dress up anything goes. I couldn't find a seat at the bar which was a bummer because I prefer dining/drinking at the bar instead of a table. However there was a seat available at the high top window table and so I hung out there for a bit while I waited for my sister. After interacting with the less than friendly bartender I was glad we chose to sit somewhere besides the bar Mr. Grumpy. \n\nI ordered a glass of sparkling Rose which was $13 a little steep for a glass but it was good and I was really impressed with their list of sparkling wines by the glass. Rarely do you see more than one listed on a menu and considering this was a tap house having five different glasses of bubbles to choose from was amazing. Some glasses more expensive than others but there really was something for everyone. We didn't drink beer but if you enjoy beer this is the place to come their list went on and on and on. The hosts were great they were able to seat us at a table near the front of the restaurant within minutes. The tables are close together so it's easy to hear what the table next to you is saying and even easier to help yourself to their plate of fries when they're not looking. I'M JOKING. But its close quarters. Their menu looked good was hoping there was an add protein option to their salads. Their entrees were tiny in my opinion but delicious and also priced well according to their portion size. You can order a quality dish and not pay $32 for it. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which looked and tasted different than any dip we had had in the past sort of a pesto vibe going on delicious. My sister ordered their salmon dish served with haricot vert and I went with their quinoa salad. (Again was hoping there was an add chicken button to that or something) \n\nOur server was phenomenal personality wise. He didn't have much help when it came to clearing empty glasses plates and refilling waters so he was doing everything on his own and did a great job. When ordering the salmon he asked how my sister wanted it cooked and she looked at me because she didn't have a clue. I ordered it medium rare as that's how I've always ordered it in restaurants and how we have usually cooked salmon in restaurants I have worked in. Medium rare from my knowledge is warm red. Our server asked how we wanted the food to come out we said whenever and it all came out together which was great. It's a Monday night after work we're not interested in coursing our food out we'll take all the food. So my sister cuts into her salmon eek. It was sushi. I'm not exaggerating it was cool red sushi in the inside light sear on the outside. She of course did not want me to say anything and I of course said something because I wanted her to enjoy her meal it's a rare occasion the two of us get together like this. When I showed the salmon to our server he agreed it was most definitely not medium rare. He insisted on bringing it back to the kitchen and brought out a brand new piece of salmon cooked to perfection and tasted incredible. He couldn't have been more accommodating and understanding and really gave stellar service throughout our entire experience. \n\nI loved my quinoa salad so delicious. The pomegranate seeds were an awesome addition to the salad gave it a really good crunch. There was loads of quinoa butternut squash in there arugula feta cheese that came in little blocks and a fig balsamic dressing. I thought it was seasoned and dressed perfectly and was an awesome portion for $10! We paired our meals with some white and red wine their Malbec was delicious. The restaurant itself was really cool super long bar tons of televisions TONS and a huge screen in the back with a family style table and additional seating. The salmon mishap wasn't even a problem because of how well it was handled by our server and the management. Looking forward to coming back here thanks for the great service I didn't catch the guys name but thanks!" u"Tucked away slightly outside Times Square you'll find this sports bar. This place is not your average sports bar but it is pretty nice. They have quite a few TVs to watch NFL games. Game Day Special for drinks is 5 cans for $30 (not being from NYC I wouldn't consider this a deal but I guess it is around here). \n\nThey have a good variety on the menu and a special game day menu featuring wings and short ribs. We started with the goat cheese croquettes which were very delicious & flavorful but quite a disappointing portion size for the cost. For my meal I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich which was pretty good the chicken was slightly dry to me but the other toppings helped with that. My colleague had the short rib sandwich & said it was good! \n\nOverall not a bad place to come have a beer some food and watch the game! I'd come back!" u"Hip fun crowd. Loud as heck inside. Place isn't that big but they have a bar inside on the right and another in the back. Communal seating but have to be seated by host. \nDrinks were a bit pricey and it didn't seem as though there were any HH deals. \nOrdered 3 beers and had two apps (Croque Monsieur Sliders - basically mini ham and cheese warm sandwiches. Be careful as the sauce will squirt out if you're not prepared & Spinach & Artichoke Dip - they're take on a classic. It was in essence a pureed version that was sparkling when it came out...you'll know what I mean when you order it...also they give you like 6 pita chips which are amazing but seriously give me more). I wouldn't order those next time. Not enough to feed one let alone 2. And with a $12 price tag. \nBeer list is impressive (50 in tap 57 bottle and 34 cans). Craft to basics. $8 or more.. pricey but it's NYC. \nService was good. As mentioned before it's loud in there but there are plenty of TV's to watch a game. \nI would return to try some of their entrees but I am in no rush..." u'Needed a place to watch the Yankee\'s game and Googled "best Happy Hour in Midtown" which is how I stumbled upon District and I am so glad I did. We happen to show up around the start of HH but stayed well through that for the game. The atmosphere was upbeat and classy at the same time and was comfortable even when it became packed. We tried the tuna tartare and each had a District burger. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the burger because I felt it was too dry but the tuna was delicious. They have a huge beer menu so go in and have fun trying different craft beers. \n\nNote: We sat at the bar and the bartenders were on it; well actually we started with a female bartender with dark have and we loved her! She was very attentive and never dropped the ball. When the crowd grew a couple more bartenders came in and we ended up with another woman that wasn\'t as good.' u"We stoped by The Tap House before going to MSG Rangers game for a couple of drinks and some food . The hostess was really sweet  we've been seated right away even though the table was reserved for a later time : but we will have like an hour and a half before that: Great! Enough time to eat ! They have happy hour 4-7.  bud light was $4 they also had other happy hour drinks and wine . The food was pricey and portions were really tiny like tapas size we were a little disappointed :( we've ordered dates wrapped in bacon( $6) it was good; French fries( we've tried better)  grilled calamari ($12) and spinach artichoke dip( too oily ) with pita bread . The service was good . I don't think we will go back  may be if portions will be bigger for the price! \nInside there are a lot of TV's : do you can watch any game you want : football hockey. You name it" u"Back in NYC so I had to visit one of the best selection of draft beers at District Tap House!\n\nQuiet Wednesday night but the 10 tv's showing baseball games and music helped keep my night going....\n\nI wrote a negative review back in 2014 or so based on one bad employee. Now after having two great experiences I wish I could delete my first review. Troy might not be as cute as Lauren but he was very attentive to all his customers! Troy helped me put together a couple different flights of draft trying beers I don't have on the West Coast. Troy introduced me to his General Manager (Steven I believe). Passed an hour or so bs'ing with the two of them.  They both agreed there is no employee at District Tap anymore who would offer the negative service I saw on my first time there.\n\nPHENOMENAL Customer Service!\nAWESOME Beer Selection!\nCHILL Vibe!\nGREAT for watching sporting events!\nAMPLE room!\n\nThanks again to Troy and his manager for the great customer service! They even both apologized for my 2014 negative experience!\n\nKeep up the good work!" u"Ive found most good beer bars have average food and great food places have pedestrian beers not worthy of their food. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive and here at District Tap they aren't. \n\nDTH has about 50 quality taps that rotate as needed. It's obvious they take pride in serving fresh beer. Included are local brews as well as regional crafts in addition to 7 Belgian ales. \n\nTough decision deciding what beer to get and equally tough deciding on what food to order. Their menu had quite a few items I wanted to try including the grilled octopus and branzino ceviche but they'll have to wait till next time. All items were small plate so that afforded me the opportunity to order 2 things. I got the grilled tuna with wasabi caviar and basil and the grilled chicken with baby potatoes and maitake mushrooms. Both were moist and delicious. Incredibly good especially for a beer joint. \n\nNo negatives here. Our waiter knew his beer and food and was very cordial to the 3 of us despite that we told him we weren't ready to order 4 times and made him return (too much catching up to do). The hostess was awesome too. \n\nEven if (God forbid) you don't like beer you need to dine here anyway. Looking to return." u"On a recent trip to the city for a show we were meeting a friend in the area.  She knows we love craft beer & recommended DTH from the ratings.  Excellent choice!\n\nWe arrived fairly early to a pretty empty bar & the delightful hostess was more than happy to seat us even though only 2 of 3 were present.  An extremely personable waiter came by with the beer & food menus.  Between the fantastic beer selections & the food selections this was going to take awhile to decide!\n\nWith our party all seated we ordered a few beers & started catching up.  It had been a 2 year or so hiatus since we last saw our friend.  Our waiter was quite understanding & never rushed at at all.  This dishes are all small plate so you can try a couple.  I ordered the brussel sprouts with apple & pistachio & they were incredible.  In fact everything on the menu looked great!\n\nI have to say as a craft beer LOVER I find most places with really good beer have mediocre food.  It's a rarity to find a place with both good food & beer.  DTH is that place.  By the crowd in the bar when we eventually left word is out.  \n\nThis was a 5 star experience all the way & I can looking forward to returning.  Highly recommend." u"Yelp comes to the rescue again. Nearing early evening on a Friday three of us found ourselves in Midtown wanting a pub with good food. District Tap House seemed to fit the bill. The only unknown was whether we could get seats.\n\nAs it happened while it was quite crowded we scored a great booth near the back. Fortune was on our side.\n\nAnd it continued. DTH not only has an extensive beer list but a solid menu worthy of a gastropub label (which it does not have on Yelp for some reason).\n\nI don't recall the beers but I do recall I had no trouble with selecting one (two). \n\nFood. We were mostly in appetizer mode:\n- Spicy mixed nuts at first seemed overly sweetened but they grew on us and ended up being demolished.\n- Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. A lot of places have roasted brussels sprouts these days but DTH's added cauliflower is a nice touch. Very good.\n- Mac and Cheese. Lots of raves for the M&C and well-deserved. It's also quite good.\n- Tomato soup. A well-balanced version of this popular soup.\n- Tuna tartar. Their version of tuna tartare. I did not sample but a taste and it works. The person who ordered it gave it a thumbs up.\n\nAmbiance seems like 'sports bar' what with the million TV screens but DTH is more than that. They even have a cozy whiskey bar in the back.\n\nRecommended." u'One of the best places to come and watch the game. This deceptively small looking bar from the outside is huge on the inside. It probably goes pretty deep into the block. The bar has TVs lining the walls from the front to the back. The booths in the back even have small TV per booth. \n\nWe were able to make it to happy hour. They had two of their signature cocktails for happy hour prices. They also have one of the biggest beer selections I have seen. Almost needs a magnifying glass to read them.\n\nThe food was pretty good though on the small size. We got the crab empandas duck fat fries brussel sprouts and the goat cheese and prosucitto flatbread. The flatbread was the only one that kinda feel flat. The bread was soggy but it still tasted okay.\n\nAll in all it was a great experience. Perfect for game days.' u"My husband: The birthday party is at a sports bar.\nMe: Oh. Great?\n::looks at menu::\nMe: Okay I'm intrigued.\n\nAfter coming here for a late lunch gathering I'm sold.  This is legit delicious food.  There are plenty of TVs to cover whatever event you want to watch and there's a large and varied selection of beer. Since I was uninterested in both of those things (I gave up football a few years ago) it was the food that won me over.  We ordered a bunch of dishes including the octopus wings and fritters and they were all really good. The octopus was actually hands down fantastic. More surprising was that everything was reasonably priced. \n\nI would absolutely come here again." u"Had dinner here with a colleague. Varied menu that looks great but lacked a little in flavor. Place was crowded and very loud. Huge beer list but my complained about how expensive the whisky was. I won't be back." u"A friend and I came to this restaurant around 3:30 on a Saturday. It was slow inside and there were plenty of tables available. The hostess was completely rude however and treated us like we were bothering her and they didn't have room for us. She actually told us that we needed to leave in an hour because she had reservations. Ok my friend and I looked at each other and commented on how we would hurry so we could accommodate the restaurant's busy schedule. (whatever)\n\nShe went to put us at a two top in between two other parties that where each using the space we would have been sitting in. I asked if we could have a table that was a little bigger and offered more space since I am six feet tall and not the size of a normal person. The hostess rolled her eyes and clearly said no then stuttered and told us again that she had reservations coming in and would need those tables. I get it I worked in the restaurant business but just her tone and attitude was a turn off. We decided to sit at the bar instead. At this point we were already turn-off by the lack of hospitality you would normally get from a restaurant but we had been walking for a long time and didn't want to go back out in the cold to find another place.\n\nThe bartender was nice but we had to ask for a food menu several times. Now remember it wasn't very busy.  \n\nWe both ordered a hamburger and fries and the food was delicious. He kept our drinks full and asked how everything was. When it came time to get our check we asked and waved him down. It took forever to get the check and pay. In the end it was a so-so experience." u"Came here for lunch. The food is OK. I didn't get to try the beer but they have a lot of choices. The Burger has a nice smokey taste almost as if it's been cooked on a charcoal grill. The pork sandwich is cooked nice but was a little bland. The fries are awesome. Nice and crisp and well seasoned. Frying them in duck fat makes all the difference." u'Came here for a birthday dinner with a friend last year. Staff was nice we got a table and enjoyed our food.  I liked that they had a lot of healthier options that were more than a salad.  Only complaint was that it was LOUD.  But it was after work in midtown so just know before you go :) AND make a reservation it got pretty crowded.' u"Midwestern gal: great ambiance and beer list.  The food was very subpar and overpriced. I understand its tapas but the portions for the price was just not great. The food wasn't that flavorful. If you are looking for a great beer list this is your place! I would highly recommend the beer menu.\n\nMidwestern guy: Beer selection - 5 stars. Ambiance - 5 stars. Food - 2 stars. This place is a great location to grab a few drinks with some close friends and share an appetizer. The drink menu is very large and they had some specialty craft beers that I have not seen anywhere else in the city yet! I would not recommend getting food here as the portions are small prices are high and the taste is mediocre." u'After having a great time at ripleys believe it or not! We felt the belly rumbling and decided to try a Radom place with the help of yelp!! We had the short rib lamb sliders and fried Brussels sprout. My favorite was the lamb slider with its spicy touch. My partner enjoyed the braised short rib because of its hint of horseradish. Our server was extremely helpful in what to order and overall we enjoyed our dining time in this vintage establishment.' u"The District Tap house is a great bar in the crappy part of midtown. I first went with my best friend on a Friday night. We were worried because it was definitely packed but the hostess was lovely and was able to get us a booth in the back. A third friend of ours ended up meeting us there and we spent about three hours trying their drinks and menu. The drinks were fairly priced and we weren't rushed out of our booth. Overall a great night. \n\nMore recently I love going there for lunch. The bartender there now a blonde lady isn't the most attentive but once you've got her attention she's good to you. The Chili Margarita is to die for and the salmon burger gets better every time. The first time I tried it a few months ago it kind of fell apart but now it's perfect. If you're ever in the neighborhood this is great for a quick bite. Your burger is ready in 10 minutes and the long list of drinks (beer cocktails you name it) to choose from is to die for. Definitely a place to visit." u'So much to do and see during our first trip to NYC. Being a Sunday in October we opted to take a breather and check in on our Detroit Lions (vs. MIN). \n\nI contacted the Tap House and confirmed they had the NFL Sunday Ticket/ Gamepass and the Lions game would be available. Upon arrival (1pm~game time) we were greeted by a friendly hostess who referenced her "game cheat sheet." The Lions game was not yet requested or showing on any of the TV\'s so she switched on the first table near the bar. The TV was within immediate viewing of our 4-top and one other as well as bar stools behind us.\n\n1st QTR: We started with the Weekend Football Special Wings (6) Charred Pomegranate and (6) Chipotle as well as the regular menu item Crab Empanadas. Side note: the executive chef doesn\'t believe in offering Ranch or Bleu Cheese dressing...at all. Just NA. Maybe a New York thing? The wings were good. The Crab Empanadas not so good.\n*The server failed to bring my husband his coke while we ate the apps. \n\n2nd QTR: we continued by ordering the Crispy Brussel Sprouts from what appeared to be a new server? The Sprouts were hot and crispy with good flavor. \n\nAfter enjoying some food football and beer we said good-bye at half-time (full bellies and freezing cold temps in bar).\n\nOverall a nice option for sports fans especially in this neighborhood. The food was good not great not bad. Extensive beer list. Actually had what we ordered (not always the case).' u"Five stars purely for their phenomenal beer selection. This place is truly was craft beer dreams are made of. I came here late on a Thursday night after seeing Wicked and while their were plenty of people still out we had no problem securing a table right away. Our waitress was great and gave us some good beer and drink recommendations. I wasn't crazy hungry but I did order the mac n cheese to munch on which was alright but nothing to write home about. However I wont let the lackluster grub take away any stars because they excel in their namesake and honestly that's what maters most."],0.7184,0.231,0.769,0.0
120.The Smith,[u"This place was amazing! I called as we were walking over and they told us the next reservation wasn't for 3 more hours but the wait time was 30 min. We grabbed two seats at the bar (there were 3 of us) and got drinks while we waited. The man next to us left so we took his seat and ended up staying at the bar. \nThey were SO busy so service was slow but the 3 guys behind the bar weee very friendly and accommodating. \nWe started with 2 mimosas and a Bellini- yum! \nWe got 6 oysters to share and were given all the condiments  I love when they do that so you can try an assortment.  The bread we got was excellent too. \nFor brunch my mom got the caramel pancakes- oh my goodness yum! \nI had the smoked salmon Benedict which was amazing as well.  The home fries were literally the best I have ever had. I was so full but ate every bit of food on my plate.   My sister loved her smoked salmon toast as well. \n\nWe joked that we were going back to NYC and were just going to sit at Smiths all day.  A new favorite!" u'...we definitely should have made a reservation.  No idea the place would be so crowded on a Wednesday night.  We had a party of three and ended up sitting at the community table to keep from waiting an hour for a table.  \n\nAtmosphere:\nVery trendy place but so loud.  Towards the middle of the night all the sounds started melding and I was just ready to get out of there.  \n\nDrink:\nThe purified tap and sparkling water on the table was great for me.  My fiance kept having to track down the server for refills on his soda and the other party had a large beer and switched to water.\n\nFood:\nThe portions are huge!  We are here on business and staying in a hotel so we were unable to take anything home.  We all ended up leaving about half of our dinner on the plate.  I had the braised short rib pasta and the other two had the Wednesday night chicken special (chicken and waffle type dish).  I would have loved more cheese on the pasta.  The chicken special had a really good coating and cooked well.  The waffle was made of potato or rice...something weird.   We were not fans.  There was a side of brusselsprouts ordered and those were very tasty.' u"Great variety of food - seafood steak appetizers salads.. variety of different types of cocktails beer and wine\nSplit shisito peppers tuna poke short rib cavatelli and shrimp scampi with jalape\xf1o cheddar grits - loved the grits and cavatelli\nBusy/loud ambience.. tables are very close together we had to move them to get in and out\nI found the host and bartender very friendly but the waiter was not very friendly and I felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant. It was a busy night but the waiter could've at least made sure we didn't want anything else. \nI would go back to try more options on the menu and the steak." u'Pluses include:\n\n- Dope looking place (they must have poured serious coin into this joint)\n\n- Complimentary still AND sparkling water bottles with "endless" refills (which would be cool if the sparkling didn\'t turn flat so quickly)\n\n- Complimentary bread and butter (butter is solid bread would be good if it wasn\'t 7-seconds away from being completely stale)\n\n- The mac & cheese is as advertised and reported by fellow Yelpers and generously portioned\n\nQuasi-negatives include:\n\n- The tomato soup with cheese melt was overly salty and the "French onion" style to this dish was a bit odd\n\n- The battered cod sandwich with house potato chips while decent was too heavy on the oil and too light on the dressing\n\nFull on negative is one:\n\n- The prices ... they are ridiculously high for the type of restaurant and the food they serve (and anyone that reads my reviews knows that I rarely if ever comment on pricing)' u"I've heard a lot of good things about brunch here so I thought I would give it another shot. My friend had a reservation for 1pm. Unfortunately I couldn't make it on time for my reservation so I just told my friend to snag 2 seats at the bar for us. If it was a larger party there definitely would have been a wait for a table or seats at the bar. \n\nWe ordered some chips to share that were topped with blue cheese fondue. I ordered the Sicilian baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce artichokes burrata spinach and ciabatta. The chips were alright but after a while the chips became soggy with the toppings. When it was fresh it was pretty tasty but such a large portion it would be better if we were in a larger group. The eggs were surprisingly really good! I ended up eating all of it. The ciabatta bread however was pretty hard and I ended up not eating it. My friend ordered an eggs Benedict and she really liked it.\n\nThe thing that was lacking was the service. I had no idea which bartender was waiting for me. My friend ended up telling me he left half way through our meal and didn't say anything. It was hard ordering any beverages because I wasn't sure who took our drink. I would have had more cocktails if someone actually came around to us. \n\nThe saving grace however was the Photo Booth at the end. I love a good photoshoot!" u"Best brunch in Midtown East. Expect a wait if you don't have a reservation but there are many seats at the bar. Service is fast and friendly and we were impressed with how quickly the food came out. \n\nWe tried the Sicilian Baked Eggs and Breakfast Pot Pie. Both were amazing. The tanginess of the tomato sauce in the Sicilian Baked Eggs paired with the artichoke was such a delicious combination! The Pot Pie was rich and flavorful with three perfect eggs on top. \n\nDoesn't seem like they're doing the one free drink with brunch any more but I still enjoyed my grapefruit mimosa!" u"It's a hard decision for The Smith. Yes there are many reviews and people say this is one of THE places to get breakfast/brunch. The atmosphere is amazing. The communal seating area that's first come first serve is terrific if you don't have a large group/reservation. The service is prompt and efficient with complimentary sparkling and still water.\n\nBut the eggs benedict were overpriced at $17 for cold food for the same portion you can get elsewhere for cheaper. The poached eggs were watery. The english muffin wasn't crispy. The hollandaise was fresh and very lemony though. The hash was cold but thankfully still crispy along the edges. Sure the food came out right after I ordered but it goes to show it wasn't that fresh. Their Kensington Ketchup tastes like salsa FYI because they use green bell peppers in their mix. \n\nI loved how there were hooks under the table to hang your bag and the entire restaurant just had amazing natural lighting. From sitting by the open windows to the bar area to the communal table and all the way to interior back area the design and execution is really flawless. \n\nI didn't feel like waiting for eternity at Ess-a-bagel and there was practically no wait here for a small group. It's not worth it to get any of the classics here so go ahead and try that breakfast pot pie or Sicilian eggs just not the simpler things." u"The Smith is always a winner for brunch. Make. A. Reservation! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I got the egg white omelette which was healthy and filling yet light. It's nothing outstanding but it satisfies. If you like goat cheese and spinach get it. Comes with a small greens salad too. My friend got the Sicilian baked eggs (very similar to shakshuka if you're unfamiliar with this entree) which I've gotten before and absolutely love. Tried a bite and made a mental note to get it again next time. Other friend got the classic eggs benedict the classic bacon and eggs on an English muffin. \n\nI love the ambiance that The Smith embodies: bright buzzing with conversation modern filled with ambitious yet relaxed professionals and families. Our waitress Jenny was super friendly and helpful. Our coffees were refilled over and over and when my friend said it wasn't strong enough for him she gladly swapped it out for an espresso. Great service all around!" u'Loved everything!\n\nFrom the decor to the service to the food.. The Smith checked off all of our boxes. \n\nCame here for a brunch with my girlfriends on a Saturday morning. Our reservations were for 11:30am and we were seated right away. The place is relatively large and was packed out with a pretty long line of people waiting outside for seats. We got a nice little spot right by the large open doors to enjoy the fall breeze - the day was perfect!\n\nOur waitress was wonderful! Very attentive helpful & friendly :) \n\nThe menu is extensive and there are a ton of options for whatever you might be in the mood - from oysters to eggs Benedict to sandwiches and steaks. A lot of variety which we were excited about!\n\nI ordered the cod sandwich w| a side of fries - I devoured my sandwich in like 5 minutes it was sooo good! The bun was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The cod was cooked to perfection and the cole slaw added everything that the sandwich needed!  \n\nOne of my friends had the avocado toast topped with a poached egg.. the toast looked delicious and she said she really enjoyed her meal.\n\nMy other friend had a craving for seafood so she opted for the lobster roll with a side of French fries & whole heartedly enjoyed her meal. They are very generous with the lobster! \n\nWe shared the pancakes w| the whipped ricotta roasted pecans & caramel sauce - AMAZING. One of our favorite things that we tried here! Definitely get the pancakes!!! \n\nThe cappuccinos were great & strong.. and so were our drinks! I had the Bloody Mary. \n\n\nDefinitely recommend The Smith! We truly enjoyed everything and it was a great start to a perfect Saturday afternoon! We will be back!' u"On the search for a good brunch place in midtown early 10am on Sunday with a visitor in town and leaving to the airport by noon. This place worked out well! I was able to make ressies online and no hassles. When we arrived the place was bustling and filled with people waiting outside for their friends or a table. This is usually a good sign. I've only been to the one in East Village but the Smith standards go all across town. You can't go wrong here for brunch! I also like the fact that you get 1 free cocktail per brunch order included. \n\nMedium Rare Steak and Eggs with waffle potatoes -- WONDERFUL\nEggs Benedict \nBellini\nBloody Mary" u'I would highly recommend The Smith as a place to have a birthday brunch or to take your family when visiting New York. I live a few blocks away from The Smith and decided on going there with my parents thanks to the stellar Yelp reviews - fortunately I was not disappointed. We arrived without a reservation on a Saturday morning during peak traffic time and only had to wait around 5 minutes for a table - already an incredible showcase of the service and flexibility of the restaurant!\n\nThe location itself is incredibly deceiving as it is so much larger than meets the eye at the entrance. We were led to deep into the restaurant right next to a high ceiling section that had big windows to let light in. It was absolutely gorgeous seeing the sunlight stream in and light different tables and walls all around - it gave the place a very European feel which I absolutely love.\n\nI ordered the blueberry waffles with a dollop of vanilla ice cream as I was feeling sweet over savory that day. The waffle was moist warm and perfectly textured - I have quite high standards when it comes to waffles (especially when accompanied with ice cream as it tends to make it quite soggy) but it retained its texture and was perfectly complimented by the tart blueberry compote. My sister ordered potatoes with a poached egg and she also loved the dish. We will definitely be back here soon to soak in the wonderful locale and to try out some new dishes on the menu.' u"Made reservations for 8:30 Friday night. When we arrived early we had a short wait then were seated. Place is a little overwhelming on the noise front - they need some type of sound reduction. \n\nOur waiter quickly came over and had already been to happy hour so my friend and I decided to split the burrada and the Apple/squash salad. Both were AMAZING - if I'd had more room we definitely would have overeaten on bigger plates. With still a little room left we tried the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert. Such a seasonal delicious dish! It had cranberries on top and cinnamon ice cream - made me wish I could make this at home for Thanksgiving it was perfect. Next time I'm in the City I'd definitely come back for a full blown meal!" u"I love a great brunch in NYC and we had an outstanding meal at The Smith. I really can't think of one thing that we didn't all enjoy.\n\nWe went early on a Sunday morning and between the 7 of us we tried quite a few dishes. From the snacks and starters section we ordered the monkey bread with a toffee glaze and it was so good that we got a second order. The skillet roasted mac + cheese was supposed to be really good at this place but after many mac and cheese disappointments our expectations were low. After we tasted it we kept going back for more. It was cheesy and creamy just as a great mac and cheese should be.\n\nWe were really off to a great start!\nIn addition to snacks and starters the menu is organized into a number of other sections. Our table also got:\n\nEggs:\nBLT+E sandwich\nSteak and eggs\nSicilian baked eggs  \n\nPoached Eggs:\nShort rib hash\n\nGriddle \nVanilla bean french toast\nPancakes\n\nThe Sicilian baked eggs reminded me of a breakfast lasagna. It was delicious and probably the best item that I tried.\n\nThe Smith is a huge venue with sidewalk seating and a large space in the back that looks like it can be closed off for events. Our server offered recommendations and she steered us in the right direction with our menu choices. The prices were high as expected but the value was good. I hope to revisit The Smith on another visit to the city." u"Can I leave 6 Stars?\nI need to preface: I am not a fan of salt. But I also don't appreciate a cook/chef afraid to season the food. \nThe Smith does it right!\nThe venue offers breakfast through late night dining.\nIt's levels above a diner but it's not a stuffy snob-appeal restaurant. \nThe self description as a brasserie is not intended to sound haute it's spot on accurate.\n\nThe entry is unambiguous and inviting like a wrapped gift it offers promise of great things inside.\nI was quickly and amiably attended by the hostess who because I was alone directed me to a large family style table.\nGreat seating with a panoramic view of the airy open interior.\nVisibly clean.\nServers and staff bustling quickly with friendly purpose (thumbs up to Gabe and David).\nI was there for the breakfast menu.\nUncomplicated precise and with just enough choices for even the fussiest eater.\nI passed on the specialty breakfast sandwiches and omelettes opting instead for simple eggs with bacon and home fries.\nAdded a side of organic wheat bread with homemade strawberry compote.\n(It's not a jam or jelly compote is likely inaccurate. But the dense mix of pulverized fresh strawberries is exceptionally fruity and fresh. Probably should have its own food group.)\n\nMy eggs were over medium perfectly cooked and exactly as I ordered.\nHome fries were crisp but not overdone.\nApple-smoked bacon was cooked with the same crisp snap but not burned.\nAnd the lightly dressed mixed greens were fresh but not soggy.\nEqually notable and important everything was seasoned in a deliciously flawless presentation.\nYou should get the impression if you think I'm vague that the chef's cooking was optimally on target for both doneness and palate.\n\nService is fast and pleasant.\nManagement (Brittany) is equally approachable and available\n\nI was treated to dessert. \nA warm date bread slathered in a thick salted caramel toffee with chocolate and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\nA diabetic's nightmare but a dreamy indulgence for me.\n\nThe prices are beyond reasonable.\n\nI not only recommend The Smith I look forward to getting back to try the other menus.\nI live in Miami but this is another good reason to visit NYC.\n\nI returned for Sunday brunch. Steak and Eggs with a potato waffle is outstanding. Frequently when enjoying a restaurant returning to reproduce the experience is a disappointment. Not at The Smith. I was warmly welcomed back by hostess serving staff and bussers. Food was top notch in preparation presentation and palate; and my fellow diners at the large family style communal table were interesting and conversational.\nI really like the Smith!\nShout out to my server Courtney who upped my return experience by outstanding professionalism accompanying the fact she's also a Miami girl!" u"So disappointed in this place. You'd think for a business that is constantly busy they would know how to quote wait times correctly. But they don't. We were told the wait would be 25-35 min and we waited for 45 without hearing anything. Decided to walk up to the hostess stand to see why we were still waiting. No apology and we were told it would be 5-10 more minutes. Waited 5 more minutes and still nothing so we decided to leave. Before we left I asked them to take our name off the list as a courtesy. Still no apology. Again you would think that a business like this would have better customer service especially seeing as they were fully staffed. If you want to come here I would recommend making a reservation...somewhere else." u"One of those iconic brunch places of NYC. I have been to other locations of Smith and the midtown location is a bit smaller than the Flatiron one. Still good service with consistently heavenly food.\n\n*Vanilla bean french toast with caramelized bananas: get disss don't be turned away thinking that it is going to be too sweet - it's not! The vanilla bean is a true doesn't create that overly sickening sweetness. French toast is a wonderful thick slice of bread with yummy banana. Key here is NOT TOO SWEET. Great with coffee shareable between 2 people with a side of something else.\n\nDefinitely recommend making reservations for weekend brunch. After 10:30am gets very packed and loud." u"Came to smith for a lunchtime business meeting. It was sort of a mistake because it was quite loud BUT the food and service were spectacular. \n\nThey have both seltzer and filtered water at the table along with some bread and butter which is standard and enough to hold you for a the 10 minutes it takes for your order to come out. Yup 10 minutes kitchen is wicked fast. I order the salmon and toasted couscous with a tomato vinaigrette. It was so good. It was really fresh and the flavors were well put together. If I'm being nitpicky I wish there was something crunchy sprinkled on top for texture. It was surprisingly good and surprisingly light. Loved it. Ran me about $25 bucks. \n\nEveryone else enjoyed their plates as well. 1 person got the avocado toast which has sooo much avocado. Another got mussels. And someone else got the tuna salad which isnt a salad. Its seared mahi mahi over noodles and it is really luxurious." u"I had brunch here on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm and there was no wait. The restaurant is casual spacious and clean. They offered tap water as well as free sparkling water to start. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nJohnny Benedict which consisted of cheddar corn bread chicken sausage poached eggs spicy tomato hollandaise and home fries. This was sort of disappointed and it didn't suit my taste. The chicken sausage was served luke warm mild in taste kind of sweet. The cheddar corn bread had some odd seasoning. The hollandaise sauce was thick buttery. The eggs were perfectly poached. The home fries were nicely done but too salty. Eggs benedict was always my go-to choice and I think I would stick with the traditional. \n\nPancakes with whipped ricotta toasted pecans salted caramel sauce. This was by far one of the BEST pancakes I ever had. It was so fluffy moist and everything blended together so well. The caramel was not too overpowering and the ricotta was perfect! I was never into pancakes but The Smith really did it. If you enjoy the taste of pecan pie I would recommend this dish. \n\nJalapenos Cheddar Grits was delicious. But I always feel that way about cheese grits. Cheesy and comforting. I didn't really taste the jalapenos but the texture was great. Get it if you have room to splurge. \n\nPassion punch tasted like straight passion fruit juice without alcohol. Skip it. I think I shouldve gotten myself a mimosa instead. \n\nOverall the bill was about $65 for 2 people. That's expensive for brunch but it was worth it in my opinion. The portions are large and the waitress was attentive. I love the space that allows intimate dates as well as large groups. Will return!" u'The lobster roll was really good but their mac n cheese appetizer was fantastic. The menu was impressive and I will definitely be back for lunch again.' u"I work a lot of hours and sometimes on weekends so having a brunch spot that is close to work and easy to go before going to the office on weekends is a MUST! \n\nI've probably been to The Smith 5 times for brunch and it never disappoints. I've tried (either off my plate or someone else's) the avocado toast the breakfast biscuit/pie (I forgot the name) French toast pancakes the noodle tuna salad and the prime burger. I highly recommend all of these and always have the hardest time making a choice!"],0.474,0.205,0.795,0.0
48.Pio Pio 8,[u"Best Peruvian food in NYC.\nHuge space you rarely have to wait for a table.\nBig variety on the menu and the plates are huge.\nThe chicken combo is perfect for a group of 4. Lots of chicken and sides.\nThe Jalea plate is also huge and have a combination of calamari octopus shrimp and yuka.\nIt's with food for 3 people.\nNice place for a date can be romantic.\nThe prices are very affordable. \nGood drinks and good dessert also.\nNB ask the waiter for the garlic sauce. It's amazing." u"What more can be said about Pio Pio? There are 8 of them around the city. This one is huge with a long bar area and tables in the front main seating area farther in and an enormous sub-level that you overlook from the main seating area. And it's just pretty to look at with its wood branches all over the ceilings and walls. Downstairs is ideal for large groups birthday dinners and the like. There's loud music playing but not enough to make conversing difficult. It's a very hip and sexy atmosphere. You may want to put on some heels before coming here. \n\nWe split the Ceviche Mixto and the Aji de Gallina. I think the ceviche was one of the best I've ever had. It was a pretty big portion and had all sorts of things like shrimp calamari and octopus. I love my seafood! The Aji de Gallina was made up of shredded chicken in amarillo sauce. It was so beyond creamy way too creamy for me and it didn't have much of a taste so I doused it in their green table sauce. I think we just ordered the wrong chicken dish because while I'm sure others would like this dish it was just too heavy and bland for me. I would totally return and try something else though because it is very much a quality Peruvian restaurant with excellent service." u"I hope management reads this. The company that they use for delivery is by far the worst operation I've ever seen. I'm all about supporting mom and pop shops but this 3rd party service is beyond crazy. They sent a text stating that the food was packed and ready at 6:40pm and its now 8:30 and it still hasn't arrived. After calling the restaurant time and time again they told me I had to contact this 718 number. I called and got rerouted back to the restaurant. They told me this time to press 8 to connect to a live rep. Once I was able to get a live person on the phone his mic wasn't working so I could barely even hear him. After he adjusted it I was finally able to hear him give me some comical excuse and he said it would be there in 20 mins. Seriously? I'm expected to wait 2.5 hrs? The food will surely be cold as it is outside. And on top of that they have the nerve to charge me a $10 delivery fee for going just a few blocks? \n\nI love Pio Pio's food. Its undeniably amazing but they need to get on Uber Eats immediately. I will never ever order delivery from here again." u"The hour long wait was totally worth it! The food here was so good!\n\nA group of friends and I went here to celebrate some November birthdays but the restaurant didn't offer same day reservations and we were too indecisive to definitively plan ahead. So we just showed up and asked to put our name on the wait list.\n\nAfter the long wait we were rewarded with an entrance into their large open dining room. The atmosphere was pretty chill with some tables hosting large parties out to celebrate with a nice dinner.\n\nAnd what a dinner you get here! We started with some cocktails the Peruvian specialty drink the pisco sour. Then the main course we ordered their special Peruvian style chicken. And it was so mouthwateringly delicious. The green chimichuri sauce was the perfect accompaniment to spice up the flavor. I can't wait to go back here and try more items on their menu." u"I'm so picky about my Peruvian Food. But you come here for the rotisserie chicken over the lomo saltado. This is not a Chifa. Really friendly people nicer than casual eat-in atmosphere and outdoor seating. \n\nThings to Note:\n1) Pio Pio started in Queens or something and there are several around the City. So Pio Pio 1 2 3 4 5 etc.\n2) This is a solid place to eat in or take out. \n3) Side dishes like maduros are delish\n4) This green sauce. OMG it's spicy it's delicious I don't even know what this verde sauce is but it's heavenly and get extra." u"This location of Pio Pio is by far my favorite. It's also the biggest one I've gone to! There are basically two floors to the place. Food is delicious. My boyfriend and I each got the Lomo Saltado and an order of plantains...portions that will surely fill your tummy! The steak in the Lomo Saltado was juicy warm and cooked medium-well. \n\nPrices for this place would be $$. One entree can cost you about $28...but I'll pay that ten times over because the meals are just so delicious! \n\nWe were seated in the bottom level and were very impressed with the decor. Very modern contemporary and clean look. Lights are dim to our liking as well. BUT it is super super noisy. LOTS of noise to the point where we have to really shout to hear each other across the table. Definitely by far one of the noisier restaurants we've been to. That being said the both of us won't be going back there seeking an intimate setting anytime soon. It'd be better to go with a larger group of people. \n\nA reservation during dinner time is recommended :)." u"Had a nice reunion with my high school friend here when I visited NYC. The food amount is ridiculous! We ordered one combo to share and we barely finished! Basically asked to go boxes for every plate. The chicken was very flavorful and obviously plantains is a must. I felt like the food was so much that it became hard to enjoy a bit stressed after eating so much there's still so much left but I understand that is such a first world problem \nI think my favorite will always be flor de mayo but pio pio would be the next in line!" u'This place is so much bigger inside that I could have ever imagined. It is also a place that is packed to the brim with people on weekends and can be a bit loud so just be prepared for that.\n\nThat being said they serve up some great ceviches and chicken and the portion sizes are quite large especially considering the price.\n\nIs this a place I would go to very often? Probably not just because of the sheer volume of people but all of the food is decent nonetheless.' u'My date and I decided to have dinner here on a Sunday night (night before LDW) and I\'m glad that we did.  We sat at the bar and I was really surprised at how spacious the bar was. The bar area itself wasn\'t as busy as the rest of the restaurant so it was a good spot to start the night. We had a few drinks before dinner and the bartender overall did an ok job. I would\'ve expected them to staff the bar a little better since it was a holiday weekend. We had a bit of trouble getting service from the bartender but understood that he was the ONLY bartender. No points taken for that. \n\nHowever the food definitely made up for the lack of service. To start we had the chicken empanadas which was fantastic. Crunchy on the outside not too hot on in the inside and the filling was "oh so good!" We ordered the Peruvian Combo which was more than enough food for the both of us and the chicken was tender juicy and DELICIOUS! Who knew chicken could taste so good? The avocado and the tomato side dish was a great complement to the rich chicken. Having the fresh vegetable to cut through the chicken was very satisfying!!! Oh and the sauce that came with the combo.... I wanted to bottle it up and take it with me! I left satisfied and wanted more but I was stuffed. I will definitely come back!!' u"Menu:\nGood variety of dishes. We ordered Juanita's half chicken mixed steamed vegetables empanadas de pollo and the tamal limeno for dinner. The prices are reasonable. The chicken was tasty. The other dishes were good.\n\nService:\nGood. Friendly and prompt service. \n\nVenue:\nThe area that were were sitting in was very dark. The couple to my left used their phone's flash light to get a closer look at their meal. The layout is interesting with 2 levels of seating lots of wood. It would be nice if there was a bit more illumination in the space." u"I came here for lunch on Friday at 1pm with some coworkers. \n\n// Atmosphere\nFrom the outside Pio Pio is pretty easy to miss. There's no sign above the door and it looks tiny. However when the hostess brought us in the restaurant kept going and opened up into a huge 2-floor seating area. Very impressive! The decor was beautiful as well! I wasn't expecting it to be so classy inside.\n\n// Service\nThey only allow up to 2 checks per table. Service was prompt and she kept coming to check on us without being bothersome. \n\n// Lunch Special\nMake sure to ask about the lunch special because it's not listed anywhere. It's $12 and includes a quarter chicken saffron rice and beans separate from each other salad and a soft drink. I recommend getting dark meat because I ordered white and it was dry. Everything was well-spiced and they have delicious green sauce at the table to add to your meal. The salad had bits of celery in it which was really tasty!" u"This review is for Pio Pio Hell's Kitchen and their UWS location. \n\nI'm a frequent to this place for past 4 years. I've noticed during my last three visits to the above two locations that the quality of their seafood (in Aroz Con Paella) has significantly gone down. Not sure is it's a supplier issue or change in management. It'd be nice if they can pay more attention to the basics." u"The chicken what they're known for lived up to its hype. Succulent flavor in every crevice. Two of us tore through it easily. Ceviche was okay. The fish wasn't the highest of quality.\nThe ambiance is odd. There's like this subterranean cave that's dark-walled with some abstract art and dimly lit. Service: meh. In summary: I kind of wanted to leave after we finished the chicken but we got stuck there a little unnecessarily long." u"Perfect place for a quick bite or a catch-up dinner with girlfriends. Hip and trendy and loud very loud so if you're looking to not shout while dining ask to be seated near the front. You'll still get loud music overhead but at least you won't have the thunderous roar of hoards of diners below in the sub-level pit. \n\nSo many goodies on the menu but I always go back to my main staples: Juanita's chicken and a side of tostones. The half chicken is good for two people and the tostones are way too many but so irresistible you won't stop yourself from eating them all. \n\nOther favorites: avocado+tomato salad. The avocados are always perfectly ripe.\n\nThe water waiters are always so on point. I hope they get tipped-out. On those hot summer nights when we're all guzzling some cold h2o they're always right behind us making sure our glasses are full. Thanks guys!!" u'Food - Excellent food and value.  Typically we get the Matador Combo portion sizes are large.  Easily feed 3-4 people.  \n\nService - Decent service but nothing to rave about\n\nAtmosphere - Nice decor.  Very modern looking' u'I absolutely this place!! The food is amazing the service is stellar and the drinks are amazing!!' u"Anyone who can guzzle the Matador combo should be put in the hall of pio pio fame. Aside from being a beast of a feast you can sample 5 peruvian classics (minus ceviche).\n\nThe salchipapas is like munchies' heaven. That green sauce they give you for the salad is great on everything. Even though the rice and beans were lacking in a portion they were delish.  Tostones have averted me many times and this time was no different. Tbh it's all about that maduros life at pio pio. While the whole rotisserie chicken looked like it'd be a homerun it was too charred and lacking seasoning.  Bottomline: Get the Matador if you're out with 3 to 4 people or if you have a raging appetite. Tip: Order a carafe of Sangria instead of by the glass. There are ~ 4 servings making it ~$4.50 per person." u'We were hungry we were thirsty and we landed on this delightful gem of a Peruvian restaurant. It was bustling the music pumping and a positive energy was felt by all. \n\nWe had reservations but I think we would have been fine without it. It was a Tuesday night at 830 pm and it still seemed like seating was plentiful. We were seated at a spacious booth perfect for our group. \n\nWe started out with a pitcher of Red Sangria refreshing and flavorful. Perfect to cool us down because not only was it hot and humid outside it was hot and humid inside as well. No AC? AC not working? I don\'t know but I\'m not rating them on their air conditioning let\'s talk about the food. \n\nWe started out with Fried Calamari and the Ceviche Sample Platter. Both delicious and I would order them again. The Ceviche was delicious each little ceramic platter more delightful than the last. I\'m not usually a squid person when it comes to ceviche but it was tender and delicious. 30.00 for the platter and worth it. \n\nWe then ordered the Matador Combo (40.00) which comes with mouthwatering whole chicken cut up fried plantains with a delicious garlic sauce beans and red rice french fries with sliced hot dogs (they call them salchicha).... seems weird but delicious none the less. We didn\'t think we would have enough chicken so we ordered Half a Juanita (essentially half chciken) which sounded strange when my husband ordered it as I thought to myself.... "should I be concerned about Juanita?"\n\nTop it off with a bottle of red and we were done. There were 6 of us with leftovers to eat at midnight. No room for dessert my stretchy pants were stretched to the max. \n\nParking? UM no.... you\'re in NYC. \nService? Major language barriers but attentive enough. \nFood? Superb\n\nGo here eat here and enjoy.' u"We came to celebrate my friend Merce daughter's Graduation from NYU with a Masters degree.\nFamished is not the word we were parched after sitting for 3+ hours at the ceremony. Four rounds of water  for everybody.\nThen we order a pitcher of Sangria. Nice!\nSome Pisco Sour(Passion Fruit).\nWe ordered different appetizers and main dishes and share.\nAvocado Salad Empanadas Papas  a la Huancaina\nSalchipapas Tamales.\nLomo Salteado Jalea Arroz Chaufa Chicken.\nDesserts Tres Leches y Helados.\n\nThen a month later we come to celebrate Father's Day.\n\nMore or less the same menu.\n\nEverything delicious. The Lomo flavorful pieces of beef saut\xe9 with vegetables. \nThe Chaufa rice is their version of Fried Rice \nJalea a mixture of Seafood and Fried Yuca.\nThe Chicken well seasoned and roasted moist.\n\nSpacious area down stairs for groups.\nNice ambiance." u"4.5 stars\nThank you random New York native for this recommendation! After chatting with someone at Shake Shack he redirected me here to Pio Pio for the ceviche and chicken. He didn't steer me wrong.\n\nThe ceviche was delicious but I do wish they served it with chips or something on the side. My friend and I ordered the half chicken and it lived up to the reviews. We had sangria- it crept up on me fast but it was great as well.\n\nOverall the vibe was upscale and dark. You can definitely come here casual but it seemed like a date-y place. The interior was surprisingly large with an upstairs and downstairs.\n\nThere was a little messup with our check but it was resolved quickly. I'd love to come back and try more food."],0.6369,0.344,0.656,0.0
131.Ding Szechuan and Hot Pot Restaurant,[u"To my surprise I actually like this place after hearing over and over again that you can't find good Asian food in Midtown. This place has a lot of variety--you can get hot pot Korean BBQ spicy dried pot noodle soups etc. My friend and I spontaneously decided to come here as we were passing by.\n\nI order the spicy dried pot which is what I usually like to get at Szechuan restaurants. For dinner it was $16.95 for an order which included 1 meat and 3 vegetables of my choice. I picked fish fillet lotus root bean sprouts and cabbage. I also picked mild level spicy.\n\nI was expecting it come out in a stainless steel pot with a fire at the bottom but it just came out on a regular plate. My favorite part about this dish is that it was not super oily like what I usually get from other Szechuan restaurants. The fish fillet was also previously breaded and fried which gave it a great texture. I also liked how they did not skimp out on the lotus root since other places usually only give a couple of pieces. I would come back to this spot to get spicy dried pot when I crave it since it is close. I would also get medium spicy or more since mild was not spicy at all." u'The restaurant is way over priced even at this location. And they don\'t even serve authentic Chinese food. \n\nThe lady who claimed to be the manager has some serious attitude issues. I ordered the farm house pork for both lunch and dinner ( $10 for lunch and $19.6 for  dinner my company paid for it) and they had the same portion. I told the lady about it and she just kept denying it. She reluctantly went to the kitchen and added some after I said I would take pictures and prove to her the next day. She became so rude and started pointing fingers and said:" this is the only time you get double portion you are not gonna get it next time."  Oh please save it for yourself sounds like you are the customer and you are the only restaurant here.\n\nTerrible place. DO NOT GO.' u"I came in this restaurant at 7:30 PM. Surprisingly not much people in there. You should know that this restaurant is very close to the Times Square. \n\nSince not much people in there it turns out to be a really quiet place not the typical Chinese restaurant that in your mind. It has a relatively broad Chinese dishes (BBQ Hot Pot Szechuan Style).\n\nTo be fair the three dishes I ordered was amazing.  However I have to admit that they are not cheap. Three different dishes cost me $55 without tips. The food is definitely Szechuan Style with pepper and chili spicy tho. Check out the photo I took and you may want to give it a shot. I would suggest you guys go there with friends. Portion of the food is entree level for each dishes.\n\nRating is for food only (4 Star). Price is a little high since it's location. Tho it's kinda a awkward place too many fast food and restaurants near this place. It will be really hard for it to stand out. Give it a shot if you like spicy." u"We were looking for a Chinese hot pot place to try while in Manhattan and found this one on Yelp as we love to have hot pot. We went inside and we're greeted immediately by the friendly waitress and she shows us to our seats. \n\nThe restaurant is in a decent area with Chinese style decoration on the walls. It has a good vibe compared to some other hotpot places we've been to. So my husband tried the hotpot with beef and various kinds of vegetables while I ordered a bowl of noodle. The meat quality was very good and it's fast to be cooked in the small pot as only him having the hotpot. \n\nSo the thing about this restaurant is that if only one person tries the hotpot the waitress will use the small pot on the right side of that person's table instead of heating up the big one in the middle. So that was kind of interesting to us. The hotpot was good decent flavor. My spicy beef noodle soup was worth the try too. Nothing too special though. I would say it is a a good family gather place to have meals." u"Pretty decent hot pot compared to the other places I've gotten in Manhattan.  The spicy hot pot was pretty good we got 2 beef plates and 1 lamb.  The beef was definitely my favorite.  Also got chinese lettuce mushrooms and shrimp fried rice.  Definitely enough for 4 people. \n\nService was excellent and the location was great as well.  No line on a Saturday night so we were seated quickly.  They have a self serve sauce section so it was easy to make your own dipping sauce for the hot pot. \n\nWill definitely try to come back!" u"Friend and I were craving Hot Pot and wanted something close to our offices in Midtown. I've heard great things about Chinatown over in Grand or Flushing but time was a competing priority so we resorted to a nearby restaurant in Times Square. \n\nWe arrived and were greeted with a friendly waitress who served us throughout our time. The restaurant seems to offer many dishes ranging from hot pot to traditional family style. We went ahead and ordered the Hot Pot with two flavors of pork and Sichuan and a range of assorted meats and vegetables to go along with it. \n\nThe Hot Pot was a-ok and the assorted meats and veggies were decent. The broths for both were plain and didn't feel all that special. The pork broth was a little more flavorful than the Sichuan and ended up being the broth of choice for my friend and I. The meats were not as lean and the noodles came in small portions for the price we paid. Vegetables were somewhat fresh and always taste good regardless of the restaurant. \n\nI did not see any key differentiators than what I've had in the past. Past 'A' Hot Pot experiences offered more sauce combinations fresher ingredients and even an 'All You Can Eat' option. The bill ended up around $95-ish which was a bit steep for the actual food that we consumed. Overall it was a meh experience and I will likely not return for its Hot Pot given the tens of other options around town." u'Walked in and got seated right away and ordered the BBQ thin sliced brisket. The waitress cooked it for me at my table as opposed to me cooking it myself. The best food item I had on this trip to NYC was their Szechuan Pork Wontons. Very good.' u"Went here for dinner on a chilly Saturday evening. It was fairly crowded but they were able to immediately seat my party of 2. The restaurant is quite spacious and clean. \n\n\nMy review is for the Spicy Dry Pot. Initially we were a bit worried about ordering to meet the weight minimums. However our server was really nice about it and explained how they changed their process of ordering based on portion size instead of pounds. We ordered 3 portions of meat/fish (beef x2 and fish fillet x 1) and 3 portions of vegetables (fried tofu bok choy and black fungus). Rice is also included. My friend and I also have different levels of spice tolerance so they gave us extra chili oil on the side. They're also very generous with the serving size we even had a decent amount of food leftover. It only cost about $23. \n\n\nHope to come back in the future and try out the hot pot!" u"We were walking around hungry after watching a show at Longview Theater and just popped in here because it was next door. Didn't expect much but boy was I wrong! This place is surprisingly authentic and delicious. Pricey (avg $18/dish for dinner) but the food service and ambiance are all pretty darn good. The trio of mixed mushrooms was light and umami and just yum. The spicy Sichuan fish (\u6c34\u716e\u9c7c) -- though I didn't try it everyone else loved it and it was very quickly finished with people still fishing around the huge bowl to try and grab last morsels. \u9ebb\u8fa3\u9999\u9505 aka spicy dried pot (we need a better English name for this) was one of my favorite foods in China and it's just as fragrant and delicious here. For dinner you get 1 meat and 3 veggies of your choice. For a tried and tested pot feel free to copy my winning combo of tofu black fungus enoki mushroom and broccoli. Spicy isn't spicy enough though my only complaint! Everything was delicious we'll be back after the next show" u"Overall rating (1-5)\nAtmosphere/cleanliness - 5\nService - 4\nMenu options - 3\nFood - 3\nPrice - 2\nTotal - 17/5= 3.4\n\nPrime location at Times Square very nice store front and interior design with a full bar. I felt spacious and comfortable when I first walk in. Tables were clean. I give this place a 5/5 for atmosphere and cleanliness. \n\nService was very fast severs were nice. They didn't check on us regularly but when we stopped them they got us what we wanted right away. Waiting time for food was less than 5 minutes. They could improve by checking in once in a while and see how's everything is going. But overall no complain. Service is a 4/5.\n\nMenu options was fairly standard. They offered Chinese dishes hot pot and Korean BBQ. Judging from the hotpot menu they offered the regular meat (beef/lamb/chicken) seafood meat balls and vegetables. If you're familiar with other hot spot places in downtown this place actually offer fewer options. To me as this place is more up scale in the crazy world of Times Square I was expecting some more exotic/delicate menu options. Therefore menu options is a 3/5.\n\nFor food we ordered a half and half hot pot (Chinese herb and duck) based. A plate of beef fried tofu Chinese cabbage black fungus pork balls and udon. Everything was fresh. Food was fair nothing special. Food 3/5.\n\nLastly this place is pricy. Food portion was small and expensive. We ordered one platter of meat and everything else was vegetable and the bill came up to about $60 for two. If I had the choice I'd pick any All you can eat hot pot over this. But then again it's Times Square. Price 2/5.\n\nIn conclusion I think I had an ok experience dinning at Ding spent hour and a half eating and catching up with a coworker." u"The food was above average... but needed a little salt... I would of given the place 4 stars but there's a few things that made me change my mind last minute. \nThe menu is hard to follow as where all the chicken dishes to beef dishes are? Takes a while to navigate when you have to read each one. Lol\n\n The night we are here the AC wasn't working lol but I'm not criticizing them for that there's nothing you can do when crap like that happens I felt for the people working there! My hats off to them. \n\nPlace was clean and great decor as well as the ambiance. But the servers were very helpful and accommodating to us. I would give this place a try again when back in town." u"I'm traveling for business and wanted hot pot so happy they have hot pot for one. I got the dry hot pot for dinner (basically cooked hot pot without any broth and much faster than cooking it yourself although less interactive)- you can choose a meat and 3 veggies. If you want to add more it costs extra. You can also make your own sauce. Delicious!" u"This is a 5-star restaurant for authentic Sichuan food that is very close to being as varied and deliciously hot as you would expect in Chengdu where I visit often. There is nothing quite like the Sichuan pepper. It is hot and numbing but with a flavor profile that is sweet and unmistakably wonderful. By comparison the Mexican jalape\xf1o or habanero are just raw burners with no other redeeming attribute. We all have our perpetual searches for the holy grail of certain foods - I went through too-long creme br\xfbl\xe9e and fettuccine Alfredo periods in my youth and then steak houses (not quite out of the woods yet) - and my current obsession is Mapo Tofu; in the New York City metro area the best so far is here at Ding's. I expected to find it in Flushing but that was just a distraction." u"Nice sit down restaurant with pretty good pricing for what you get. My family and I ordered the dry hot pot option with beef and fish and a bunch of different veggies like lotus roots cabbage watercress mushrooms and etc. In addition to that we also got a large bowl of hot and sour soup.\n\nThe flavors of the dry hot pot were good and true to the spicy Szechuan flavors. Pairs very well with rice and our portions were substantial even for 3 people. Didn't amaze me or anything though. The hot and sour soup tastes a little different than I've usually had it. The only way I can describe it is having a darker flavor and I wasn't the biggest fan. Although it was still decent and the mushrooms tofu and bamboo inside are good quality. Pretty sure for our whole order it didn't top $30 and that's great for 3 people in NYC!" u"I'm from China. So 4 star is normally the highest I will give for any Chinese restaurant that is trying to be authentic. It actually means it is really really really good.\nOne star goes to its dinning environment. It is a fairly new place. Clean and spacious. \n\nFood:\nSpicy wonton. Well flavored a lot of meat filled inside. Wish it could be spicier.\n\nSpicy dry pot: pretty decent. We got beef shrimp beef tripes cabbage mushrooms and fish cake. All ingredients seem to be pretty fresh. Vegetarian chicken was not the normal vegetarian chicken. I would call it an special type of tofu (qian ye tofu for those who may know what I'm talking about). I used to order it all the time when I was home. It is kind of rare to find any Chinese restaurant with it. loved it. \n\nDessert: a sweet soup with rice ball (jiu niang yuan zi). Not sure if it were on the menu. I just asked for it and it was HUGE. Haha but it came with nice little rice balls ( no filling) egg. Just yummy" u"I rate this place 3.5 stars and rounded up. I brought my group of 18 here after my first choice (Hometown) was fully booked. I didn't bother for my second choice (99 favors) as I didn't want to be limited to 2-hours of dining especially since we were getting together for a surprise farewell party and hot pot. I must thank Lisa and her staff who took very good care of us (which is why I rounded up instead of down as service is important to me). \n\nMy reservation was at 7:30 but knowing that my group tends to arrive late I asked them all to come at 7. Around 7:15 a majority of the group arrived and the staff of Ding began to kindly sit us early. I appreciate this as most places insist that your entire party must be present. However I must admit that if it wasn't for us the place probably wouldn't have been fully packed.\n\nIt took us about 30+ min to order as the menu was a little hard to comprehend along with the fact that we were all waiting for my friend to come and surprise him. I imagine that the staff must've been annoyed but I appreciate that they didn't nag or rush us and allowed us to do our thing (thanks again!). Once we were finally able to order my friends told me that they took a little too long to serve us anything (such as water); I didn't notice as I was running a White Elephant game (I do NOT recommend for this space...). \n\nWe had hot pot and we enjoyed it. However note that the spicy soup is REALLY spicy! Half of us were crying when we tasted it...and we had even diluted it with water! It was also on the pricier-side.\n\nAll-in-all the food here is decent and they are striving to improve and provide great service which is definitely important in my eyes so I'm happy to round my 3.5 stars up to 4." u'Pretty decent hot pot place. Great variety of ingredients and vegetables. You can get either a shared half/half hot pot (choose different broths- spicy not spicy etc) or individual hot pots. For the individual hot pots it is a combo and you don\'t get to choose the exact ingredients but the amount is just right for 1 person. I got a vegetable hot pot and there was a nice range of different veggies tofu mushroom and noodles. There is a "veggie broth" option but its pretty much just hot water and they put a bunch of veggies in it so it isn\'t that flavorful. \n\nThere is a sauce bar so you can make your own dipping sauces. They also have alcohol/beer. \n\nThis place is ala carte and not all-you-can-eat like many other hot pot places in the area. It does add up and can be a little pricey. If you plan to eat ALOT i recommend making the trip to an AYCE hot pot place for better value for money. \n\nI do like that they have options for appetizers & entrees as well just in case someone in your party rather not have hot pot.\n\nDing BBQ/Hot Pot has a variety of options for everyone-- shared hot pot individual hotpot szechuan food veggie options. A good place for a family or group dinner. Service was great and very friendly/attentive.' u"This review is for their Sichuan dishes only.\n\nEntering the restaurant the aroma of the hot pots made the place smell authentic and delicious.  However we opted to order two Sichuan dishes: MaPo tofu and braised sliced beef.\n\nSimilar to the other Sichuan restaurants in NYC these staples weren't any different or special. In fact I thought it was one of the worst MaPo tofu I had especially when the minced pork started to congeal together as we were eating it. \n\nThe price is a bit more expensive than Han Dynasty though that might just be because of the location of the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend others to come here for Sichuan dishes but perhaps their ma-la tang (spicy dry pot) and hot pots would be better options. \n\nIf you are looking for a Sichuan restaurant in NYC I wouldn't recommend to come here unless it's out of convenience." u"The dry pot is not tasty ...ordered the delivery.. to be fair delivered very fast..but the dry pot was really not good..this is my second time try the dry pot (I am very persistent) here..but it failed twice..I thought Man Ting's dry pot is just so so..this place is worse..." u"Horrible service. \n1. There were tables but for some reason it took them 10 minutes to seat us. \n2. While waiting for a table we asked to get some hot sake and were told by one server that they don't serve hot sake. Which is fine... if it were true.\n3. After flagging down different waiters we were finally able to get a table and noticed that the menu says they have HOT SAKE. \n4. It took 20 minutes to get the hot sake. It took 30 minutes to get our food. \n\nHorrible service. Ruined my first night during my first visit to NY. Thanks a lot!"],0.4926,0.761,0.239,0.0
1.Wafles & Dinges,[u'So delighted that this delicious waffle shop has now opened this new location right in the heart of Times Square with a bunch of outdoor tables so you can watch the crossroads of the world go by while you eat the very best Belgian waffle outside Belgium!\n\nIf this place were named after my reviews they\'d have to change it to "Waffling & D**k-jokes." I may be prone to verbal diatribe and childish humour (if you can call it humour) but at least I\'m self-aware. Then again they said Leopold of Belgium was self-aware and that didn\'t help him much.\n\nWhat to get: Liege Waffle with Spekuloos.\nWhat the f*** is Spekuloos: It\'s when you can\'t find your glasses. Duh.\nAnd what else: Well the Spekuloos Ice Cream is pretty amazing too.\nWhat\'s the difference between a Liege Waffle and the other kind?: Well the other kind are good but this one is in a Liege of its own.\nBut this is in America not Belgium: I know. And much like \'Murca if you don\'t like it then why don\'t you liege.\n\nIf this place were frequented by ducks rather than humans and was also really dirty inside then it\'d be called "Waddles & Dingy." Whereas if I had a bright idea (lightbulb switches on above my head cartoon style) about time travelling then it\'d be "Wormholes & Ding!"\n\nI won\'t go on and on about these waffles. I\'ll just tell you straight away: these are by far the best waffles I\'ve ever had in the United States. I\'m not a huge waffle fan but when I go to Belgium I fall in love with the taste of the dense sticky orgasmic Liege Waffles perfected at Maison Dandoy in Brussels. Well these may not be on the MD level but these are the closest thing you will ever find in North America that\'s for sure. They taste a lot more Belgian than they do American and that is a very very good thing.\n\nPeople ask why I\'m so attracted to Borat. I think it was his "Onesies & Dimples." It must be that because it ain\'t his face. He\'s a tip drill.\n\nAdding the Spekuloos just takes it through the roof. It\'s a Gingerbread Spread (think Nutella but even more addictive) which comes - of course - from Belgium. Also known as Belgique (French) or Belgie (Flemish). Flemish is basically like Dutch but a Belgian version of it. The country is split between the two languages. The French speakers are known as Walloons. But history and geography lessons aside Belgium really does make the best waffles on earth and these Liege Wafles with Spekuloos really are the closest thing to the real thing you can get over here.\n\nIf you\'re in a "linen cleaning contest" make sure you get the linens *absolutely* clean. Because if there\'s a tiny bit of dirt even a little speck of dust you lose. This concept is known as "Speck-u-lose."\n\nNot only am I obsessed with them (and I\'m not even a waffle fan) but everyone I\'ve ever taken here - and to the one on Ave B - fell in love with them too. They\'re sticky and gooey and hot and sexy. They\'re heavenly and divine and delectable and filling too. You can split one with someone since they\'re heavy and they\'re not too expensive either.\n\nI\'m not sure whether there are any illegal drugs in the Spekuloos. I\'d rather not Spekulate.\n\nAs I said get the amazing Spekuloos all over them and be aware that they also have Spekuloos (Gingerbread) Ice Cream here which is absolutely divine as well. Now that they are right in the heart of Times Square you have no excuse at all not to go. Try the nearby Chicken Tikka from Biryani Cart too.\n\nOh and you know that movie Star Trek III: The Search For Spock? Well in Belgium that movie was known as "Spock-u-lost."\n\nIf you come to Manhattan you simply must make it a point to stop in here and try a Liege Waffle with Spekuloos. It may just be one of the best desserts you will ever consume in America.\n\nIf I have a whole bunch of girls asking to be spanked then I\'d rather save the best for last honey. And since you\'re the best that means I\'m going to "Spankulast."\n\nWafles & Dinges. Get here. Be amazed.\n\nAlthough if it were my 2 favourite things to get in back alleys in Chinatown then it\'d be "Won-Ton & D**k." Ooh I just turned myself on.' u'I admit i was addicted to this place until they served me an already barely warm waffle that they insisted was hot off the press. Thanks for saving me a few pounds.'],0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0
109.El Rey Annex,[u'Super conveniently located at the northeast corner of Madison Sq Park. While it does say El Rey on the window the door is labeled otherwise (and then the next door down is boxing) so be sure you don\'t miss it!\n\nThe people that work there seem to be super chill and nice. Not the typical "I hate my job what do you want" feel that I get from most NYC coffee shops so that\'s a huge plus. Great place to grab and go but they also have a few tables.\n\nNothing better on a chilly fall day than a solid latte to warm you up so I tried out their matcha latte. Very happy I did! Wonderfully made; no clumps plenty of matcha (so many other places skimp out) and of course presentation was nice. They also have a variety of pastries to choose from. The blueberry cheese danish was wonderfully buttery and flavorful. The pastries are brought in but they have some menu items made in house too.\n\nThey\'ll be open officially this Thursday! Definitely worth a stop in. I\'ll definitely be back to try more!' u"I'm still devastated that the cook didn't show up today (?) so we couldn't order any toasts or salads but for some reason the guy knew how to make an egg sandwich and it was incredible.\n\nThey also carry Balthazar and Roberta's pastries as well as some housemade stuff. The cookies are ok but the Sweet Potato Pecan Bread ($4) is really great.\n\nDefinitely try that egg sandwich though ($8) and make sure to add some crispy pancetta (+ $2). One of the best egg sandwiches in recent memory for sure.\n\nI will be back for those toasts and bowls hopefully when there's a cook here next time." u"Good egg sandwich but very small. Good coffee but unlike many sit-down brunch destinations no refills for those dining in. I can imagine this being a nice stop for tourists looking for a quick nosh between meals but at least as far as the breakfast was concerned it's not even close to a meal in itself despite being priced as such. Which is a shame for those who live in the neighborhood which could really use a casual counter-service type brunch place."],-0.2551,0.094,0.767,0.14
202.Park Avenue Tavern,[u"Park Avenue Tavern was exactly what I was looking for. \n\nI'm convinced that eating at a bar is the savior of the business traveler. I can eat alone while having good food and probably have some good conversation. \n\nThe food and the service was quite good. My only complaint was how loud and rowdy the place was but it was a Saturday night. \n\nOverall a good place for a bite to eat and a drink but not a good place for a quiet meal on a Saturday night." u'Great place for after work drinks. The vibe is nicer than your average bar and their food and drink menu is decent.\n\nI came here for a happy hour and sampled their many beers and wines. Food consisted of a veggie platter egg rolls grilled cheese sliders wings etc - your typical bar food.\n\nWhat sets this place apart is that each table has three drafts on tap and you can serve yourself! The meter is reset when you sit down and you can help yourself to as much beer as you want! At the end of your stay you pay for the amount of beer you poured. Each table has different drafts so choose wisely!' u"Great spot to pop in for a few drinks or a quick bite to eat. It's located sort of in the middle of everything off of Park Ave so pay attention when you're searching for it. \n\nWhen I walked in I was quickly greeted by friendly hostess and given choice of seats at the bar or tables around the restaurant. Opted for tables so I could do a little people watching as the sun set. You immediately notice how neat and organized everything inside this place seems and that's not what I expected really. \n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful and had a great sense of humor as well. I tried the Tavern Burger and also had them make me an Irish coffee (not on menu but you can ask for it) and everything was delicious. \n\nIf I'm ever looking for a place to stop after leaving Grand Central or walking around that part of the city it'll definitely be here again!" u"Cute atmosphere spacious and great service. The clientele here during HH seems older (30s+). \n\nMy friend and I got drinks and an app. The drinks were straight from the bottle so not much to be said there. We got the eggplant fries with curry aioli. The eggplant fries were good and crispy. Expensive for what it was but good nonetheless. I personally didn't like the curry aioli. It's nice but as you continue to eat the curry flavor compounds and becomes too intense and overpowering. \n\nI think I'll check this place out another time and see how the clientele is then." u"Wow great night here at PAT!   Super fun vibe very lively at happy hour.  It quieted down later though.  Drinks were terrific and service was perfect never had to wait for anything but didn't feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe food was terrific all around.   Started with artichoke and spinach dip..so good.  Then had cheese curds.  I used to live in Wisconsin so I know fried curds and these were exceptional!  My friend who had never had them before was blown away.  Then we had buffalo chicken dip served with crispy bread that was almost like a won-ton.  It was amazing!  We ate the whole thing.\n\nI then had sliders for my entree.  They were huge!  The burgers were at least an inch thick I only ate two of the three.   Then because we were celebrating my birthday belatedly the manager Chris gave us a chocolate chip skillet cookie with vanilla ice cream.  It was outstanding.\n\nThis place is awesome I recommend that you go there immediately.  Are you still reading this review?  What are you waiting for hit the PAT!" u"So this is where Mad Men extras go to die. Coming here is like being in one of those scenes where Don Draper takes a client (or a mistress) to a business dinner. I found it amusing being surrounded by the suits from workplaces in the area. If they allowed smoking they may as well tape a new episode. \n\nMy partner and I came for a late afternoon meal and were seated immediately for our reservation. I ordered the 'Storyteller' cocktail which was sweet strong and tasty. The lamb lollipop appetizer was just ok but the hot fried chicken sandwich made the whole experience. The chicken was tender juicy and flavored well. It was certainly spicy but not overpowering. Moreover the bacon inside has to be the best bacon I've ever eaten at a restaurant. That may sound strange but the bacon was really cooked to perfection. The sandwich came with chips on the side which complimented it well. This place is a bit pricey but fair considering the area. Service was solid the portions were good and the food came out quickly. I would certainly try this place again." u"I've had good and bad experiences here which is why I can't give them a 4. I love this spot for drinks with colleagues and brunch has been delicious but the service is almost always below average. Between waiting forever for our drinks to waiting forever for a menu to waiting forever for a refill and for our meals the wait is a common thread. Once the wait is over the food and drinks are above average but I have yet to experience a 4 star meal." u"A great spot for Happy Hour or a date.  They have a nice amount of bar seating and plenty of tables.  They have a full bar and an impressive wine selection.  The atmosphere is nice and isn't as hectic as some of the other local bars in the area.  I can't wait to return to try the burger which looked incredible!" u"This is a very big restaurant. There was no wait to be seated for Sunday brunch and there is also bar seating and additional seating downstairs. We ordered the acai bowl and the BEC in a croissant. The acai bowl had a lot of fruits but was very watery not a thick consistency at all. The BEC sandwich was good besides the bacon being a little burnt. The service was okay. Our waters were empty 90% of the time they weren't refilled until I asked for the check.\n\nThis place is definitely good for a large crowd that doesn't want to wait long. \n\nWe might return to try the chicken sandwich because the diners next to us had it and it looked really good." u'3.5 stars! \n\nCame in around 2 pm this afternoon with some friends for brunch and was not disappointed! $5 drafts and cocktails :) \n\nWe sat downstairs in their very cute downstairs barrel room which has fewer beers on tap (but I think you can still ask for beers from upstairs). The only downside of sitting downstairs is that it is adjacent to the prep kitchen and the aroma & acidity of onions being chopped resulted in many teary eyes! \n\nI had the crab cakes Benedict which was excellent. Not heavily breaded but the crab cakes themselves were flaky and thick and had great flavor. Egg was perfectly runny. It is not served on a carb (e.g. English muffin) which actually I think allowed the crab cake to stand out. The house salad it is served with was CRAZY salty and I only ate a few bites of it. \n\nMy SO ordered the chicken and waffles - DO IT. So good. Chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the waffles are dense and delicious\n\nThere were so many other items on the menu that sounded amazing that I hope we can go back some time soon to try them all!' u"Close to GCT on park ave it def caters to a business crowd. Stumbled upon this place while walking back to our hotel and thought we'd give it a try. \n\nThere were mostly only bar seats available and so ended up sitting there weird arrangement of sorts and slightly difficult to watch the tv if you're interested in a game. \n\nGot the steak tartare which didn't remotely taste anything like it and felt there was too much aioli that took away the taste of the steak. Drinks are pretty overpriced too guess its prob coz of the location and the crowd.\n\nIt's probably better to come here for brunch and they have half off on their wine bottles which is a great deal. Not sure if I'd come here otherwise on a weekend night as such." u"Upper-middle-class-tier brunching at its best. PAT stands out as one of the most pleasant adult-class eateries in the area (think mid30s and up over the mid20s-30 boozy brunches speckling the Murray Hill landscape).\n\nI pretty much had to get the best things on the menu:\n-SMOKED SALMON TOTS (exactly what it sounds like)\n-CRAB CAKE BENEDICT\n\nI highly recommend ordering the way I did. Otherwise the menu is strong with favorites like chicken 'n' waffles and shrimp 'n' grits. $5 brunch cocktails available. Service was good and the place is sane and comfortable." u'Came here again for dinner and it was a great experience. I invited 3 of my other friends to join me together and we went a little over board with the ordering lol for small plates we had the 1) mac and cheese 2) Spinach and artichoke 3)crab cakes. Really delicious and slightly heavy for appetizers. It def slowed us down for our main courses. My 3 friends all got the spicy fried chicken sandwich which is on a brioche bun! I got the soup and sandwich which was a tomato bisque and gruyere grilled cheese sandwich.  We were all STUFFED by the end of the it. What added to the experience was the lovely service! Absolutely love love loved our waiter. The manager also checked in frequently to make sure we were doing well and was also super friendly. Overall great night with an atmosphere set for great conversation over high quality food & service!!' u"Great Burgers. Great drinks. Great atmosphere. It was a little pricier than I thought it would be. The menu seems to change often (don't rely on yelp for that) but there are a few amazing staples." u"I love Park Avenue Tavern.  The place itself is very nice - they have a big inviting bar and booths and tables upstairs.  Downstairs they have a room that seems to be for private parties - I'm hoping someone will throw me a party here!\n\nThe Park Burger is as good as it gets.  Best burger I've had in NYC.  They also offer 1/2 priced bottles of (select) wine on Sundays which is a great deal.   I'll certainly be back another Sunday for some wine and a burger." u'I have stayed at a nearby hotel twice and both times I have had difficulty finding a late night place that serves food. \n\nNow we all know that NYC is the city that never sleeps but around this area most foods joints are closed after 10-11 as they cater to the local offices and retail stores as well as tourists during the daytime. Luckily PT comes to save the day ... or night? They have a dinner menu that runs until about 10 and then they switch over to a late night menu that is available until 1-2. \n\nThe food has always been solid and they have a variety of options from bar food to larger plates for those coming in late and starving like myself. They also have several TVs around the bar for those catching a late night game as well as a large selection of craft beer for pairing. \n\nPT is a great place to go to late night in the area that serves great food has a great crowd and will satisfy your bar fix without having to settle for a dingy dive bar.' u'Park Avenue Tavern is a great neighborhood spot for brunch on the weekends. They offer $5 cocktails (!!!!) and have a full range of brunch menu items from burgers to eggs to salad. \n\nI came with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. It was not nearly as crowded as compared to after work happy hour times. I had the hangover hash (eggs sausage and potatoes) and it truly was a perfect hangover cure.' u"The reviews and pictures from this place looked great so we had to try it out while waiting for our hotel room to be ready! It did not disappoint!! Immediately got seated during a busy Friday lunch hour. I had the tomato bisque & a sandwich & it was delicious! My boyfriend had a sandwich that was on special (chopped ribeye and cheese) and he loved it! Waitress was very friendly & attentive. I had the Strawberry Crush cocktail & it was soooo good! Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!" u'This is a great place for lunch.  The menu is not huge but they had plenty of brunch options.\n\nI would recommend trying the shrimp and grits it is an amazing bowl of creamy goodness.  The Mac and Cheese was pretty good too.\n\nThe server was as good as any in the City.  A manager checked on us once during the meal.  I have no complaints and I would be back if I were in the area.' u"This place is very middle of the road. It is located in prime real estate and makes the most of it by having a HUGE bar upstairs and a decent sized bar downstairs. We went for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the food. The nutella french toast was delicious but very very rich. The hangover special was very good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The bacon on the egg dish however was not crispy whatsoever which we did not love. Additionally the bathroom in the place was not well taken care of this morning: There was vomit all over one of the urinals that was not cleaned up from the night before. \nOn a plus side the mimosas were great and not watered down at all. The price is far: it's midtown manhattan so it is what you expect."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
112.Broadway Lounge & Terrace,[u"What you'd expect for lounge food and drinks with a few hidden gems. Like hummus? Their hummus is fab! I get it every time! We stay here annually in the summer (Marriott Marquis) so The Lounge is a staple and their bar eats are decent for sure." u"Time dulls memories. This used to be a fantastic meeting place with the wonderful backdrop of insane Time's Square. Now it's a depressing lounge with mediocre drinks indifferent service and sub-quality food. \nIt this is really part of the Marriott they need to re-consider branding. \nI had spent many post-meetings here entranced by the view and the service but lately it has just gone down hill. \nIt's almost a pure reflection of the commercial junk below and is not longer a refuge." u'Five minus one star = **** for slight attitude and prices (but high prices really are a given here).\n\nGlorious view from new outdoor terrace. Terrace had a few tables and chairs and some lounge-y sofas upholstered in white fabric that honestly should\'ve been upholstered in a darker color because they are already showing some wear. \n\nInside is a very spacious bar and dining area with cool light fixtures and plenty of window seats for a front row Times Square view located away from the busy reception area of the busy 8th floor of the Marriott Marquis. Truth be told I love hotel bars and this one although very touristy is a good one.\n\nOur waitress has definitely served us before a year ago so she\'s been around and is quite experienced serving tourists (and us locals alike). She\'s actually very good and offered my husband water right away when she saw him choking on a candy (he was fine). But she was not all too pleased when all we ordered was a beer and a specialty cocktail. Should I feel bad we didn\'t order dumplings or a slice of cake to go with that? \n\nThere\'s a large menu of overpriced bar snack offerings and desserts that are actually reasonably priced. We had dinner plans soon and all we wanted was to hang on a couch outside and take in the view with a boozy drink for 20 minutes. "SO JUST DRINKS? NO FOOD? NO DESSERT?"  We didn\'t think much of it and just really enjoyed our drinks scenery and people watching. \n\nWe had a lovely time. We weren\'t staying at the hotel this time but we often do as a staycation when seeing shows; my favorite pastime. We won\'t stop coming here; just note that you may get more pleasant service if you order more than 2 drinks or a burger with your beer. Enjoy the view!!! It\'s pretty great even if you\'ve seen it a million times. :)' u"Like my last review says I love this place because of the view and atmosphere. But lately I've been getting bad service. Back in January when I came here with a guy we seat for a good 10 minutes and not one waitress came to us. So we left.  Another time a friend and I set down at a table away from the window. We ordered two drinks. While waiting for the drinks a couple near the window left so we moved into their spot. Our waitress was so upset. It appears the room is divided in half which one waitress take care of the guests on one side the other waitress handle the other side. So I can understand her anger  (losing out on tip) but really a lot of people are here for the view. Accommodating guests and keeping them happy should be the motto. I was there last night. It looks like the beers have increased by a dollar. Beers are between  $8-9 now which is a reasonable price. Coming here yesterday my college friend and I discovered the terrace seating. I've been coming here almost 9 years now and yesterday was the first time I noticed the terrace. It looks like it just open. You can find it to your right behind the bar. I always recommend this place to everyone I talk to whenever they ask me a nice place to grab a drink. The service can improve though." u'Absolutely ADORE the Broadway Lounge!  It is always on my list of places to go when I plan my NYC trip.  I could eat here for every meal...  the view is breath-taking the service is fantastic and the food is wonderful!  No matter what the occasion is - visit the Broadway Lounge during your next trip to NYC!' u'The view is WONDERFUL but the service is never above average and the prices are higher than most - even for NYC. Best for just drinks.' u"Horrible service. More appropriately a complete lack thereof. Nobody came around in 20 minutes despite talking to both the hostess and a waitress. I crossed the street and went to Junior's for a sandwich. There was food and drink at my table within 5 minutes. You decide which place deserves your business." u'Great cocktails and bar bites. Love when there is live jazz music! Amazing view of Times Square from the corner seats. They also have a very cool deck outside where you can get bites and drinks! With an amazing view!! no where like it in Times Square.' u'A fun place to have a drink. Keep your eyes peeled for a window table especially on the weekends they are hard to get but worth the hunt. \nThe cocktails are pricey but with it for the ambience. The service is great. \nEvery time I come to Times Square I make time for a cocktail at this iconic bar.' u'I shared my experience with the establishment. Here is about what I wrote (names redacted):\n\nTook time to get service\nLow energy almost contempt for taking my order most certainly indifference.\nPlaced an order for food. Did not ask if I wanted anything to drink. So I asked for water.\nI asked for refill of water three times once with guy who brought my food who decided to ignore my request (he heard me acknowledged me). Then tried to flag down waitress. Finally I needed to go find her since she was not making any eye contact in my direction. And so here is where it gets really stupid. The entire time I asked for ice water. Pretty simple: Ice + water. She poured water. I had two existing ice chips floating at the top (not even cubes). So I said to her "Can I get some ice with that?"\nwaitress: "It\'s in there (referencing the existing chips)"\nMe: "but none came out."\nwaitress: "the ice is in the (her) container."\n\nThat was real stupid so I just shook my head and decided ... No ice for me tonight I guess. I disengaged. That has to be one of the smallest most idiotic conversations I ever had with a waitress. So you can see my life is not that thrilling. There was no language barrier. She spoke English so wipe that off as an excuse. \n\nTo top it off. the semi-cold glass of water and hamburger (with fries) cost me about $23. And it was not like I was paying for the experience. So the whole thing sucked.' u"First time in New York my family wanted a quick bite to eat before we walked around. The waitress wasn't mean but she wasn't very friendly either she only checked on us one time towards the end of the meal. The food is extremely over priced $10 for a small portion of chips and $20 for a burger. The wait was long. Overall would not like to come back here again was expecting a little bit better. The view however was amazing!" u"I have been going to the 8th floor of the Marriott Marquis in New York for many years. It is a convenient meeting spot for friends and family and the various seating areas and lounges are there to fit any need. \n\nI went last Wednesday with my mother and some friends to have a mini reunion and used my card to hold the tab. Our waitress was not particularly nice but not outwardly bad.\n\nWe did let her know we were going to a show later on but I was well aware as a front of house manager at a busy restaurant sometimes things get busy. We decided to let her know a half hour before we had to leave that we needed a check. She was nowhere to be found. No other servers checked on us and time was ticking by..\n\nFinally 5 minutes after we were supposed to leave a woman came by and we told her we needed to leave. It was then that we saw our server emerge and she came to drop off the check. I advised her I was paying with a different card than the one I was holding the table with because someone else at the table was paying for the meal and drinks. The card was ran and we were on our way. \n\nAs I used my card to hold the tab there was a $50 pending fee which lasted until the next day. After that however the charge turned into $64.98. Which was not only not the amount on our table but the friend who ran their card confirmed that their card was properly charged. \nSo either we were charged twice or my card was ran for someone else's table.\n\nI waited a few days to see if it would go away and it had not so I called up and spoke to management and let them know I thought that she had run our card on a different table.\n\nI explained the situation to the manager who told me the accounting department would get back to me. Two days later I haven't heard anything so I called back and left a message. This continued back and forth for the last week and a half. No one had contacted me and when I have called either left a message or am told they are not sure what I'm talking about and can't find a charge. \n\nEvery time I have to explain to them I think she ran the card on a different table and know one understands or has notes from the previous card. They all want our check number but our check number was essentially useless still I gave it every time. \n\nEither way the charge needed to come off of my card. I then went another three days without hearing anything and sent a message to the Broadway Lounge on Facebook. \n\nI want to extend a huge thanks to the social media team who responded to me almost immediately and set the wheels in motion. They were no way at fault. Just a few hours later I was contacted by the accounting department who said he spoke to my bank and there is no such charge. How does he know which bank I use if I don't have a charge?\nI asked him which bank he called and he would not tell me. \n\nHe then said I needed to call my bank and have some information faxed over. \nI told him that was fine but it was easy for him to use the last 4 digits of my card to check the credit cards ran that day and they would see which table it was ran for the amount time and server. \n\nHe kept asking me to call this person and send this fax and etcetera. Finally I lost it on him. Yes I was rude and I cursed over the phone. After a week and a half I had enough. He was in NO way offering to help me and was insinuating there was no such charge. \n\nI even sent him and the Facebook social media team a screenshot of the charge and yet nothing he could do. I have opted to leave a bad review on Yelp and I am disputing the charge with my credit card as fraud. \n\nThis was an entirely avoidable incident but no one there seems to have a clue what they're doing nor do they care. It's a shame I have always loved the 8th floor but I no longer feel comfortable giving them more money nor would I want to." u'Went here for a cocktail style company party.  Service was good as the food was refilled quickly and the staff was attentive and kept the areas tidy.  Two bars were set up.  The larger one was fully functional and had a good selection of liquors.  The smaller one only had limited stock for some drinks.  I requested an old fashioned and needed to go to the larger bar to have it made.  It was nice that the bartender had several whiskeys to choose from to make it.  The space is odd when you approach it as it seems to be tucked into a corner of the hotel but is beautiful once you are inside it.  Decor is modern with glowing orbs  hanging from above.  Besides the seating facing the main dance area there are also small nooks that face the outside where you can go for some privacy.  There are two outdoor balconies with terrific views of Times Square.  Couches were set up in each of the balconies so you can really take in the atmosphere.  Food was average at best.' u'Big great space a bit outdated and needs an overhaul but the drinks are strong and relatively well-priced. Great exposure & views and the acoustics are okay. A good place to grab a drink if you need to somehow be in the Marriott Times Square.' u"This is one of my least favorite places in Manhattan but since visitors and conference goers tend to stay in the Marriott Marquis I end up at the Broadway Lounge a couple times a year. On the upside it has a nice view of Times Square (although I prefer the view from the R Lounge a block away).  \n\nOn the downside it has all the intimacy and ambiance of a family restaurant. The chairs and tables are those sort of chrome things you'd expect to find in a Denny's. The place is cavernous and brightly lit. Service is iffy and drinks are mediocre.  \n\nIf you're staying at the Marriott with your family and want to grab a drink or bite with a good view of Times Square this place is at least convenient. Otherwise I'd strongly suggest getting out and about to explore the many other dining and drinking options nearby.  (New Yorkers will say midtown is a wasteland but there still are nice options to be found.)" u'Great view of the Times Sq but food is subpar and drinks are overpriced and not mediocre.' u"initially tried to go to The View with the parents who were visiting from out of town.  While there wasn't much in the way of a wait there was a $8 per person cover charge...so we decided to skip it.\n\nOne of the hostesses told us about the hotel bar downstairs (on the 8th floor) that actually looks out over Times Square.  It definitely hit the touristy vibe we were looking for to entertain out of town guests.\n\nDrinks are definitely expensive ($16 for cocktails etc) and the service was pretty sub par.  It does have cheese plates from Murray's cheese shop though which did really hit the spot.\n\nGreat bar? Nope - I'd prob give it 3.5 stars if I could for the location and given that it satisfied what we were looking for that night but overall I'd say better places to hit up!" u"We stayed at the Marriott for a long family weekend trip.  We visited the Broadway lounge twice.  It's a large venue with great comfortable seating.  There are a number of TVs with various sporting events on them.\n\nThe wait staff was extremely friendly.  One night we just did desserts.  My boys loved the build your own sundaes.  My wife and I split the coconut pecan cream pie.  It was out of this world.  I ended up ordering it another night as well.\n\nOn another visit we got dinner.  My boys split a pizza which was good.  I had the wedge salad which was just OK nothing special could have used more bacon.  My wife had the lamb skewers again nothing special.\n\nDrink cocktails were good.  Would recommend this place." u'Was looking for place that was opened late and found Broadway lounge that closes at 11pm on Saturday.   We just had desserts and appetizers.  Place was comfortable and not that loud wait staff were busy  but still accounting .' u'When all is said and done here it is a noisy crowded place with dramatically overpriced food and drinks. It could benefit from a full reanalysis of its purpose in the hotel. I would certainly gravitate to a quieter space. Service seems to be based on how you are dressed.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
130.Pizzarte,[u"When landing in New York was dying for a really good slice of pizza. Was around the avenue of the Americas and found this little gem. Had high recommendations on yelp so we decided to check It out. What seemed like the manager or owner greeted us very much as if we had just landed in Italy itself. I love spicy food so the waiter (Gennaro-real nice guy) helping us recommended the d\xedavola pizza. My mouth waters just thinking about It. It was amaaaazing ! If you're a pepperoni lover or spicy food lover try It ! You won't regret It ! \n\nBtw: try and leave some space for dessert..\nThe tiramisu is PHENOMENAL" u'There has only been a handful of places that mimic the true taste texture and consistency of an authentic Naples pie (I mean even northern Italy can\'t get it right..). Pizzarte is one of one. It is one of 3 establishments in North America (that I\'ve experienced) that gets it right.\n\nI won\'t go in depth on the actual pizza review because there are hundreds of reviews below mine that will give you an in depth look at what it tastes like. Even the negative reviews are positive in my opinion. The criticisms of this pie is that it has a soupy consistency layered on weak dough....which while is a bit of a stretch of a description..it is the authentic Naples texture. I love it. I can\'t get enough of it. The staff is very knowledgeable and has a deep understanding of the cultural around their product.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered 2 pies and the calamari starter.\nThe calamari was not really just calamari..to our surprise it contained shrimp and fried zucchini as well which was a great touch. The seafood tasted really really fresh and the breading had a great subtle flavor that didn\'t kill the fresh taste of the seafood. My only compliant is that it was saturated in leftover oil. While it wasn\'t overly fried I wish they would have dropped out the oil before serving it.\n\nThe pizzas as mentioned were delicious. My Diavola was the perfect blend of chopped meats cheese and a smooth tomato sauce. Chunky tomato paste or sauce/marinara is cheap..this place does it right.\n\nThe only other compliant with this establishment is the "Manhattan Tax". For a personal pizza and calamari starter and a diet Coke I was charged near 45 dollars. I miss the days in Naples where that would have all been under $10 USD at Da Michele or any other number of iconic restaurants. \n\nRegardless still a fantastic place to check out if you want true authentic Naples pizza' u"If you love acentic Italian Naples food. You have to try this place!..  Dario and Bruno (owner) opened 5-7 years ago with a goal to bring fresh ingredients and undiscovered wine directly from Italy! \nFood service and hospitality is impeccable! They even let my young kids make his own pizza! I know the owners so don't expect to make your own pizza :) \nBut I wouldn't be surprised if they let you!" u'I was torn between the pizza and the pasta and wanted the "lighter" option if you could call pizza "light." Plus there was a lovey looking stone fired pizza oven in the bottom floor so that kind of swayed me. \n\nThe place seems to employ real live Italians which I can vibe with as an Italian myself! But more importantly I can only assume it\'s a family of Italians running the place (or just think that to make the story of Italians running the place to make it more legit in my mind!). Plus you get complimentary olives in a fantastic tasting olive oil... with bread so that\'s extra Italian points!\n\nI ordered the signature Pizzarte pizza which is butternut squash Italian sausage and burrata. I actually wanted the pizza because of the butternut squash and was a little bummed to see only a few small pieces on it. It was still pretty tasty with the spicy sausage and burrata so that\'s why I\'m rating it high still. \n\nThe only other complaint I had was that my negroni had too much compari. It\'s my drink of choice and while complaint is what makes the drink it also ruins it and makes it too sweet if there\'s too much. \n\nService was friendly and communicative too since we hopped in with no reservations and had a short wait. Again I would definitely come back and maybe try the pasta!' u"The pizzas come out fast. I expected to wait forever to get my lunch but apparently the oven is hot enough to bake a pizza in less than ten minutes.\n\nThe dough was decent but the sauce was super watery soaking through the dough and making the pizza into a mess that you could only eat with a spoon. The cheese was great though.\n\nStaff are all pretty bored to be there; I don't expect Chuck-E-Cheese levels of liveliness from a pizza joint but they all looked like they hated their life." u"Wasn't at all impressed with the pizza. Oil base and sparing toppings. The servers seemed more concerned about having us order more food and drinks and dessert then to address our room temperature water. Seldom is the time where I am unimpressed by both the food and the service so to see that be the case here was surprising to me.\nBut being near time square and hungry for some pizza we gave it a shot. That's all it'll get.\n'Til next time NY." u'On our first night in NYC and we came back to this place. We had another bottle of wine different from the first time here It was really good better than the first time. We sat at the bar Gennaro helped us choosing what to eat everything was perfect. Our night my hubby and I we had a perfect night with his suggestions . Awesome  I would say :)... definitely we are coming back next time we are in NYC' u'This is the best restaurant in Manhattan. Also amazing service. You feel that you are in a restaurant in Italy. The only complain is that you cannot make changes to the menu I.e. you cannot order one pasta with different sauce or add an ingredient. Other than that it is definitely worth trying. Best pasta pizza and tiramisu in Manhattan.' u'Came here with my dad for a non-stuffy non-white tablecloth but high quality midtown brunch. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be eating the pizza. It was also a great sign the three people next to us were Italians straight from Italy and only speaking in Italian.\n\nI ordered the proscuitto and melon appetizer special which was three HUGE slices of melon with not enough proscuitto to compliment it. Not filling enough to be a main and a bit overpriced at $17. I also had the meatballs which had broccoli rabe and pine nuts. They were very good but the marinara sauce tasted like it was from the can. My dad seemed to enjoy his pizza and although as expensive as some white table cloth places its definitely a solid midtown option.' u"Food: 3.0/5.0\nService: 3.0/5.0\nValue: 3.0/5.0\nDecor: 3.0/5.0\nOverall: 3.0/5.0 \n\nI want to like this place but have to say that I'm not feeling the pizza here.  Granted I have not tried the rest of the menu but given the name...  Planning to give it another shot though I could have run into an off day." u"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a weeknight. This is a pretty new spot so we were able to be seated right away upstairs. The dining room is railroad style as it is essentially one long hallway.\n\nAfter perusing the menu we decide to split a few dishes:\n\nBolognese (3 stars): Just your average bolognese. The noodles are interesting but otherwise pretty plain.\n\nPizzarte pizza (4.5 stars): This was absolutely delicious. I don't know if I have had pizza in NYC that I enjoyed as much as this as it really provided a great flavor combination.\n\nRed snapper (4 stars): This dish was cooked well and had nice flavor. Not a huge portion but sufficient.\n\nBroccoli rabe (3.5 stars): Sometimes broccoli rabe can be very bitter but this place was able to impart some flavor into it which made for a nice bite.\n\nFlourless chocolate almond cake (3 stars): Did not know what to expect from this combination and am still not sure exactly what flavor profile they were going for.\n\nOverall this place serves up some amazing pizza. The rest of the dishes seem to be pretty hit or miss but their namesake pizza was delicious. Definitely be sure to check it out if you stop in. Service was friendly and attentive and food came out at a decent pace. Not too loud inside which is great for a date or catch up with a friend." u'First timers and we loved it! We had pasta for entree; their fettuccini is fresh and authentic. The service was exceptional!! We sat by the door (at the bar) and without telling them the manager/owner turned on the heater where we instantly felt nice and warm. Really sweet friendly and also speak Italian. Made me feel like I was in Italy. Excited to return and try their Pizza!' u"Omggg amazing pizza here! Just kinda stumbled across this place it's a little small but super cute and has a nice little swanky touch. Good cocktails and good food. Two pizzas for two people and we ate every last bite! - the capricciosa and tartufata. So delicious!!" u"We got a tip from a friend on where to go for good gluten free food in the Theater District and they recommended this place. We came and the gluten free pizza was truly outstanding! Hard to believe it was gluten free.\n\nThe place is really small though so there is not a lot of extra room. Mainly everyone sits up at the counter which is like a big bar. There is a table up front but it was full when we got here. I'd imagine this place gets full fast most evenings.\n\nThe people were very friendly and helpful with the menu. Lots of drink selections are available here too including many good wines." u"Very good for the whole family.  My wife doesn't eat gluten so she had the margarita gluten free and really couldn't tell the difference between that and the one my kids had which to me speaks on the level of how good it was.  \n\nI had the chicken dish that had a garlic and butter spread that came out on the side which just put the dish over the top.  \n\nGood atmosphere in there as well." u'The food was very fresh and tasty. Wait staff very helpful and over welcoming! Prices very very reasonable' u"Lovely restaurant on the West side close to Broadway and Times Square. If your looking for a gluten free option for pizza make sure you check this place out.\n\nI still love to see people dressed for lunch or dinner I think that's why they attract that crowd. It's definitely a sleek Italian vibe with their white decor sexy music and good looking staff.\n\nNice variety of pizza pasta and secondi entrees.\n\nI opted for the spinaci salad and the al pomodoro pasta. The spinaci had thin sliced beets pistachio goat cheese and mango- loved the twist of mango especially on these hot NY days. Al pomodoro pasta was tasty with its long thick pasta! Served with enough pomodoro sauce to wipe the pasta bowl clean!\n\nA variety of dolci- opted for the mixed berry sorbet. If you want to people watch some beautiful guests as well as the staff- try Pizzarte you'll also love all the pizza's being made if you sit at the bar!" u"Their Gluten Free Pizza and Gluten Free Focaccia is EVERYTHING! It's the most delicious thing I've ever eaten and I'm not exaggerating. I've ordered it every day for the past week and I actually get it with no cheese but put roasted red peppers and olives on top. And they have delicious olive oil and spicy olive oil to dip the crust in. \nFor those of you who crave bagels garlic bread and sandwiches but need to eat Gluten free try the crust with different toppings (Ive done vegan butter and poppy seeds vegan butter and garlic etc)\nENJOY!! They get 5 stars for their food but 3 stars for their service - so that's why I have them 4 stars" u"Cute spot. Artsy Italian restaurant. I got the Montanara pizza with sausage. Just perfect. I love Gourmet pizza and wine... it's my fav!" u"Pizzarte's signature pie is one of my favorites--I love the combination of the butternut squash sausage and burrata! Mmm it's so good!! I just wish it wasn't so pricey so that I could  enjoy it more often! I also like their margherita pie and that they do gluten free pies since I have a few friends who are gluten free"],0.836,0.344,0.656,0.0
21.Ootoya Times Square,[u"Awesome tonkatsu! I have been wanting to come here for awhile and finally was able to right after work. This place opens at 5:30 and there's typically line out the door with people who already have reservations waiting to eat! I called the day before and was able to snag a 5:30 reservation. There was actually quite a bit of room inside the restaurant.\n\nI got the miso tonkatsu and the tonkatsu was perfectly fried. The pork was juicy and tender and the outer shell was nice and crispy. The miso seasoning was good with a hefty amount of cabbage.I got the set and it paired well the rice. Miso soup was also tasty.\n\nOverall a great place for Japanese food. Definitely worth a try." u"Pricey but authentic quality soba.\n\nOotoya's interior replicates more upscale izakayas in Japan pretty well. I sat at the bar because it was the only spot available and I think my experience at Ootoya felt more authentic because I was at the bar.\n\nI would come back to try other items on the menu.\n\n-- \ntaste / 4\naesthetics / 4\nvibe / 5\nservice / 4\nprice for quality / 3\nOVERALL / 4" u"Went back again earlier this week and food still tasted amazing! Service is still mediocre. I would give them 5 stars for consistency both I high food quality and meh service.\n\nI tried their udon and omg it's so good! I'm usually not a big fan of udon as a lot of times restaurants make them so soggy. But not at ootoya their udon has the right texture sort of like al dente but a little bit chewy. Just the way I like it. And the broth was so flavorful. Even tho there's not meat in the noodle soup it tastes so rich.\n\nI also tried their daily special which was a grilled fish flown in from Japan. As always it's good as well. Their Gyu Yakitori was really good! The beef was so tender and juicy melts in your mouth. \n\nOverall a very satisfying meal. And I'm looking forward to going back there again. Even though their waiters are not the best their food will keep me going back!" u"I'm so sad that they take away the egg from A la carte...but everything is just perfect and you can't complain. Their pork chop is something you should never miss and it goes well with all kinds of sauces and dishes." u"A real Japanese izakaya right in the heart of NYC. It reminded me of the places we went when we were in Japan both in ambiance and in food flavor/quality/service. These guys know what they're doing.\n\nWe sat at the bar towards the back near the yakitori grill. Our server was excellent - very attentive knows the dishes and pronounced them accurately (if that matters to you). I ordered the potato croquette and the mini maguro don set. Glad I didn't get more as I had to sample my family's dishes too. :-)  The tonkatsu was out of this world - light crispy outer without too much grease and tender juicy pork inside. We got one skewer of gyu (beef) was good but nothing amazing. The Tori Kurozu An (fried chicken with a sweet and sour sauce) was also delicious. The pickled veggies miso soup and rice were nice accompaniments.\n\nA bit pricey for the amount of food yeah. But it was worth it - high quality ingredients and great service. Highly recommend you make a reservation or you'll be waiting a long time." u"Hands down favorite Japanese comfort food place in the city. There is usually a rather long wait so come early to at least put your name down!\n\nOpen kitchen very clean and great service by the wait staff. Also they are a tipping free restaurant - in line with Japanese culture. \n\nFood can be ordered in a set which includes some side dishes i.e. Miso soup pickled veggies egg custard (deliciously smooth!) etc or it can be ordered a la carte. I suggest the set which has great value for the money and quality of food you get. \n\nSome of my personal favorites are the kimchi hot pot - if you're in the mood for something soupy and flavorful and comforting. There is a variety yakitori set that you get to try several of their highlights. Their grilled fish sets are awesome too. The fish is always fresh and clean. For appetizers their homemade tofu is worth a try. I like regular tofu you but at the store this tastes so organic and fresh and fluffy you won't believe it's tofu you're eating. Have a try and you won't look at tofu the same!" u"One of my favorite Japanese places in the city! The ambiance service and food are on par. I only waited 15 mins. to be seated at the bar for lunch. The staff was really friendly and very open to offering me suggestions based on my food preferences. They are a non-tipping establishment so I think for the area prices are very reasonable.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick lunch check out their bento boxed lunches which are conveniently sold next to their front entrance. They did sell out by 1:30pm on the weekday that I went so head over early if you're interested in trying!" u'Otooya is a sleek Japanese restaurant where the specialty is the grilling of animal flesh. We came here for lunch on a Monday it was fairly full. \n\nThe marinated beef is very savory and is kept warm on a heated platter. \n\nMashed potato which accompanies the beef is served somewhere between cool to cold. \n\nThe egg custard is warm and salty not sweet. \n\nThe miso soup also has notes of salt and was delicious. \n\nIt is clear that considerable thought and effort has gone into the presentation of the meal.' u'This was an amazing experience.  Every dish was prepared perfectly with great pride.  These folks need to seriously open up in San Francisco where we come from.  No tipping too!  In an age where some restaurants even suggest 25-30% putting the burden of paying their workers on the customer these owners get it.' u'Very nice place to eat. Warm environment and nice music. Definitely recommend here. I would like to go again no matter what' u"Wifi: N/A\nService/Staff: 5/5\nVegetarian/Vegan friendly?: 2/5\nFood: 4/5\nReservations?: Yes\nPrice (for dinner): $ for NYC $$.$ regular\nWorth it? 4/5 Yes for the experience\n\nReally gives up authentic Japanese vibes really cute dishes and nice presentation! Really crowded so reservations are probably better than just showing up and great service! Definitely have unique dishes that aren't in normal Japanese resutrants" u"Went here for a late date night good location and the decorations of the restaurant is very eye catching. \n\nFood : wow I ordered the salmon dinner set. It was the best grilled salmon that I've ever eaten so far. Plus the set is so cute. \n\nService : very good attentive and they are all friendly. \n\nYou will eat authentic Japanese food in here that's for sure!" u"I was in New York on business and really craving Japanese food. I came here on the first night hoping to get the same quality of food that I can get at Ootoya in Japan.\n\nI arrived here a little after 5:30pm and there were already many groups here. I sat down at the counter and asked if they had hot green tea. The staff said yes so I ordered it. I got my drink. I had a sip. It wasn't green tea. Hmmm.\ni ordered mini kaisendon as I didn't want to eat a lot but mini kaisendon was very disappointing. I only got about 7 pieces of okay quality sashimi. Miso soup wasn't bad but chawanmushi was watery.  Hakusai no tsukemono was bland. \nI was very disappointed in my food because I really wanted to like this place. I rather just go to Ootoya in Japan or other Japanese restaurants. \n\nThe service was okay. Nothing great and can be improved. The prices weren't great but hey It's New York. \nI won't come back here." u'Stopped in on a Friday evening around 8pm we called ahead to see if there was a long wait but I think with rainy weather we lucked out only a 10 minute wait.\n\nWe were able to get a table for 2 inside as opposed to on the bar or around a U shaped yalitori bar area wish I had taken a picture.  It was relatively quiet and accessible to the waitress.\n\nWe started off with the Mini Tori Kurozu which is fried chicken with vegetables served with Ootoya famous "sweet and sour" vinegar sauce ($8).  The chicken had good flavor and not too salty the sauce was pretty good as well.  I wish I was a little more adventurous!\n\nWe had a nice pitcher of Asahi which was nice and cold $22\n\nI had the Miso Tonkatsu Set $26 silky pork loin breaded and fried.  It\'s a pork cutlet with a rich Aka Miso gravy with a poached egg.  Rice comes on the side.   The cutlets were crispy and juicy!  It was a very delicious dish I wish there was more haha!\n\nMy girlfriend had a Grilled Mackerel Hooke Yuan Set $27. It came with grated radish made fresh when the order is taken.  The fish was very nice with great flavor not salty.  The sauce that comes with the fish is nice.  It also came with pumpkin with was very delist.\n\nThe set is a great deal you get miso soup (relish)m homemade pickles and the famous Steamed Egg Custard. \n\nOverall Ootoya provides solid experience every time I go been there 4 times.  If you are in the Times Square you don\'t have a lot of options mostly tourists traps I would highly recommend this place.\n\nIf you\'re looking for traditional Japanese food good value for what you pay pretty good service that requires no additional tip this is your place!\n\nEnjoy!!' u"I have been meaning to try this place for a while. If you come for lunch try getting here before noon before the crowds floods in. \n\nMy favorites were \n\n- Hokke Yuan set - excellent mackerel with slightly sweet ponzu sauce. I love the chawamushi and pumpkin with it. Didn't care for the pickled vegetables and radishes (can't get this to taste good even with soy sauce).\n\n- homemade tofu. Definitely some of the best tofu I have tasted. Even better than some of the small Japanese spots in San Francisco. \n\nWe also ordered the natto with our lunch. A bit strong so best to have it with rice. The waitress recommended some mustard and soy sauce with it." u'Love this place because it is very suitable for eating alone at lunch break. The place is crowded and usually it takes 20minutes to wait for a seat. They also offer take away at noon very convenient and fast.' u"Pretty good Japanese restaurant around Time Sq.  We had lunch there and had the Oyako Don with Soba the sauce for the don was at the right level not too salty nor swamping the rice.  Chicken was juicy not too dry.  \n\nThis place can get busy at lunch time we were there around 1145am Monday it's already packed and waited for around 10 minutes.  Line got longer after us when we left at around 1pm." u'Just finished drinks at a nice bar in Bryant Park with a large group of friends and we all wanted something to eat. Our friend from NYC suggested this place because it was a close walk and could accommodate our large group for dinner. First thing I noticed when we sat down was the small print on the menu stating "Ootoya is a non-tipping restaurant". WHOA?!? That\'s a first in the states...never seen that before...how interesting. Wonder what service is going to be like? Luckily service was fine and we didn\'t have any issues other than we had so many people that a few orders were given to the wrong person but that was corrected with a simple move. \n\nItems are ordered as a set or a la carte. The set was served with rice miso soup pickled veggies and a steamed egg custard. I ordered the Salmon Sushi set. It was pressed salmon sushi three different ways with 2 pieces each. It was good but more like a snack for me. I really liked the steamed egg custard. Soft and silky with a light umami flavor. Husband ordered the Kaisen Don and sister ordered the Mini Kaisen Don set with assorted fish. They liked their food but portion was not enough for my husband...he eats ALOT! Most people in the group enjoyed their food but several said they wouldn\'t get the set next time since they felt it was a waste as they didn\'t eat most of the items that came with it.' u"This place can be really packed during the weekends so I would advise you to come during weekdays (mon-thurs) My friend and I came here on a Friday night around 7pm and it was packed. We waited a little over an hour for our table.\n\nThe menu is a bit complex and hard to understand so it was hard to decide on what to order. For appetizers I decided to try the Mini tori Kurozu ($8) which is basically a sweet and sour flavored karage (chicken) and my friend ordered the mini yuan ($6) which is a side salmon. For our main course we ordered the Tororo Oyako-don which is a bed of rice with a layer of egg on top that has green onions topped with chicken. It was okay wouldn't really recommend though because it's a pretty basic dish for an overly charged price ($21 just the dish not set) and my friend had the mini negitori which is a really small bowl with rice and meat ($22) so not worth it. \n\nThe food here is pretty good I would say but it's definitely not worth it for the price you pay. The portions are super small and it's just not filling. \n\nWe also got the dessert bento box which I have to admit is pretty good. The bento box comes with matcha ice cream some jello and yuzu cheesecake. The matcha ice cream is bomb!\n\nSo overall if you're looking for a place to fill you up while  on a budget I would advise you to go somewhere else. This place has some pretty good japanese cuisine but it's just too expensive. I was so shook when looking at my bill but I guess it was for the experience. Prob won't ever come back tho don't got the money for it." u"I wanted to love this place as I went based on recommendations from my Japanese coworkers. Sadly Ootoya did not live up to my expectations. \n\nI will say I like the concept of the restaurant. It feels very authentic Japanese with the menu and how the food is served. I wish there were more Japanese restaurants in the U.S. like this instead of all the Asian fusion places. \n\nI went in for lunch around 2:30pm. Since I was eating by myself and I didn't feel like waiting for a table I took the only empty seat at the bar. In retrospect I wish I had waited for a table because my seating was a big reason as to why my experience wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. My seat was right next to the narrow entry of the restaurant so people were constantly going in and out and getting too close for comfort. \n\nI got the mini salmon don and the special drink the Sakura cocktail made with sparkling peach wine and pickled cherry blossoms. The drink was delicious but the food left much to be desired. \n\nThe salmon wasn't the worst but it didn't taste very fresh. The sushi rice didn't have any flavor. My meal also came with soba noodles pickled vegetables miso soup and steamed egg custard (which I personally cannot stomach). Everything was okay but nothing stood out to me. \n\nI'm not giving a lower rating because I feel like I went in an off day. While I didn't have the best experience I would still be willing to go to Ootoya again and try one of their other dishes. Next time I would go for one of the cooked dishes because it doesn't seem like sushi and sashimi is their strong point."],0.2937,0.13,0.787,0.083
56.Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,[u'First time in NYC Japanese Gyu kaku\nIt was very interesting and fun we got premium two and tried as much as we can best meats I have ever had and well presented and delicious and atmosphere is nice and crowded \nRecommend to make a reservation' u'Gyukaku is always a great time and although I usually go to the one by Astor my trip to this location was no different. When we first arrived we asked for a table for 4 and were told the wait was going to be 45 minutes. However we were seated within 5 minutes and the restaurant was even able to accommodate an extra guest.\n\nI believe the sets are the most cost-effective way to go here (also happy hour specials are BOMB) but we threw that out the window and individually ordered what everyone was craving. The menu is pretty extensive but feel like all of the dishes (minus the beef tongue...bleh...) are delicious if you dip them in the spicy sauce. \n\nIf you are vegetarian highly recommend getting corn (comes in a little tin and is doused in butter) for the grill and mixing it with the Vegetable Garlic Noodles (both are so yummy)!! I also tried the Beef Sukiyaki Bimbambap last time and if the Veg Bimbambap is even close to that it should be really good.' u"Gyu Kaku is a must if you're looking for a great fun meal whether it's before a Broadway show or while visiting Times Square. \n\nCome ready to share and try a bunch of different dishes. The skirt steak hangar steak and garlic ribeye are my personal faves for the cook your own meats. Oh and definitely get the s'mores for a fun dessert!\n\nTip: if you can come during happy hour to enjoy 1/2 off drinks and really great discounts for lunch or dinner. Love this place." u"Even though this place is in tourist trap central Great bang for the buck especially during happy hour! Service was great the steady flow of meats to grill were paced nicely and plenty. We chose the meat lovers set A for 2 Japanese sausage an order of their 1/2 pound harami steak and mushroom medley. Their crispy fries and roe aioli is crazy addictive and my kids got a kick out of being able to grill without much assistance the most. The staff was really friendly and helpful in making selections that were kid friendly and just enough to fill us up with very little leftover.\n \nEnding the night with S'mores and some mochi ice cream was also a big hit as well! Will definitely be back for sure!" u"Really amazing place to have dinner with friends. The staff is super friendly and the food is incredible! Love cooking my own food because it's totally experiential and makes for something different than the average night out where you just sit around doing nothing until the food arrives.\n\nI ordered the amazing Harami 1/2 pound of beef and joined the rewards program so that its worth coming back again and again! Awesome place and amazing food!!" u"Really nice restaurant. Went there with my mom and sister and it was their first time trying Japanese BBQ.\nThe service was quick and efficient.\nThe food was delicious. The staff is very helpful and they inform you how to use the grill.\nWe also celebrated my mom's birthday there so they made a surprise and brought a cake and the whole staff celebrated with us.\nI lied this place and I would visit again for sure." u'1st time having Japanese BBQ and it was very delicious. \n1. Unlike (most) Korean BBQ this place does not have all-you-can eat option... and so if you are very hungry this can become quite expensive.\n2. Unlike Korean BBQ this place you do the cooking on the grill entirely. The staff only comes to change up/switch the grill piece for a clean one. ***This made us burn 2 of our 7 or 8 meat dishes (because we didn\'t pay close enough attention).\n\nFood: all the meats (cuts of beef pork etc.) were fresh and high-quality. \nTakoyaki - I felt that I\'ve had better. Beef sukiyaki bibimbap - I really enjoyed. Garlic chicken noodle - meat was too broken; I don\'t recommend this "bestseller".\n\nAmbience: beautiful modern trendy and spacious.\n\nService: wait staff were friendly and attentive the host however was not.' u'The ambiance reminded us of being in Japan - from the way they greeted you to the dining room and service.  We ordered some apps and also some items to grill.  The bbq portion of the food was ok and not sure i would order it again.  However the prepared food was really good.  I specially enjoyed the salmon app (Hot oil seared salmon) along with the potstickers as well as the spicy tuna tacos.  The Tuna Poke was good  but lacked a little kick/flavour.\n\nThe location is also great within walking distance to times square and all of the shows in the area.\n\nWorth a try if you are in the area.' u"I was soooo excited when I found a BBQ spot since we do not have any in Jacksonville that I know of. This did not disappoint! If you have not dined in at a Japanese or Korean BBQ joint I suggest you do so!\n\nThis was a tad pricey but I knew what I was getting into. In the last spot I tried in Japan it was laid out as an all you can eat and you get up and grab the food you want to cook. However this one you had to choose the meats and they'll bring them to you. \n\nWe chose a two person special that was $80. Several appetizers and meats intertwined with a unique dining experience. Linik our server was very personable and helpful and helped us obtain $10 off with the app as well as an extra meat entree. This came with a s'mores dessert! Also a birthday ice cream along with a song came out at the end for Luke! \n\nLoved this spot so much so I'm glad we were able to add this to our itinerary. Thank you everyone for making our Friday night dinner memorable! I will be keeping Luke's birthday crown!" u"Love love LOVE Gyu-Kaku! We went on a Saturday night at 8pm and there were 10 of us that went. We had a great time! It is loud and lively inside! On a Saturday night they try to give you a 2 hour window - which seems rushed but everything comes out so quickly the 2 hours is all you need! We went over our time by about a half an hour but they didn't rush us out. \n\nFood and drinks - drinks were amazing the Asian mist and Mango Mai Tai are sweet but delicious ! We all got the package which was $35 each and includes plenty of food! We got the strip steak toro beef pork belly beef tongue just to name a few - you start with an appetizer soup and salad. The Tuna poke was amazing as was the garlic rice! The marinated skirt steak is by far THE BEST!! Omg! \n\nThe bill came out to about $65 each with tax tip and a few rounds of drinks!  Well worth the money! Will definitely go back! \n\nHappy Eating!\nNicole" u"Came for lunch on a week day around noon. We had a reservation online because we were on our lunch break and wanted to be seated right away. However the place was pretty empty when we got there and no reservation was needed at all. The lunch specials are pretty good and they have early happy hour 11:20-5/6(ish) on weekdays so everything is cheaper. All the meats we had were good and fresh. The service was also some of the best I've had in New York -- attentive friendly but not intrusive. \n\nThe first Gyu-kaku I went to was in Miami but I'm glad to have experienced it again." u'They have an amazing HH menu and I enjoyed my time here however...I am giving 1 star because one of their bar tenders swapped my credit card with someone else\'s. When I realized I had the wrong card I was blocks away and had to turn around cancel my plans and walk back to the restaurant. Really inconvenient especially since this was on a Saturday night.\n\nWhen I returned the strangers credit card that I was given the manager said she\'d call me after her shift to let me know if my card was found. I never received a call. I had to call 3 times the next morning to see if they found it and of course they didn\'t. They refunded my $7 drink at the bar but didn\'t even offer to comp my meal for their terrible mistake! Instead the manager (who I finally got on the phone with) told me "you can cancel your card we didn\'t find it". I won\'t be returning.' u"I've never been to a Japanese BBQ place ever. The most Japanese food I've ever had was sushi and teriyaki. But boy oh boy was I pleasantly surprised when my friend took me to the Times Square location. This place was AMAZING and the staff was 10/10 and the interior was 9/10. We chose Meat Lovers from the A la carte menu which includes 3 sides (miso soup fries with cod fish sauce and salad) and beef sukiyaki bibimbap. Everything and I mean everything was DELICIOUS. For the BBQ grill items we chose Set B since I'm allergic to shellfish. We loved all the meats except the Yaki-Shabu Beef Miso which is the last thing we ate and it just tasted a bit salty for us. We ordered two additional sides which was the Pork Sausage Fried Rice (utter perfection) and the Kobe Style Sirloin Steak which was also (utter perfection). \n\nFor dessert I was surprised with Birthday Vanilla ice cream w/ chocolate syrup which was also really good. They sprinkled something on it that gave it a little crunch and it was really good.  We also tried s'mores because I have never had it. Yes I know what never had s'mores but I enjoyed it. Probably would get it again just to try it there because I ended up taking mines home. \n\nI recommend meat and seafood lovers to this place. You will not be disappointed. \n\nFood 10/10 even though I didn't like the Yaki-Shaby Beef Miso. \n\nWill be coming back in October." u"Gyu-kaku is one of my fav chained restaurants. Reasonable price great food good service great drink options especially their cocktails. I've been there countless times but enjoyed every single time I went. Always ordered one of their featured cocktails and tried some limited time dishes." u"It was my second time visiting this Gyu-Kaku location. I had dinner here during my first visit. It was good and I was stuffed. For the second time I joined a friend's birthday celebration after dinner. I was right on time for enjoying s'more. It was so fun that I grilled marshmallow on the grill myself. It reminded me of doing camp fire s'more.\n\nThe service was okay. I asked the waiter to bring a glass and reminded him at least 3 times after he brought it." u'This place really never disappoints. Stopped by for lunch on a Thursday right before a client site visit and only had about an hour. Took only 5mins to be seated (3ppl party at 12:30pm) and we let the server know that we needed the check before 1:20. Ordered food came out in a timely fashion (fresh and amazing as always ) as did the check and we made it to our meeting without a hitch. \n\nTLDR; great service. Get the green tea crepe cake. That is all.' u"I always pass by Gyu Kaku on my way home and have constantly been intrigued by their extensive happy hour menu. I decided to come in with three other friends for lunch at 1:30 PM on a Thursday. We were seated right away and did not have to wait at all. \n\nOne of my friends was vegetarian so she ordered separately. The rest of us shared a Fuji BBQ Course. There are lots of options to be chosen  and it was nice being able to feel like you were customizing your meal. Even though Fuji is typically for 2 people and we had three they just gave us an extra bowl of miso soup. The only main issue with ordering the set with 3 people instead of 2 was that the portion is set so I personally felt like it was not enough food for me. Additionally the flavor was ok but didn't truly wow me but they put a lot of sauce on every entree and I personally would have liked them to let the meat themselves shine through. \n\nAfterwards the set came with smores but my friend and I also split a lava cake. The cake came with two scoops of ice cream that were good but the lava cake itself was just ok.  \n\nHowever there was lots of area to move around in and the seats were very wide and comfy which was a plus for us. Though it wasn't the best bbq I have ever been to it was still an adequate experience. But I'm not sure when I will be back next ." u"My group and I stopped in on a Saturday night for dinner. We didn't have reservations so they told us it would be a 40 minute wait. It took just about that time. We were sat in a private room that had another small party in it. I was glad we were in there as it seemed to be the brightest part of the whole restaurant. \nWe ordered several different meats rice soup and kimchi. Note: rice is not free. \nThe food was very good. The meat portions were just too small in my opinion. They give you a good portion of rice and kimchi for the price though. \nService was pretty quick with getting us what we wanted. \n\nThis is not a place where they cook the meat for you. They give you tongs to cook yourself (which I prefer anyways)\n\nAll in all. Good food good service. Worth trying out!" u'This place was delicious and awesome.  They let you cook on the built-in grill at each table and the meat was delicious.  Great location near Times Square.' u"I stumbled by here on a friend's recommendation.  I am not really into hanging out around time square for a variety of reasons.  I was convinced to come here because of the cheap drinks.  The drinks were cheap alright and disgusting.  I wouldn't order any drinks off the menu.  Just stick to your basic alcohol and soda mix straight up or on the rocks.  I ordered several appetizers and they were passable. \n\nThey have very limited seating around the bar but they do have 2 standing tables with high chairs. Not my kind of place unless I work around the area.  Gets very crowded."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
6.R Lounge at Two Times Square,[u'This Place is a hidden gem! Located right in the heart of the Times Square with glass walls all around it feels that you are seated right at the Times Square sipping cocktails with the magnificent TSQ billboards and the NYC yellow cabs. The location is as good as it can be! \n\nThe menu here (for food and drinks) is very limited. Some finger food options in the menu would have been good. Roasted red pepper hummus and pita are really decent. The veg margarita pizza is okay. The molten chocolate is yumm!! Cocktails are tasty and well made. Port Royal was my fav.\n\nI take away one star because staff here is a bit rude. They can be pretty unresponsive and ignorant at times which can really put you off especially when you have such a nice buzz!' u"I like that R Lounge is hidden in Times Square as it's at the top of the Renaissance Hotel.  Because of how hidden it is - the place isn't packed which is especially nice given that it's right in the middle of a tourist area.  Therefore the main reason why people visit R Lounge is for the view of Times Square.  The R Lounge is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows so the views are awesome especially at night.  You can see all the lit up buildings and feel like you're part of Times Square without ever setting foot outside.  \n\nWith that said - the place racks up the prices because of its location.  Cocktails will cost you a pretty penny and the slightly-elevated bar food is expensive.  We only came for a cocktail just to experience the setting.  I ordered Love Potion which is a mix of Malibu Rum muddled strawberries and other liqueurs.  I wasn't a fan of it; the drink was too sweet to my liking and the coconut rum just didn't mesh well with the strawberries.  \n\nI'd recommend this place for a post-dinner date as the lighting is dark and decor is savvy and modern.  Overall this is a fine place for the views so stay for a drink or two." u"This bar is a hidden gem and I am glad that my friends in NY took me to this place. It is located in the Renaissance Hotel in Times Square. Just head up the elevator to the lounge and head towards the windows where you have a perfect view of Times Square. Luckily we were able to sit next to the windows and have some drinks and appetizers while people watching down below. I can imagine how crowded this place would be for New Year's. \n\nOverall the food and drinks were good (well priced) but you are here obviously for the view. It was interesting to see children in the lounge but maybe I am not used to it coming from Seattle. If you are looking for a place to unwind while in Times Square definifely check out R Lounge." u'By far the best view of time square. We stayed here for two nights before heading to France. We ordered some wings and cocktail and enjoyed the view of the city. Great place to hangout with friends. Prices ok drinks and food is reasonable for the area. Cocktails were good and the waitress was friendly.  Great place to take photo of time square at night.' u"Loved this place! \n\nMade reservations for 9pm on a Saturday. When we arrived we were immediately seated by the window. View is spectacular! Limited food menu we got the chicken. Priciest chicken ever! But at least it was good.\n\nDH and I got a bottle of champagne and settled in for a little while. Service was great. \n\nWe'll be back next time we are in NYC!" u'Came through here on the way to my room one night. The view is worth the over priced drinks: Kettle chips are a must try! The atmosphere is luxurious and classy. Highly recommend.' u'To begin with the view is amazing and worth coming to the restaurant. But BEWARE the servers are rude and could care less of the service they provide. There was many instances that a server would cut me off in the middle of the sentence. Overall coming to the R Lounge is definitely a great expelieren de with the exception of the workers and their attitude.' u'Great bar inside the Renaissance Hotel with a magnificent view of Times Square. Service was awesome. Our server Silvia recommended a few appetizers and we had a great time eating and enjoying the view.   Drinks were also fantastic and the prices were on point for NYC. Reservations are recommended but we went back a second time and walked right in.' u"Excellent view I'd go back just for a drink with a view. \n\nService was a bit slow and they got of our orders wrong even though the place was not full (Wednesday night). Food was just ok high prices must be just for the location and looks of the place." u"Okay we stayed in the hotel so they did a great job of getting us up on the window.  This is an AMAZING view of Times Square I don't think you get a better view.\n\nService was excellent they were very friendly during our late dinner. Breakfast service was very good as well.  They aren't open for lunch I don't believe.\n\nThe food was very nice pizza was thicker style and I had the tenderloin and it was solid.  Drinks were quick which is always good." u"Great place to meet with friends. Appetizers are great!!  Drinks flow!  Service is too notch. \nThe view is amazing!!!  I'd come back here for that alone. Seriously though the wait staff has always been very attentive.  The drinks are always perfectly mixed. The apps are the bomb. My fav is the grilled cheese and tomato bisque." u'We stumbled upon this awesome spot during our March visit to NYC. It was one of the highlights of the trip. The view of Times Square can\'t be beat. The food and service was amazing. We chatted with our server about spending NYE here and it sounds like we have a new "bucket list" item! The grilled cheese and tomato soup is a must-try! Can\'t wait to go back...hopefully on NYE!' u"First off it's a lounge.  That being said expect a limited food menu.  Okay now that that's out of the way this place is great!  It's located on the Lobby floor of the Renaissance overlooking Times Square.  We went there with the family to get something to eat and drink before we braved the crowds below.  \n\nMade a res for 7:30.  Got there a little bit early and asked if we could be seated.  No problem.  Host got us a table where we all had a good view of the lights marquees and people.  Ambience is nice and cozy.  Dim lights and some nice easy music.  We ordered drinks and unwound from the days activities.  The Manhattan was pretty tasty.  Nice pour.  I ordered the Lobster Roll. What arrived was not what I pictured a lobster roll to be.  It was some lobster meat between tow pieces of bread Panini style.  Tasted okay.  Don't think I'd order it again.  Wifey got the lamb.  That tasted really good and the cauliflower puree was delicious.  Other things ordered were some Buffalo Wings Brisket Sliders and Crispy Shrimp.  All of these were good. Not anything memorable but good food.  Let me remind you it's a lounge so the portions were a little small.  But the drinks were good and location location location.  \n\nThis place is great to hang out and have some drinks before venturing out to the madness below.  I'll be coming back every time I'm in town." u'The view alone is stunning but the food is great much better than I expected.  The drinks were excellent but VERY strong which was a plus for us but one should be wary.\n\nOur only complaint is that when we called about 30 minutes before we arrived the person on the phone told us reservations weren\'t necessary.  But when we arrived the place was full and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table to open in the dining room.  Apparently reservations ARE necessary but you have to make them through OpenTable.  I was not particularly upset however (these things happen) and had some champagne at the bar while we waited.  We ended up at a table for two right beside a window looking directly over Time Square.  Well worth the wait!\n\nThe champagne I had was excellent (it was the brut they had and I recommend it)  and the spicy wings we ordered were phenomenal.  We also ordered a flatbread which I highly enjoyed and the "grown-up" grilled cheese which was pretty good but was aided by the lovely tomato soup it came with.\n\nThe atmosphere is stunning; incredibly classy.  The bar is a bit cramped but quite elegant.  And the staff was very kind and attentive. The maitre d was very patient even seeing that we were clearly flustered about getting the wrong information over the phone and was incredibly accommodating and even came over to check on us during the meal.  I wish we had run into her on the way out I would have loved to have thanked her again.\n\nI\'m honestly surprised we were able to get a table here at all given the location and the time of year.  This place almost seems like a hidden gem we thought.  Absolutely make time to come here we will definitely be coming back the next time we\'re in town.' u"Crap. I had the worst experience of customer service I've ever had in a while. I came here from Detroit to visit NY for the first time and saw the 4 star rating on yelp. Wanted to take my mother out for a nice dinner. The view was spectacular the food 2/5 the service 1/5 and it really wasn't what I expected i don't recommend you come here unless you call ask for the menu and make sure you have a good waitress. Don't recommend unless you're coming for a drink and the view that's all. 2.5/5 total score I'd give it." u'Conveniently located in Times Square this lounge overlooks Times Square with all the bright lights in those billboards but without penetrating through specialized privacy heavily tinted glass walls. Thus it is one way looking out and folks from down outside can not invade private onlookers from inside! Clever! Always a nice stop for a cocktail or a beer and get relief from the hustle and bustle of the crowd that is on XSq!' u"Pros: \n- Skillet cookie was bomb dot com. I kid you not! It comes out and looks like just a normal cookie then you take a bite and your tastebuds are on cloud 9! Strongly recommend saving room for this dessert if you're coming here! (Although we didn't have room for dessert but finished it anyways- YOLO!) \n- Prime location. Amazing view of Times Square (if you get good seats!)\n- Ambiance allows for you to wear just about anything from casual to dressy. \n- Cozy lounge-like atmosphere. Well decorated!\n- Good service that's very attentive to your needs. \n- Great place to get a drink! (with a great view) \n\nCons: \n- Came here on a cold day and I was shivering the entire time. Wish the heat was up a little bit higher as it gets cold sitting next to the window! \n- Limited menu if you're coming here to eat. \n- Ordered the flatbread and it was cold and soggy. Taste-wise it was good but wish it was cooked a little more and brought out sooner. \n- Overpriced but I guess you're paying for the location/ambiance. \n\nWould I recommend it to a friend? Yes! Definitely a cute spot for a date or to lounge and have a few drinks! I'd give this more of a 3.5/5 stars but I'm bumping it up to 4 stars rather than down to 3 primarily because the view. My date made reservations and requested a window seat (which they accommodated to! kudos!) which I would recommend doing so you get a good seat with a view rather than stuck inside.\n\nP.S. Looking at the menu now on the restaurants website I see that they also have a Hot Chocolate Menu! Whaaaat? I wasn't given that menu but it seems like they only have it from November-February and judging by how delicious their dessert was I'd definitely come back to try their hot chocolate." u"This is located within the Renaissance Hotel in Times Square and the location is perfect (in the block over from M&Ms).\n\nWe walked in and the space is nice and cozy dimly lit w a blue undertone. The views are amazing. \n\nWe checked in and went straight to the room dropped off our stuff and came to have a drink here. It's got a great view of Time Square. It's a hotel bar so prices arent the best but they're tolerable. We had two beers and a bacardi and sprite. I will say that as good as the location was the service was kind of terrible. Took about 10 minutes to get waters and about that long to receive them. We were there for 45 minutes and had one drink each....not cuz we didnt want more but because the server NEVER CAME BACK! My mom wanted a glass for her beer cuz he dropped off bottles and she gave us because if she waited to have him come back the beer would have been cold. \n\nOn that note if a woman orders a beer at a nice lounge at least offer her a glass!\n\nA nice place to go if you're a guest of the hotel like we were but not somewhere I'd recommend to go on its own." u"I booked the place cause of its great view of Time Square and to people watch after a late broadway show.  The view was spectacular!!!  My expectations for the food was low due to usual bar food- but my wife and I were pleasantly surprise by the food.  The service was spectacular.  The view didn't disappoint.  I highly recommend you make reservations to get great seats with a view.  Will recommend to anyone." u'Awesome location in the middle of times square. The food was good though portions were small. The place is more suited for drinks than for meals un general. The service was so-so one waiter was very nice but others were almost rude.'],0.2609,0.136,0.864,0.0
14.Bea,[u"Ran in here for a bite after Sleep No More. What an awesome little spot. Food was very unique and really was satisfying. Drinks were delicious and full of the good stuff ;o)\nPlus they had some quality classic missive playing--coming to america !!! Here's a corny joke:\nSHE'S YOUR QUEEN TO BEA !!!!\n\nHa\n\nLove this place though great atmosphere to feel like a funky NYCer" u"Came here on a casual wednesday night before dave and busters. Their food is very good! I had the cheese plate that was made for 4 between me and a friend. It was a big cheese plate for just $24 dollars. The fruit on it was very fresh and YUMMY. \n\nThen I got the green pasta and my friend had the uncle tommy's pie. THE GREEN PASTA WAS SO GOOD. It has been a while since I had pasta so good - please beware that its not like authentic Italian good but rather its applebee's super fatty - lots of flavor and discussing for you good. \n\nWe also got a few cocktails which is cheap for new york standards ($12-14) but were nothing special." u'I was pretty excited to try this place to be honest but unfortunately I didn\'t get to. Why am I reviewing then you may ask? Well because I needed to rate the service I received of this place because the business owner should know. Guests beware the staff is incredibly rude here they are far from accommodating & the service is absolutely terrible. \n\nI went to this place and tried to get a table for an app and some drinks. There were lots of open tables but I was told that they were booked solid but that I could go to the bar. So I go to the bar and there were no seats or a place to stand. We decided to wait it out for about 10 mins and a standing room table opened. We took that table but never got any service. The manager came up to us and said he would look for some seats but never returned. In the meantime I found a seat stashed by the piano so I grabbed that to put under our table for our coats and such. Still never got any service at this point and another waitress comes up and tells me that she had to take my chair. I asked why and they said they needed to use it for extra seating would that be ok? I\'m like I don\'t really have a choice do I? So she proceeded to take the chair which made me super annoyed. Then our "should have been waiter" came up to us and said "I was under the impression that you guys were going to go to the bar but I guess I can be your waiter". You guess? That\'s your job. \n\nAt that point we had it and didn\'t want to give an establishment with these kind of incredibly rude employees our business. The best part is after walking out I pulled up the Yelp app and they have tables available for reservations being booked within 2 mins. Absolutely ridiculous.' u"Coming from DC my friends had high expectations for bottomless brunch at Bea and we were sadly disappointed. Apart from the French toast and the pork shoulder the food was good. I'm not a fan of fish but I would go back for the salmon. The French toast (if you can call it that) was half a brioche hamburger bun literally pulled out of the package and covered in strawberries and a banana slice. You could've at least warmed it up! The pork shoulder was just chewy and the combination of kidney beans and sour cream really missed the mark. \n\nWhat really bothered us was the terrible service we got. Brunch is for 2 hours reservation required. I expect the drinks to be free flowing and the food to keep congrats for the entire 2 hours. Our waiter let us just sit their for 40 min and nothing was brought out until we asked over and over again. On top of that he was just rude or would try to persuade us to order less." u"We went to BEA for bottomless brunch after church on a Sunday. We were quickly seated (I guess we were fortunate as the place is a busy joint). Our server was amazing and the ambience was very nice as well. Great menu options for the bottomless brunch. $45 per person. We had almost every item on the menu as they are shareable small plates. The mimosas were real nice. I had the carpe diem. Great drink. The pork shoulder smoked salmon spinach and egg pie Candied BACON!! eggs Benedict m pear salad...all great stuff. So if you're there at the bottomless brunch hour you're in luck cuz you will not be disappointed. I was in my happy place while I was there. Definitely coming back on my next trip to New York. \n(Pic- smoked salmon with honey. So good)" u"A great restaurant located in a location notorious for not having the best of eats!\n\nMy friend was celebrating a birthday at a club nearby and as a pregame birthday dinner she asked me to find a good spot. Bea exceeded everyone's expectations.\n\nThe restaurant is adorable and the food is very good. I had the ricotta appetizer and it was awesome. Tommy's pie (which is like a shepard's pie) was a crowd favorite and the sea bas was very fresh.\n\nThe cocktails weren't that good though. I didn't like mine (too strong) and a few people didn't like theirs either. Stick to beer and wine or normal libations like margaritas gin and tonics etc.\n\nOverall very pleased. Good to know there's a place like this in midtown!" u"Respects the definition of brunch. Not one of those pick a plate and add $25+ for bottomless overjuiced mimosas. Nope. This is the real deal endless* food and booze to keep that a smile plastered across your face and a satisfied if not too full feeling in your belly. We received a total of 17ish different plates and countless cocktails (mind you there were about 5 to choose from) and our tummies couldn't be happier. While the option to order more of any plate was there we were hesitant  knowing the amount of plates that were going to follow. Incredible deal... in fact total win for the diner. *2 hour time limit. \nWe will return... often. The staff is definitely here to make your stay memorable. Thank you Bea." u"I used to live right across the street from Bea but never went until years after I moved out of the neighborhood (so.freaking.loud). I always saw the cute BEA sign outside the restaurant when I was walking home. I've been twice now once for dinner and another time for drinks. \n\nI got the GREEN PASTA (creamy fresh spinach tagliatelle pasta with marinated shrimp) which was absolutely delicious. The sauce was not heavy at all (for a white sauce) and I really enjoyed the pasta. \n\nAn appetizer I loved was the HOUSE RICOTTA (with rosemary honey and sea salt). They give you a few pieces of baguette with it. I'm obsessed with ricotta so I might be biased but I loved the combo very much. We also tired the SPICY LAMB MEATBALLS (with smoked chipotle tomato sauce raita and pita bread). It was yummy but nothing memorable. \n\nDrinks: I've tried a few different ones. I think my favorite is ANYTHING GOES (Beach Plum Gin Pomegranate Syrup Lime Juice & Prosecco). Second fave is BROOKLYN CUE (Brooklyn Gin Elderflower Liqueur Cucumber Lemon Juice and a Sugar Rim). I think their cocktails are a bit on the sweeter side and not that strong. \n\nGreat place for a group dinner or to grab a few drinks with friends. It's a little loud in there and the bar is usually packed. There's seating around the bar but you'll be lucky to get a seat the second you get there." u'3.5 stars but rounded up.\n\nRESERVATION: Made a reservation via phone about 2 weeks in advance and didn\'t have any trouble for a group of 6 on a Saturday night.  Our reservation placed us in the outside area (which is the nicest spot).\n\nATMOSPHERE: There are 2 sections to the restaurant.  The outside is a courtyard (closed) area with a movie playing string lights trees and a greenhouse type roof that lets natural light in.  I would say this is the ideal place because it has a great open atmosphere.  The inside is more dark and also has movies playing with the bar in the middle.  Also more of a romantic/date like atmosphere because of the dark lighting.  Overall a good place to eat after a show or with a date or even a birthday or group outing.  It has a little bit of a "rustic" or old feel but still trendy.  Kind of like Foreign Cinema in SF.\n\nFOOD: Lots of options for $15-20 and the food portions while not HUGE are enough for 1 person to feel satisfied. \n\nDUCK TURNOVER - enough for 1 person even though it\'s on the appetizer side.  Almost like a huge empanada it has a puff pastry like outer shell that is flaky and crusty.  It also has other Mexican like toppings.  My friends said it was pretty good.\n\nMAC N CHEESE - a good thing to share with everyone for a group of 5 (one person didn\'t come) we each got 2-3 spoonfuls.  It doesn\'t seem to have bacon but it has a bacon taste in it somehow...the pasta was a little overcooked but the cheese wasn\'t overpowering or too cheesy and I liked that the top was breaded and baked so it was drier.\n\nENGLISH MUFFIN BURGER - the most bang for your buck in my opinion since it\'s a huge burger and fries.  The fries are rustically cut with skin still on them and pretty good.  The burger is thick the patty is like the size of a filet mignon.  I asked for medium rare and it was more medium.  The flavor of the patty itself was a little forgettable but the cheese is shredded and then slightly melted which was interesting.  The cheese was flavorful and added a good "punch."  The English muffin was also interesting it was thin but crispy.  How an English muffin normally tastes toasted and it actually made a good hamburger bun!\n\nOverall decent/good food not amazing but good for what it is and a good atmosphere.' u'I went to NYC to see a show and spend the day with some friends.  Someone suggested this place and I was game.  So we went there for brunch and it was $45 for 2 hours of unlimited small plates and "brunch" cocktails!!  The food here was great the tuna tar tar was really good as well as the smoked salmon and pork shoulder!  \n\nAnd did I mention the bottomless drinks??  I mean our primary goal was to drink $45 in alcohol and take small bites of food in between.  Our goal was met... it was met so much that when I was watching "Book of Mormon" I had to cover one eye because I was seeing double. LOL. \n\nAnyways we got to Bea a little before they opened on a Saturday so our wait for 4-5 of us was minimal and the service was great.  We used our 2 hour time and I feel we achieved our goal.  The food and drinks were great and I would definitely go back to here the next time I visit NYC.' u'Got to BEA at 6 to eat before an 8 curtain with no reservation. They seated us quickly in the back room- which is lovely with skylight and pop culture decor. I enjoyed the food - had the scallops and asparagus the latter which was cooked to perfection. For desert I ordered poached pear with fig ice cream but they were out of he pear so I got the lemon pie with the ice cream. Loved both. Service was good. The dishes took a bit long to reach the table but really had no issues with that because I was catching up with my friend.' u"My\nHusband and I stumbled upon this place when looking for a brunch spot. It was unlimited food and mimosas for $45 each but unfortunately the bartender told us this will be the last weekend that they offer the bottomless brunch.  She said they might offer it at the bar only but they haven't decided yet. Cute atmosphere with a little outdoor terrace and a live jazz band. It's best to get a reservation or you'll most likely end up at he bar(Which is fine too!).\n\nBack to the food. Yummy! All of the food was really fresh and good.  A few reviews complained about the portion sizes but we did not experience small portions. AT ALL! Most of the dishes were almost full sized portions.  We ordered the thick cut bacon and they brought out the entire pig. The French toast and smoked salmon were sooo good. I don't have just one favorite thing.  I would definitely come back here!" u"I'm guessing that my taste buds are different than most of the people reviewing. I tried the Tuna guac and the Duck turnover. The duck turnover came highly recommended from the waiter and I'm sorry but it tasted horrible. Or was to many things going on-pineapplesThai chili sauce avocado sauce- ugh no. I hate to say but that was by far one of the worst bits of food that I've tasted in a long long time. The tuna guac had a strong onion taste and was super salty. Maby I came on a bad night but the two items I ordered were not good. The decor and ambience were both nice. I live in L.A. and it reminded me (decor wise) of a mini version of the Edison." u'Finally got to try this place out after being bookmarked for a while. Came here with a group of 12 total for a birthday gathering. My friend reserved ahead of time and was able to accomdate us. The walk in into this resturant is dimmed light with music and people talking. It felt nice and cozy in which how a Saturday night should be. We got sat down quickly in a decent size curtained room for our group. All round individual tables(meant for 2)  inside which was inconvenience to sit together so we had to split 6 and 6 on one side and the other side leaving the center for waiters to walk in and out. There was definitly a Lost of socialization since it was good distance apart where as a group is usually together as a whole.\nJust keep in mind they charge  $25 for cutting cake which was never ever mentioned till last second we were asked to bring the cake out which was a minus.\nThe staff were nice and easy going. They made sure we got our orders in and food & water in our table. My husband and I together  we ordered a glass of rose a glass of red wine lamb meatball appetizer sea bass and the chicken & bell pepper. We both agreed that the drinks and foods were delicious and meet our expectations. \nAlso keep in mind usually if you have X many guess they automatically charge your gratitude on the bill .  We were charged 20% for our group. Overall amongst 12 people totalling splitting the bill of  $669 among 11 people was not too bad(minus bday girl). That $25 for cutting the cake was no bueno.' u"This is my new favorite place to eat and drink in Hell's Kitchen. \n\nI like West Bank food a lot (truffled orzo mac and cheese side for 12 is big and filling and wonderful; their chicken dish may be my favorite chicken in Manhattan). \n\nBut the ambiance upstairs is sorta well it's fine but it's not really cooll. \n\nBea is COOL. White brick walls and projections of black and white movies); fantastic music (a range but always fun mix of jazz rock and R and B); terrific fun friendly servers and hosts. \n\nThere are some snacks (ricotta with toast is 8 and a fine appetizer) plus full menu. Flatbreads are good. \n\nThe cocktails (specialty) are all 13. That's low for infused spirits and fairly complex concoctions. \n\nI love this place of whose existence I had no knowledge till a friend told me to meet him and his college classmate for a drink after a show at Birdland. \n\nIt's kind of a no man's land for food and the bars are not well it's Hell's Kitchen. Let's just leave it at that." u"Wow. First of all I'm so happy they take reservations given how busy this place seemed. We were a party of 4-5 on a Wednesday evening and we didn't have any trouble booking a few days in advance. We picked Bea partially because their vegetarian options are plentiful and as 3/4 of us were veggies this place made sense. \n\nI gave lack of one star because had I been hungrier I would've ordered more food. My review for the food of this place is restricted to their tomato-based soup which was delicious but pretty average. We also ordered the house ricotta for the table to start - the dash of sea salt on there is incredible mixed with the honey! I'm intrigued to try the stuffed tomato dish. I'd love to come back here on a less busy day or perhaps for brunch.\n\nNot to mention the decor is just absolutely adorable. Very cute & unique; this would be a great place for a date." u"As an Oregonian I am always on the lookout and constantly craving good brunch so I was very excited to discover a bottomless brunch place right near my apartment. I have been to Bea a couple of times for their bottomless brunch and both times have been very satisfying. \n\nService at the restaurant for the speed of getting your food definitely depends on your server and how you order. The first time we went for bottomless brunch there they gave us our food very slowly and lost a bunch of orders. However the second time we went we learned our lesson and ordered a bunch of plates up front and they were able to bring out the food at a steady pace. Additionally our server was fabulous and kept our alcohol flowing. As soon as our glass was empty she would be back with another mimosa. \n\nThe food itself had great presentation for every dish. Taste wise was ok to great depending on the dish. I loved the tuna tar guac as well as salmon. Everything else is kind of standard for other brunch places and flavor wise is just ok. The pork shoulder had good flavor but was really dry. Also don't get the bacon it was just too much sauce on very dry meat not good at all. \n\nThere is a time limit of two hours so definitely keep an eye on that. We accidentally got an extra drink a couple minutes after our time and were charged extra for them. \n\nBea is also just a really adorable restaurant with great ambience. For brunch they always have a jazz band playing so it's just lots of fun to come out and eat brunch with friends!" u"I loved this place the first time I went decided to go back after a couple of days . Once me and my friend got there they had to only serve certain foods due to the health inspector showing up. Since I had a great experience the first time decided to go back . The food must I say was terrible my drink tasted terrible  server was not friendly what so ever my steak smelled weird and fries were soggy . \nLesson learned the health inspector showing up should've been a sign no to go back .\nDon't waste your money people." u'Made a reservation through Yelp and were seated right away!\n\nAmbiance: cool vibe and great crowd. A bit loud but we were seated in a corner in the room with the tree. There was a cool black and white movie being projected onto the wall. \n\nFood: ordered the shrimp toast which my boyf really liked and tuna tar guac which I thought tasted better haha. I was a bit thrown off since the pictures on Yelp showed toast but it was actually served in flatbread. Meh. Tuna tar guac id recommend though!\n\nDrinks: We ordered the South Pacific which Japanese whiskey and Brooklyn Cue with had the gin cucumber and sugar rim - YUM!' u'I enjoyed the warm atmosphere and the menu had a eclectic variety. Solid food all around.'],0.1531,0.348,0.652,0.0
88.Blue Maiz,[u"I was in the area and in the mood for Mexican and this place was close and had good reviews.\nIt's set up kind of like Chipotle as far as picking out what you want. This store is actually set up long way where the line starts from the front and the counter is to your right. \nThe food was delicious and definitely a return trip if I am in the area again. \nThe seating was a lot of two tops and some counter seating too. The place was busy during lunch." u"The first time I went here I just thought Blue Maiz would generically fill the burrito size hole in my heart after I swore off Chipotle.\n\nHowever they really excelled in the challenge. Yes it is the same format as the rest of the burrito places but they just taste better. There is definitely a quality jump up from the chains. I work across the street from here and this has become my go to quick lunch. Sometimes the lines can get rather long but they go fast. If you don't go during peak times you should be able to get in and out super quick." u"I was in NEW YORK CITY and stumbled upon this place. It was around lunch time and there was a line out the door. I quickly turned to YELP and read some of the reviews and said what the heck imma give it a whirl. And let me tell you I am sure glad I did!\n\nAlthough the line was out the door the service was pretty fast. The concept puts you in the mind of chipotle which ironically was right across the street with no line. I choose rice chicken beans and veggies which was all topped off with salsa and sour cream. I also grabbed some street corn. I don't know what they did to their food but the chicken was well seasoned and that street corn.....oh my it was so good!!\n\nThis place is legit! Not too far from Times Square it is a nice hole in the wall. Prices are reasonable and the servers are friendly. My ONLY gripe is I wish they offered self serve fountain drinks. You have to pay a $1 for a refill. However it was no big deal. \n\nI'm not going to tell you that I went for a 2nd visit before leaving.........." u'Great option right across the street from Chipotle with a similar menu style. I got the vegetarian (onions and peppers guac corn salad as the meat) salad and was happy with the quality of the ingredients. The star of the show for me was the guac and salsa verde. The salsa verde had a nice kick to it but was very flavorful and acted as a great dressing for the salad. I will easily be back in the future to try more!' u"My coworkers told me about this place and raved that it was the best Mexican restaurant around our office so naturally I was curious. Everyone kept saying it was better than chipotle and I love chipotle. The first thing that caught my eye was the blue corn tortillas. It was delicious. I've tried the carne asada and it was extremely flavorful. I haven't tried the other meat options since the carne asada looked too delicious to avoid. \nThe onions are cut a little bit bigger than I would have liked. I really like the selection of sauces at the end where they categorize it by hotness. Overall not bad but the guy that served me didn't give me too much so that made me a little sad." u'With all the hype around chipotle when blue maiz opened up around the corner from job I immediately wanted to try them out. My office ordered and I got the Naked burrito with steak lettuce salsa verde corn salad cheese & sour cream. DELICIOUS! I had never had salad verde before and I love the pineapples in it . I frequent this place a lot instead of chipotle \u200d' u"Good price and good food. Great lunch spot. \n\nCame for lunch with my bf around 1245pm on a weekday. Place had an extremely long line but it went by pretty quickly. Most of the people ordered to go so there was ample seating at the fairly large restaurant. \n\nI ordered a burrito with Carne asada salsa verde and numerous add-ons. My burrito was over packed so they weren't really able to wrap it right. I had so much trouble eating as stuff kept falling out of my tortilla but it still taste good. I probably should have ordered a naked burrito instead cuz I eventually just started to use a fork to eat the contents inside. Food was fresh and verrrry filling.\n\nBf ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla. It was delicious. Cheesy a good amount of meat inside. I really loved the flavors. They give you some warm tortilla chips a small sauce container of Pico DE gallo and sour cream on the side. \nThis was a decently priced lunch at less that $9/person." u"This place I really like and enjoy. It is in a cool area in walking distance to American Beauty this one cool club that I didn't get in.\n\nThe food is really good." u"Better than Chipotle: better ingredients better variety of meats bigger portions and tasty sides. \n\nI just got a bowl with pork and everything else and thoroughly enjoyed. The brown rice is good not the usual cheap crap you get in other places. \n\nFriendly and professional service. Very affordable compared to what you get. \n\nYes I'm fan. :-)" u"THIS PLACE IS BOMB DOT COME GET ME. \n\nWe ordered two naked burritos (one chicken menuzada and one grilled chicken) as well as 3 grilled chicken tacos w/ their homemade and handmade corn tortillas. Holy moly were they packed deliciously to the brim! The chicken menuzada was heavenly - the shredded chicken was well marinaded in their homemade red sauce which was extremely flavorful (quite sweet) without being overwhelming. They don't skimp on their fresh ingredients! They also only use products that are natural and sodium free with veggies from local seasonal markets. \nThe corn tortillas were chewy and weren't ripping within seconds of picking it up like some other competitor spots. \n\nIt took over an hour to deliver so that could be worked on considering it can't take too long to make these foods. It looks like it runs on a Chipotle concept but this spot beats it by a mile. \n\nThe guajillo is their hottest salsa - it's a thick gooey hot mess - in a good way. It's spicy enough for my liking (could be deadly when consumed in spoonfuls). The salsa roja was meh as it didn't have much going for the texture or taste - should've gone for the chipotle crema." u'This place is like a healthier alternative to chipotle (taste wise in my opinion). I stopped by here for lunch. It is spacious and have a good amount of seating. They offer burrito nachos tacos quesadilla naked burrito and salad. They have grilled chicken pork beef and vegetarian as meat options. They have 4 types is salsa. I asked the staff what the differences in salsa are but he did not respond to me. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian burrito with lettuce corn salad cheese white rice and salsa roja. The burrito was pretty decent. I like their guacamole. The size of the burrito is like the size of a chipotle burrito. Good for 1 person. I\'ll probably come back and try their quesadilla. I don\'t fine many places that has "make your own" quesadillas. The soft tacos looked pretty small so I wouldn\'t order it if you\'re hungry.' u"The food is not better than chipotle. I just wanted something different and it's almost exactly the same except they charge for extra salsa sour cream and refills on soda. Game over. \nGo to chipotle across the street." u"This place is exactly like chipotle so I don't get the hype. I do like the large portion because I can leave my uneaten half of it in the work fridge and eat it for tomorrow's lunch. It's a 2-for-1 meal!\nThe guajillo hot sauce is actually hot by the way." u"Came here on a school break with my friend. It was new and up and coming as a Chipotle competitor and since I love Chipotle but get sick of it because I eat it so much I had to come try it. They have naked bowls (burrito bowls) burritos and tacos your standard build-your-own Mexican establishment. I got a naked bowl with shredded chicken (I forget the name but it was marinated in a light orange sauce). I liked that they offered many types of more authentically Mexican types of marinated meats and the cob-off elote corn was a nice touch as well. It was pretty cheap (I think $1 less than a bowl at Chipotle?) but the line was SO long. Would visit again when the hype dies down. Don't know how I feel about the orange Spanish rice (not too flavorful) but everything is worth a try here!" u'Yes it reminds me of a certain chain...\n\nWhile I never like comparing it has been mentioned in other reviews that it is very similar in style. \n\nStopped in earlier for a quick lunch with the Mrs.  She ordered the chicken tortilla soup and street corn.  I in turn went with the three tacos.  One each chickenchorizo and beef.  For the beef I opted to try the blue corn tortilla and regular corn for the rest.  \n\nSeems like this place just opened because they still have the grand opening sign out front and balloons inside.  My tacos were smallish in size but extremely flavorful.  Of the three I would have to say the chorizo was my favorite just enough heat. I had their mild salsa roja but may have to come back to try the others.  \n\nBlue Maiz is very reasonably priced especially for being in midtown Manhattan. This should be on a list of places to check out when in the city.  \n\nEnjoy.' u"I had 30 minutes to get something to eat while waiting for my bus at port authority. Found this great place on Yelp!  It's similar to Chipotle but better in every aspect. Coincidentally it's right across from a Chipotle that appears to have closed down. I had the salad bowl with chicken. The grilled corn topping is what really made it for me." u"This is a great stop for lunch or dinner for a chipotle supplement. The flavors here are much better and you get a little bit more food here as well.\n\nThis place is a typical pick what you want inside a bowl burrito tacos or nachos. The steak is where it's at. It has a nice charred flavor while not being chewy. \n\nI ordered the nachos and they were delicious.\nThey load up the meat on these I was quite surprised.\n\nI highly recommend their creamy chipotle sauce. It is oh so so good.\n\nThere service is also very good. My friend and I were splitting a bowl as well and the gladly only put certain things we wanted on our half of the bowl. \n\nThe decor is very modern and clean. I will be back to try the roasted corn because it looked amazing." u"Soooo good I love Blue Maiz more than Chipotle. Its portion is really big thats what i like lol ummm here's guak is not that good though Chips are quite thick \nI prefer Chipotle's chips and guak" u"Good pricing good service good options - but I didn't love the nacho chips. Must be the blue corn thing just isn't for me. Also the meat was a little chewy/fatty in parts that didn't sit well with me." u"VERY VERY friendly service. HUGE portions at great prices. Super authentic. Probably better than any chain I've had.\n\nCheck in on Yelp for 10% off!"],0.4926,0.21,0.79,0.0
206.MakiMaki,[u"I decided to stop by MakiMaki since I was in the area and found this place quite interesting. I came in with my friend who ordered a spicy salmon hand roll. I wasn't hungry but took a bite and was amazed by how fresh the quality was! I ordered one of their green tea drinks and found it very refreshing. \n\nI came here a second time a week or two later and ordered a few rolls and a couple hand rolls as well. It was so good that I decided to order another hand roll even though I was super full! \n\nI recommend anyone that's in the area to try out this place it'll be my go to sushi place from now on. Everything tastes so fresh and everyone here was super friendly as well!" u"Fresh sushi and great sushi but portions are so small. Ordered one hand roll and one sushi roll and came to $14 and change which I'm okay with. Sushi rolls seemed smaller than normal and I was done with my meal in less than 5 minutes. No lunch special which is disappointing. Overall sushi was fresh but I can't get over the price point for the amount of food you get. \n\nWould I return? No" u"I work in Midtown West and am at a regular at several area sushi spots since it's an easy and quick lunch. Avoid MakiMaki. Here's why.\nWent here for the first time today and had 14 minutes to eat before a meeting. Place has three bar stools and a seatless standing table that's about 6 inches wide. The restaurant is in a very narrow space.\n\nI ordered my two rolls and cold green tea -$22- no lunch specials here. Very pricy for a takeout joint. \nAnyway there is no place to sit  and I quickly eat my two rolls at the standing table. I'm alone and clearly eating quickly.\n\nAlex the cashier yells out my name (he knew it from my order) and demands that I move out of the way from the foot traffic. There is no foot traffic. People are staring. I explain that  I'm down to three more pieces of food I will be gone in a minute. He insists that I move. Unneeded drama for midtown west. Place is overpriced and unfriendly." u"Delicious premium sushi to-go. The shop is immaculately clean everything is customizable the fish is fresh and the rice is a perfectly sticky and chewy combination. The staff recommended 2-3 rolls depending on how hungry you are. I got the Bluefin Toro Handroll and Spicy Salmon Roll and ate everything down to the last grain of rice. Let's not pretend that MakiMaki is the most economical option for lunch around but in terms of quality and portions you definitely get a bang for your buck." u'Awesome new sushi fast casual. Quick service and very innovative maki rolls.\nGreat value rolls are 7-8$' u"I've wanted to try MakiMaki for a while and wanted to do so today! Everything inside was so nice and clean. I ordered a shrimp tempura hand roll and a spicy crab hand roll which were both delicious. They have the plastic wrap around the seaweed to keep it nice and crispy. You can see that they clean up very well after making each roll and everyone was really friendly! My friend and I walked to Central Park to eat which was right there since there were no seats inside the restaurant." u'Not going to lie the hand roll looked a little daunting to me. But I had to try it since they dubbed it their specialty and I am glad that I did! The fish is so fresh and tasty! I highly recommend if you are looking for a quick grab and go sushi place.' u"The hand rolls are made to order. It's an impressive assembly line as they meticulously package the food and provide all the condiments so efficiently to the customer on time. However the 3 hand rolls didn't impress. I wish the rice was seasoned better. It didn't taste like anything special. I could not differentiate the rolls from the tuna belly to the hamachi very much. The salmon avocado was fresh though." u"Just got lunch here. Their rolls are fresh and made right. It doesn't have an obscene amount of rice like most quick sushi roll places and the quality is great. I'll definitely be coming back for lunch on the regular. I like how the rolls are made fresh and not sitting around which makes the rice hard. The staff is friendly and the place is clean." u'This place gets down on sushi!!! I got the spicy crab and California roll and they were mmm mmmm mmmm!!! Definitely recommend to sushi lovers and the price is very reasonable.' u'The spicy tuna and spicy salmon hand roll is amazing. They definitely provide you a huge amount of seafood inside the handroll. Love the clean packaging of the food as well as the interior!' u"Not impressed. Nothing really special aside from rolls made in the moment. My spicy tuna roll was pasty and sticky and not particularly tasty. My son's salmon and avocado roll was fresh so he won't let me give it two stars. \n\nStaff was a little clueless." u"I am impressed. \nFor the price range I was expecting sushi that I could get from buffet lunch or grocery store but these hand rolls and sushi are worthy of restaurants quality and not just the average restaurants the very good ones. \nWhat impressed me the most are freshness of their rice and quality of their seafood. Maki Maki's rice is so well made with the perfect blend of sticky chewiness and subtle fragrance of rice. The bluefin fatty tuna was my favorite among hand rolls with the crab and avocado comes second. Fatty tuna's tender and juicy texture dissolves itself once chewed. Yuzu lemonade is also quite tasty. \nMaki Maki's staff were attentive patient and friendly. Their place is kept clean. And their food gets made very fast. I forgot to take my yuzu lemonade at first they remembered me and made me a new one for free when I went back to get it.\nThe only complaint I could possibly have is that there's absolutely no seats in this place. But that doesn't matter their sushi is so good that I'd eat them on the street if I have to." u"Clever new business with affordable but tasty hand rolls. My wife and I have eaten their hand rolls three times now and every time they've ranged from good to great. I can only imagine what the lunch rush is like now given the business in the area.\n\nWhen they fill the hand rolls the portion is generous and you don't feel like you've been shortchanged. The hand rolls use nori pre-wrapped in a removable seal which is really great if you need to take it back to the office. The first time I had their hand rolls was when my wife brought home two hand rolls--a spicy salmon and a yellowtail scallion--that survived a 45-minute subway ride thanks to those wrappers. (If you've ever had pre-wrapped onigiri like from Kinokuniya near Bryant Park you'll be familiar with the concept.)\n\nNote: They now have official closing hours; on the weekdays they are open until 8PM. If you passed by here when they were in their first week or so of business there may have been uncertainty around the hours. The first time I showed up which July 6th they hadn't established hours yet because they were trying to gauge traffic. That can be frustrating but it also makes a certain amount of sense; they're not a sit-down establishment and having a soft launch probably helped them better determine demand. In any case I still made it in time (a hair before 7PM) and was able to place an order." u"It's decent. Decent quality and fish quantity pretty good flavors especially enjoyed the Hamachi and scallion and the Spicy Scallop Roll.  Sushi is my go to will eat anytime snack and this place doesn't sacrifice quality for quick turnaround.  It's not a restaurant but it's better than fast food. I liked the yuzu lemonade.  Staff was friendly but the guy taking orders needs some more training/sushi knowledge." u"This place just opened up near my office and is a great place for a quick sushi lunch break. The service is fast enough that you can be in and out in 5 minutes and the rolls are fresh. I personally love the truffled eel sauce and get it on everything. The prices are also reasonable - I can easily get a light lunch here for under $10.\n\nDo keep in mind that there's not really anywhere to sit inside so you'll have to find outdoor seating or bring your food back to the office.\n\nThe staff are super friendly - I once realized I forgot my credit card at the cash register and had to leave to go get it but they were polite the entire time remembered my name and let me place a new order when I came back an hour later no questions asked." u'Amazing Food Great Staff very knowledgable about their products and super friendly. I definitely recommend this location to everyone who want fresh and tasty sushi.' u"If you are looking for a higher quality fast Japanese place this is a good option. I had the ikura hand roll which I wasn't that impressed with and also the spicy crab which was actually pretty good. I would skip the sauces as you have to pay for them which is kind of ridiculous and they are nothing special." u'I love that you can customize you rolls to your tastes here. Food drinks and service were all great.' u'Service here was really friendly and and pretty quick (considering there were only 2 others before me)\nThey did not give me exactly what was the best selling rolls - instead they told me it was all good!! which was pretty funny.\n\nAlso on line it says the sauce is complementary but that is no longer the case they charge 50cents per sauce.\n\nIn addition I got 4 rolls and paid $33+ which I fell was a little much for the size.\n\nEverything was fresh though and tasted pretty good!  \nNot sure if I would return due to the higher price.'],0.3182,0.204,0.796,0.0
60.Non Solo Piada,[u"The moment I walked in I knew this place would be great. I ended up getting the Toscana Piadizza and a few nutella bombolone (Italian Doughnuts). Everything was fantastic - one of the best lunches I've had in a very long time. The moment I bit into the bombolone I thought I was back in Italy. \n\nAlso the service was great. Will be coming back for more!" u"Great find very close to the madness of Penn Station. Highly recommended for a quick sandwich on the go whether you're jumping on the train or a bus. There are three small stools along the wall if you decide to eat inside. Go for the Cassoni - a delightful cheesy pocket sandwich with a wide array of meat options.\n\nThe menu is split between Piadine (open sandwich) Cassoni (pocket sandwich) and Piadizze (small pizzas). We tried the Siciliano Cassoni and the Diavola Piadine. Both were very good though I enjoyed the cheesy pocket of the cassoni more given the greasiness of Diavola. The Siciliano was a combination of eggplant ham and cheese melted together and enclosed in a flaky crust to make a perfect sandwich. Add in a fresh Illy espresso and you have a wonderful pick-me-up for your Amtrak ride." u'I love you Non Solo Piada! What a satisfying lunch. Delicious Italian street food. Perfect flatbreads. Everyone working there is informative and pleasant. They made so much out of their tiny space; nice decor and charging outlets.\n\nI only tried 2/3 of their menu offerings and they were both amazing. I had the quattro formaggi cassoni (sealed flatbread) & eggplant parmigiana piadine (open flatbread). So excited to try their piadizze and their dessert offerings.\n\nJust an Italian gem in New York . Please check it out for a quick bite. Auguroni!' u"I think I've finally found my go to lunch spot! The menu is very simple just a few varieties of Italian street fare. I highly recommend any of the Cassonis. If you haven't had a Cassoni it's a folded sandwich with cheese meat and vegetables inside. Think calzone but lighter bread and cheese. They're piping hot and the perfect portion size for lunch. The place is very tiny but the staff are very friendly. It's not necessarily the fastest but it's absolutely worth every second of waiting." u"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner after one of his coworkers brought a Cassone into the office for lunch. We were surprised by how small it was! there's virtually no seating space so be prepared to either eat your food elsewhere. That being said the inside of the place is very cute!\n\nOur cashier was amazingly friendly. She found out that it was our first time eating here and quickly explained the different types of foods they prepare. I ended up ordering the Piemontese Cassone and my boyfriend got the Newyorkese Piada. They came out pretty quickly and they were piping hot! I actually had to wait about 10 minutes until mine was cool enough but I'm kind of wimpy when it comes to temperature.\n\nThe Newyorkese Piada was really yummy! All the ingredients tasted really fresh and the consistency of the bread was nice.\n\nNow I take my truffles seriously and the Piemontese Cassone really knocked my socks off. When I opened the lid of the takeout container the hypnotic aroma of truffle oil washed over me and I knew that I was really going to enjoy this. I fought through my fear of burning my tongue so I could devour this cassone which is a testament to how good it smelled. It was totally worth it. You really can't go wrong with truffle oil mozzarella and sausage. There are so many other interesting things on the menu but I'm so in love with this cassone that I wouldn't mind only getting this when I come back to Non Solo Piada.\n\nOne thing to note is that the portions aren't big! I don't eat more than the average person does at a meal and I definitely wasn't satisfied after eating one of these guys for dinner. One thing is probably perfect for breakfast or lunch but I would probably get two things for dinner." u"Extremely cheap for what you get and exceptionally delicious! I got the Maialina which was a thin crust pizza with thinly sliced salami onions and basil atop tomato sauce and cheese. They make them to order (none of that reheating funny business) so you get your food piping hot and fresh. As a result of this the cheese was delectably stringy. I do wish there were a bit more onions on the pizza but that's only because they were delicious. Either way the portion you get more than justifies the cost--I think the most expensive menu item was $10. \n\nWill definitely be back to try the other flavor combinations!" u'Flatbreadapalooza.... This place makes everything on a type of flat bread\n\n  After staring at the menu I ordered the Margherita which is Roman plum tomatoes  mozzarella  pomodoro sauce  and basil in "pizza" form. So when you are a lover of New York and New Haven style pizzas and you order what looks like it should be a pizza then getting served "pizza" on a flatbread is a little disappointing. Had this been explained before I placed the order  I probably would have gotten a different flavor.  The woman tells us what it is well after the order is placed and she heard my friend saying that she didn\'t want to eat anything from there since she didn\'t know what any of it  was.  \nThe flatbread was made to order  and it had a nice fresh flavor. It\'s something that I would get again if I were on a diet and didn\'t want the guilt of eating regular pizza. \n\n  The Americano was like a flat bread sandwich.  It had grilled chicken mozzarella and roasted peppers.  All I could taste was the cheese. The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said "i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?" So I deconstructed a piece of the second half.  There was a small amount of chicken  but it looked shredded  just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn\'t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich. \n\nThis place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner. I wasn\'t overly full and it was a pleasant change from all of the heavy quick prepared foods in NY and It\'s definitely provides  a "lighter than pizza" pizza option' u"Delicious. They have home made bread that is served as a kind of sandwich or a filled pocket or a pizza. We got the mushroom pizza and the tomato mozzarella pocket. These were delicious and freshly made. The pizza especially had a beautiful crust and was perfectly baked. The filled pocket had tasty mozzarella and basil to keep the taste fresh and didn't let the cheese overwhelm you. \n\nAnd its cheap! All of that for $15. The staff was also very friendly. We will definitely be back for more more! And oooo those desserts looked good!" u"Neighborhood small Italian place in midtown serving Northern Italian street food. Everything is made fresh as you order. They specialize in piadina Italian flat bread they serve it 3 ways pizza style calzone style or classic. Very simple yet very tasty and delicious. Prices are very reasonable as well. Each item on the menu is very filling. \n\nI like how the crust of the pizzas don't get soggy right away. Enjoyed the Maialina since I love salami. The Toscana with prosciutto and arugula my favorite combo ever. The Diavolo with spicy salami & red peppers was delish! Don't forget the Nutella bombolone to complete the meal! Fun informal vibe of the restaurant is very appealing. If you want a quick and good service topping of your amazing food then pass by Non Solo Piada! Five stars!" u"I fell in love with piadine in Barcelona years ago and always wondered why we didn't have them in the States (in L.A. really at all) as much. Was happy to find this spot close to my hotel. I made my own: spicy salami red peppers and buffalo mozzarella. The spot is very small but there were a few chairs in there so I was able to eat there shielded from the rain. You can tell they're using quality ingredients but the piadina was much too thick and heavy: it should be thinner and a bit more crackery. It's a shame but I can't say I wasn't happy about having a piadina in the good ole USA it was nice to have after all these years." u"This is probably my new favorite little find. This tiny authentic Italian spot offers up big meals. It was a little early for lunch and I don't like croissants so I opted For the traviata piadina and added scrambled eggs to make it more breakfasty. It was delicious! I wouldn't hesitate adding eggs to any of their piadinas. For dessert I had one of their giant bombolones with Nutella. The only problem with the bombolone is that it's a little big after the meal. \nThe place was small quick and clean. I will be back!" u'Cassoni for breakfast? Yes please! We ordered the Piemontese the Calabrese and the Classico. All delicious and all recommended by my family.  \n\nIt is definitely a "to go" place since there are only 3 seats at a counter to sit at. We were lucky to score them for ourselves.' u"During my lunch break from work I walked over and ordered the Mantovana Cassone. The staff was super polite and smiling very welcoming Italian as well! Once my order was done and I walked back to work in the elevator a lot of people asked me what that delicious smell was from my food! I couldn't wait to sit down and eat it myself.\nThe first bite I had was warm half crispy and so SO good. The second bite I dipped in hot sauce with some ketchup and that really brought out the flavor.\nI can't wait to go back and try their other foods and I am definitely recommending this place to people from now on." u'Ordered the NewYorkese Piadine (roasted chicken grilled pancetta caramelized onions romaine tomato).  It was exactly as good as it sounded!  Solid 4.5 stars...bumping up because the staff was so nice and helpful.  Service was great.' u'Great food quick service amazing people\n\nNice little hole in wall midtown establishment always a great choice if your looking for lunch in Midtown' u"We stopped on yesterday because of the great reviews and this place was just as described. VERY friendly service and quick food. The toppings were delicious the crust could use some reworking but it's easy to overlook that because the overall experience was great." u'Amazing food with very non-NYC prices! Stopped by for breakfast and will definitely be back.  The owner seems like a wonderful lady with great customer service.' u"Wow! This is a great addition to the neighborhood. They serve delicious Piada or Piadina (an authentic thin Italian flatbread) specialty sandwiches pastries and even breakfast. This place has a very European feel and vibe....and smell :)\n\nThe storefront says 'Italian Street Food and Breakfast'...they had me at 'street food'. I ordered one of the breakfast pastries and a Piada with salami onions and fresh basil. It was one of the best pizzas I've had in quite a while. You can tell everything is made to order with fresh ingredients and love.\n\nThe seating area is very small so expect take out.\n\nI can't wait to go back for the mushroom Piada." u'Ordered the napoletano and the emiliano and they were both delicious! It definitely deserves a 5 star rating!' u'Amazing spot tucked away on a quiet street. This was a much needed respite from all of the craziness at Times Square and the theater district. We discovered this spot on our last day in the city for breakfast and my only regret was not trying this earlier. If you are staying anywhere near this place - stop here!!!!\n\nFor breakfast we ordered two coffees a croissant croissant sandwich and yogurt parfait. We also tried a Nutella donut that was delicious!!\n\nFor the price this was also one of the best deals in Manhattan.'],0.6696,0.272,0.728,0.0
193.Réunion,[u'Wow... let me say tacos tacos and tacos. Came here with a friend after a workout... after she was talking about yummy fish tacos in the area I had an instant craving so we made out say down to R\xe9union.\n\nShe recommended the fish tacos and the loaded tater tots. Man oh man... it was delicious. Sooo yummy and flavorful. Each bite of those fish tacos was so blissfully satisfying. The loaded taters were good. Lots of yummy chilly sour cream cheese and guacamole on tops. Very filly.\n\nThis place is an amazing beachy bar field. Very cute and relaxing.' u"I really liked this place. It's a very fun/laid back atmosphere. The music is a little loud but it was still good. Happy hour is great and goes until 8:30. Cocktails were only $6 - some beers were only $4. What??\n\nI had the mermaid x2 which is basically a frozen mojito. Very tasty.\n\nBartenders were busy but still friendly and attentive. This place will get packed!! But it opens at 5:30 so if you get there at 5:30 you will get a good spot. \n\n\nI would definitely come back here." u"Came here with a few friends right after work had to was a few minutes since they just opened. Since we were one of the first customers we found a seat easily. The fish tacos is to die for! Very fresh and tasty the fries are also a must! Drinks are pretty good I like Surfer Girl frozen mojito was a little too light. The bar gets very very crowded and busy. Granted it's about a 7 min walk from Times Square. \n\nPro:\nTaco Tuesdays! - Must try their fish tacos $4 each\nFrench fries - delicious! love the sauce it came with\nHH Drinks ~$6\n\nCons:\nCan get super crowded\nYou have to be aggressive when ordering your drinks/food. Not anyone fault just super busy during HH times\n\nSuper SoCal Vibe! Surf boards around the room feels like you just finished surfing and went to the bar after rinsing off. Oh the bar is downstairs. Be careful going down the stairs their kitchen is on the first floor and I almost got knocked over when the staff was bringing the food downstairs!" u"I give Reunion one star because of the following reasons:\n\n-  We arrived when Reunion opened and as soon as we sat down by the wall the couch smelled like vomit.  For someone like myself who has a bad sense of smell being able to smell vomit means that to others it probably smelled like sewage.  The couch should've been cleaned prior to opening time but it clearly weren't.  Another group sat on the other end of the couch and had the same complaint.  We all moved to the other room which was much better.  There was a fish tank at the back which was nice to look at.\n\n- Unfortunately when we ordered the waitress told us that the machine for frozen drinks was not working.  That was terrible news because most of the drinks on the menu were frozen and that severely limited our options.  So we ended up ordering other drinks which were pretty strong but didn't really taste that great.  We also got tacos which were decent.\n\n-  Later on it seemed that the machine was working again.  But we only knew that because the table next to us was told about that.  But why weren't we told?  So we called out to the waitress as she was walking away and she came back to our table.  When we asked if the machine was working again she said it was.  So we got the frozen drinks we initially wanted.\n\n- When we got the check the waitress told us that she would void out the first two drinks that we ordered due to the inconvenience.  She made it sound like she was doing a very nice thing for us.  We thanked her for doing that.  But in fact she actually meant she voided out the two frozen drinks that we couldn't order due to the broken machine.  Isn't it obvious that what we aren't able to order shouldn't be on the check??  But she acted like she was doing a great favor.\n\nAll in all I was very disappointed with our experience at Reunion.  I actually came with a group of friends last year and enjoyed it which was why we were excited to go two weeks ago.  But the experience was a letdown.  I would highly recommend to make sure everything is cleaned and fixed before the bar opens.  I would not come here again and would not recommend Reunion to anyone." u'Super fun beach vibes in this bar in a basement. Happy hour with decent pricing for drinks ($4 for beers $6 for frozen mixed drinks) and only one food item ($4 hot dog) except on Tuesday where tacos are included. The bar filled up within 10 min of opening thank goodness I was able to grab a table with coworkers or else we would be left standing the rest of the night. I wish there were more food options but the tots were alright and the hot dog was too salty. Left kind of bloated and wishing for some greens and fruit.' u'I just moved here from Florida and on the first coldest night of the year we decide to do happy hour at this surf bar. The ambiance is great and the decor really seems like a Florida bar even though you can still kinda feel that you\'re in a basement. The drink specials were great for happy hour. They have a beer and a shot special after that. 8 dollars for a 12oz beer and a shot. Food was actually pretty good and not too pricey. Probably cheap for the area. I had the hot dog (also in happy hour special) it has a dog dog and a strip of pork belly in it so very rich the slaw cut through it though so I liked it. "Tot-choes" were huge and everyone loved them. They\'re exactly what you expect. Hamburger was described as good by a friend. Mixed drinks tasted great. Earned 5 stars from me with the setting alone. Service was also awesome.' u"Remembered going here once for a friend's birthday after watching a game in the neighborhood so I suggested this as a possible spot for a couple of post dinner drinks.  I was a little put off/worried about what I was getting in to when we walked up and the bouncer was a girl sitting in a life guard tower on the sidewalk outside.  I was relieved as we descended down the stairs to see a nice crowd for a Thursday night but plenty of available seats.  \n\nWe got the menu and I was so excited to see that my favorite tiki drink The Jungle Bird was now featured on the menu (I had to ask the bartender to make it for me off menu last time when I saw they had all the ingredients for it and after checking the recipe on his phone he did).  Bartender mixed a delicious well balanced drink.  My date started of with the Suffering Bastard which was good and refreshing but very ginger forward.  He was jealous of my delicious drink so make his second a Jungle Bird as well.\n\nReally enjoyed the couple drinks we had there they were tasty and well made.  The space was cute and the music was good it is a very nice escape from over crowded or cheesy Hells Kitchen/Times Square bars.  I will definitely come back." u'Great happy hour until 10pm. Got the mermaid (frozen mojito) and my friend got the Paloma (tequila lime and grapefruit soda I believe) both for $6 each. So worth! Very delicious and amazing price for NYC standards. Such a cute place too. Surfer theme ~^_^~ def want to come back to try the other drinks. Talked to another couple who said the fish taco was phenomenal so be on the look out for that!' u"Well first make sure you read their signs if you have never been there I walked right past it not knowing. The entrance looks like an typical nyc parking lot entrance but when you enter it takes you right down to the restaurant. Pretty cool.\n\nThe decorations are awesome especially the entrance into the ladies restroom. Just wish they had a little more lighting around the dinning tables.\n\nI went there solely for their happy hour which last from 5:30pm to 10pm with an average cocktail costing only $6. My waitstress recommend the paloma (a fake margarita I assume) and it was delicious. I didn't care much for the screwdriver because they used Orange Crush soda instead of actual orange juice.\n\nSince I wasn't super hungry I got the tots with veggie chillies and it came with a heaping amount of guacamole on top (not a guacamole gal at all). It doesn't state that it comes with guac on the menu (they need to change it). But the tots were good greasy cheesy and saucy. Had to share it with my friend. She also ordered some type of corn dish that comes served in a Chinese take out bowl. The corn was sweet a Lil spicey. \n\nOverall I loved the place. Nice waitstaff and good vibes all around. If you want the best out of the happy come in at 6pm and leave at 12am which what I did." u'If you have a fake ID this is the hot spot because the place is crawling with young kids who barely look legal. Drinks look pretty and run at around $12-15 which is "cheap" for NYC but not that cheap for drinks that taste like absolute garbage. I don\'t know why I ever decided to get the "coco loco" which is a basic pi\xf1a colada but I was just craving one since the photos on Yelp made it look good. It tasted horrific there was such a lack of flavor so the well liquor was overpowering. My cousin also got a drink that she hated. Music was way too loud to hold any sort of conversation and they turned it up even louder for no reason. It\'s not like there was a dance floor at that time (10:30 pm). The bartender was nice though.' u"A surf bar that's so tucked away you'd likely walk right past the entrance if it weren't for the large sky blue lifeguard chair at the door. \n\nI get what Reunion is trying to do - create a laid-back beachy/boozy scene in the middle of NYC. But it didn't really work for me. \n\nFirst the bar is located in a basement so there's zero natural light. It actually reminded me more of the dungeon in a GoT episode than a beach. \n\nSecond the noise. It gets crowded and loud. This is probably fine if you're into that sort of thing but the older I get the more I detest waiting in a mosh-pit of sweaty people for a drink.\n\nI also need to add that there is only one bartender (at least on the night I came). He was as attentive as one can be when making drinks for the entire establishment and taking care of his customers at the bar. I'd much rather be drinking though not spending most of my time here waiting.\n\nThey have happy hour specials but most of those are mixed drinks. Tuesday they have $4 tacos but come on any other day and the only taco special involves a heaping mound of tator-tots smothered in salsa and guac.\n\nI tried the pork tacos and they were delicious but pricey for just two small tacos.\n\nGo here if you're in your 20's single and love yelling over loud music just to talk to your date/friends." u"Awesome spot for happy hour. \n\nEntrance- look for the secret door on the left and walk down a couple set of stair cases\n\nHappy hour drinks- select shots for $3 cocktails are $6 and pilsner $4. Mermaid cocktail- frozen mojito with lots of mint. Paloma- taste like a sour margarita \n\nTaco Tuesday- $4/piece. Loved the pork carnitas taco. Served as a whole piece of pork instead of shredded with lots of flavor. \n\nAmbiance- California surfer shack-like feel. Brings me back to the west coast. Extra seating near the women's restroom. Plenty of hooks to hang up coats. \n\nService- understaffed but on point." u"My friend is a regular here so I decided to tag along one day to see why he loves this bar so much. I was a bit skeptical because I couldn't imagine how a place could pull off a West Coast/beach theme in the city (especially in the winter). However I was wrong and when I walked into the bar I felt like I was in California because the interior is very well done. We came for happy hour which starts at 5:30 pm and were lucky enough to secure a table for our group. \n\nAlthough busy the bartenders are very attentive and are super efficient. They have a cool selection of cocktails on their happy hour menu! I ordered the Surfer Girl and a shot of the acid drop and they were stronger than I expected (a good thing of course). The Surfer Girl is like a screwdriver except that it has orange soda. The acid drop comes in a shot glass with a sugar rim and the vodka is grapefruit based. My friends ordered some food but I don't remember what they ate. \n\nOverall this place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back!" u"I give this bar five stars because the mixed drinks are well made bartenders are professional and good at what they do and the fish tacos are surprisingly delicious! \n\nFries are cooked well done nice and crispy with a delicious dipping sauce. \n\nThe crowd here are all in their late 20s - so really note this. Around happy hour (like most bars) EXTREMELY PACKED. I went here for a going away happy hour celebration. \n\nI called ahead of time to see if they had tacos and the woman was very professional and stepped into her office to take the call. For a bar/venue I thought this was very respectable. \n\nWhat made me laugh was the woman in the front in a beach chair checking IDs. She was so cute and welcoming. I couldn't imagine people trying to give her a difficult time. I envision those huge bouncers outside the typical midtown bars." u'When the snow finally subsided from the recent storm in NYC what better way to warm up than a trip to a surf themed bar? \n\nWe found this place on Yelp while visiting the city and man am I glad we did. This bar is the real deal. Friendly staff great drinks good snacks and a fun theme combine to make this a memorable place to visit. \n\nWe stayed for a couple hours and I had three drinks in total. I tried one of the coconut-based drinks as well as two of the surfer dudes which was essentially a screwdriver with orange soda mixed in. Most drinks here are rum based but you\'ll see some other options mixed in. They offer a good selection of frozen drinks as well which is what my friends got. Also try the "acid drop" shot - its grapefruit and comes with a sugar coated rim. Really good. \n\nDrinks run around $13 dollars which for how strong they are isn\'t a bad price. Food is pretty cheap as well. The decor is inviting and fits the theme. There are surfboards lots of tropical colors and other similar items. There are multiple rooms for seating but we sat at the bar during our visit. \n\nOverall I highly recommend stopping here for a drink if you get the chance!' u"If you're expecting to be dazzled then don't bother coming here. Instead Reunion is a cute little underground bar with extended happy hour deals (8pm) cute drinks and a relaxing atmosphere to chill in. Their theme is fun and cheeky while their girly drinks match their Hawaiian motif. \n\nThe bartender was great! Despite the crowd he handled his cool and was attentive to our needs. The drinks was not as strong as I would have liked but it was definitely pretty looking so that was a plus. However their short ribs tacos was only okay. Despite it being plentiful with the short ribs my taco didn't really taste like a taco. Instead it tasted like a toss salad with meat on the bottom.  The most criminalizing of all is that it lacked seasonings and sauce (hence why they lost their extra star). \n\nOverall I would still recommend this place only if you're looking for a quick hang out or to kill time while waiting for a show in Time Square. However I'm not sure if Reunion has long lasting appeals for me to wanna come back just so I can hang out for the entire evening." u"Tiki bar style restaurant/hangout place with happy hour drinks weekday 5-7pm and taco tuesday specials. Some tacos are $4. Tacos are a little smaller than the size of your hand. My favs are fish and pork belly. \n\nNot sure if this is always the case but when my friend and I went on a Tuesday around 5pm it was not very crowded but service was incredibly slow. Ordered 2 drinks and 2 tacos waited about 15 minutes for our drinks. About an hour in tacos were still missing so we ended up canceling the order because we had a show to catch. Server was helpful and apologetic but it was very hectic because she was helping ten other parties or so. \n\nQuite a disappointment because other Yelpers seemed to have enjoyed their experience but I didn't find it spectacular. Drinks were nothing memorable and prices are standard." u'My friends and I are visiting NYC for Spring Break and were looking for a bar not too far from our hotel but not touristy or located in a hotel. We found this one through Yelp and loved the reviews and the theme. So we trudged through the aftermath of "winter storm" Stella and came here. \n\nThe bar is located downstairs and you stop by the lifeguard station to show your ID.  There are two main seating areas the one around the bar and another off to the side. \n\nThe decor is surfer themed and it\'s so fun! They have lots of little signs that don funny saying like "must be this tall to ride bartender." \n\nThe drinks average about $13 and are very tropical themed. The selection of rum is quite impressive as well. The food is tasty and not too pricey. \n\nReunion takes its surfer theme above and beyond and is a treat for New Yorkers or visitors alike. Would totally return next vist!' u"This is a basement bar with a kitschy surfer atmosphere. Not really representative of N.Y. especially being so close to Times Square. \n\nThe crowd is fun and friendly but it's a bit hot and humid here because if outside weather. \n\nThe drinks are as kitschy as the atmosphere but they have tater tots and our server is really great and attentive but not overbearing. \n\nDid I mention they have tater tots?" u"Keeping it short.\n\nUnderground caribbean-themed dive bar.\n\nIf not for reeking of vomit the sticky counters and chairs the overworked bartender and the bathroom with no running water it's great."],0.0721,0.081,0.847,0.072
151.Financier Patisserie,[u'Everything here was fantastic! The line was a bit long but went quickly. The baguette and croissants were really quite good and they give you more than ample butter to go with it. The pastries and sandwiches were also enjoyable. Pricey but so totally worth it and grab a smoothie to wash it all down. Would definitely go back when in town again.' u"Pros: great pastry selection coffee accompanied with a piece of small cookie. Cons: absolutely nowhere to sit inside.\n\nDidn't order any coffee so cannot speak of that; but I liked my green tea (perfect temperature as lots of place the temperature of water was super high). Wish they could expand a bit..." u"Amazing treats. We hit them up as we were about to head back to Times Square. \nI usually roll right on by these places. So glad we didn't. \n\nWhen we finished...we immediately wanted more. Each treat was roughly $5. No big deal. \n\nMay have to check em out again before we head home." u"There is a older lady who works in the morning that is rude. She counts the cash with a manager? right on the counter in front of the customers. Then she hand motions me come up the next customer in line as if she couldn't be bothered. Then she puts down the coffee without saying thank you. And she doesn't give me the free small pound cake. I just stand there looking at her and she pulls one out of the basket while looking away. I have to reach and grab it out of her hand. Not a good experience." u"I'm so extremely disappointed! I love their Frasier cake and purchased it on multiple occasions. Yesterday evening I bought it for my brother's birthday got home gathered the family and opened the box... the cake had spoiled strawberries in it and on it!!! Check out the pictures Disgusting & embarrassing. We tried to take out the strawberries from the side and actually eat the cake but buttercream had more strawberries mixed in and it smelled bad so we threw it out.\n\nCalled the store the next morning and they told me their cakes are delivered fresh each morning to bring the cake back to investigate. PLZ! New York was hit with a huge snow storm on Tuesday (bough the cake Wednesday evening) and most likely I was sold leftover cake from the day before. \n\nUpdate: Shelby from corporate called me to apologize did not offer refund. She reassured me the cake was baked that morning and this was due to the fact that strawberries are not in season. Great - don't have fresh strawberries? don't make the cake! \n\nAfter asking for a refund I was told I can't get one because I threw out the receipt. Called my bank to get a refund & then received a call that bakery was unsuccessfully trying to fight the charge back lol" u"11/01/2016 / around 4pm when it wasn't busy in the cafe. The latte they served me here is horrendous. The milk was boiling temperature and sour. No complimentary Madeline." u'Decent pastries at decent prices however the staff was rude and not particularly helpful.' u"Small hot chocolate with whip cream medium latte and 3 macaroons. \n\nHot chocolate didn't come with whip cream (they forgot) latte was about 50% foam and no where near filled to the top macaroons were delicious.  If going for a macaroon I'd definitely try the raspberry!" u"I have bought many cakes here for friends' birthdays and they all taste scrumptious. I LOVE their black & white cake. It might be a little hard to find this place as it is in a passageway going through 48th to 47th street. The cakes all look so beautiful and there are also these little sampler cakes that are SO CUTE. They also have big macarons! The staff here are also very pleasant. I sometimes order cakes very last minute for pick up but they never gave me a problem. However if you want the cake to be personalized with someone's name you will have to give them 24hr advanced notice. There is also an outdoor seating area if you would like to sit there and enjoy your coffee and a pastry before running off to work." u"Sat outside on a covered patio between to buildings. It was raining but didn't matter as we were protected.  We  drank a cup of Black very strong coffee eating a scone. Great staff behind counter." u"Five star review for their giant ass macarons haha!!!i have this addiction to macarons because they are just sooo delightful and the point that they are French makes them even better. Honestly I wasn't even expecting much from this place because I've never heard of it before and no one was here when I came. \nHowever their bigggg macarons are cheap  only$3 I think and it's GOOOD \n\nI didn't eat it right away in fact I put it in the refrigerator for like two days so I really thought it was going to be bad but it was amazing! \n\nPerfect crust not empty (huge thing to look for in macarons) and perfect filling. COME HERE FOR MACARONS RIGHT NOW!" u"Overall it was an okay experience. I had the chocolate croissant and iced chai latte. The iced chai latte wasn't good at all and I ended up not finishing it. The chocolate croissant was a bit rubbery but the actual chocolate inside was actually very good - it was a bit on the darker chocolate side which I very much appreciated. But again overall it was just an okay experience." u'So I came here right before seeing "Chicago" and got this strawberry short cake. I wasn\'t sure what the exact name was but it consisted of vanilla biscuit at the bottom and mousseline and fresh strawberries. The cream was already semi-solid - again I\'m not sure if that was supposed to be the case - and the biscuit didn\'t come off with the rest of the cake =( \n\nCustomer service wasn\'t that great even though I was being friendly. I got a sense that the lady behind the counter was giving me an attitude as I was taking my time browsing. There wasn\'t even a line as it was almost 8pm.' u"Pros:\n-Nearly all of the cakes that they have taste pretty good. \n-It's close to my office so if we need to get a cake for someone's birthday we just run across the street to Financier. \n-The chocolate mousse cakes are the best.\n-There's seating next to the bakery. I never use it but FYI. \n\nCons:\n-I do not understand why they ask for a tip of at least 10% when you buy a cake. All they did was greet me pull a cake out from behind the counter stuff it in a box and ran up the cash register. \n\nTips (no pun intended): \n-Always ask for plates (if you get a cake) BEFORE paying. No tip ($5 to $6) no plates." u"Used to be my neighborhood coffee shop and I went everyday for 1.5 years. Needless to say - I love the place.\n\nReasons I like it so much are the coffee. It tastes good and under $2 for a small cafe au lait. You also get a little cookie with every purchase which is a nice way to start the day.\n\nThe pastries always look great. I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I didn't buy them often but do love looking at them.\n\nThere are these little pastries (choquette) that are available only on Thursdays and Fridays. They are small and light and u can get them in bulk. My coworkers liked them a lot. If you want to try them you need to get there early because they run out.\n\nGood place for cakes. All the office birthday cakes used to come from there. My favorites are the cheese cake and berry tart. For specific cakes we had to either order them in advance or get them early in the morning. This location gets it's delivery once a day and by noon the good pastries are mostly gone." u'Very cool little snack shop.  Sandwiches to pastry and drinks. Out door seating with roof over alley between 2 streets.   Prices are average.  Theaters right down the block.  Great before or after a show' u"The selection of pastry's is excellent. They are significantly better than what is available at Starbucks. A thumbs up to the macarons. The selection of coffee and chai is also reasonable. The prices are comparable to Starbucks so definitely worth giving it a try." u"It's absolutely terrible that I found Financier by my work. I am now addicted to their large banana caramel macaroon. I need to remind myself not to go when they're freshly stocked in the morning because I immediately want to buy their cakes - Apple Honey??? Other beautiful cakes whose names I can't remember right now?? I can't... \n\nThey also have this mini cake - chocolate pear and walnut. It made me almost cry when I saw it. It was so good.\n\nThe staff is also very nice. (Really they're nice. I worked retail and I was refreshed by such genuinely pleasant moods that they exuded).\n\nI just wish this place has a frequent buyer system. Buy x macaroons and receive a free macaroon. Spend x dollars and get x credit." u'The macaron was very good and only $3 for a large macaron. Better than $2 for a tiny one. One macaron is a good light breakfast. The coffee was OK. I got a cappuccino and it tasted a little watery and flavorless to me. I also enjoy black espresso so it could just be my taste in coffee. The stronger the better! I really enjoyed their outdoor seating area. It was a cool day yesterday and perfect for drinking coffee outdoors. Overall it is a good price for midtown NYC and I would go back again.' u"I've been to other Financiers and they are much much better!!! These guys try but not hard at all. Out of maybe 10 small soy lattes I have ordered about three were decent the rest were either too burnt too bitter not small and a couple were not soy. Pastries: they are good. I however made a mistake (twice) of taking several to go. I'm guessing that it was in a noble effort to preserve the environment they were jammed in one box. It's a good thing those pastries were bought for consumption by folks that care about taste and not the appearance as they have totally lost the appeal from being all squashed together. I thought about getting lunch there as I used enjoy Financier quiches very much but thought it might be another fiasco and desired against it. I'm glad Zibetto just opened up in my building - I hear they have good coffee."],0.7096,0.33,0.67,0.0
58.Parker & Quinn,[u"Came here for a quick fast lunch.\n\nGreat burger - great bun!\n\nI'd go back!" u"Parker & Quinn is a pretty decent spot for a sit down meal in midtown in an area where such a place is lacking. It has a retro diner/saloon vibe and is operated at the back of the Refinery Hotel. It has a central bar and variety of seating options including booths tables and high tables with funky red leather stools. The restrooms are beautiful and located in the hotel lobby which is easily accessed once you walk past the kitchen.\n\nI've been here for both a weekday lunch and a weekday breakfast. The lunch service was pretty busy while the weekday breakfast was pretty quiet. I ordered a veggie burger at the lunch. It was sizeable and decent not the best I've ever had but reasonable for such a place. The server was alright not particularly attentive. She seemed busy. I recall thinking it took a very long time for the food/drinks to come out. The place was fairly full but still.\n\nThe second time I ordered an acai bowl. I wasn't really a fan of this because it was basically liquefied when it came out so that all of the fresh fruit/granola had sunk and I needed to dig it out. It kind of had an aftertaste of dairy yoghurt. I could be wrong because the yoghurt was not mentioned on the menu and acai bowls are typically dairy free. But I'm not sure what they blended it with because if it had have been frozen banana it would have been much more solid. And thus yoghurt does make sense.\n\nDuring this breakfast my friends ordered a big breakfast and a waffle (they were out of pancakes). I paid the bill and it ended up being over $100 for 3 people. My portion was only about $25. My friends ordered juice and coffee and some of their other add ons to be pretty steep. $8 for a side of bacon and $6 to add berries and cream to the waffles. That seemed to be all the waffles came with so I'm assuming it would have been $16 odd bucks for plain waffle and syrup if they hadn't made the add on. Regardless they were really happy with their meals.\n\nThe server for breakfast was pretty good. She was friendly helpful and had a sense of humor. I think the food was also a tad slow considering it was fairly quiet. Had to follow up on the bill and paying. But they probably assumed we were tourists and not people who were going to work.\n\nWould I come back again? Yes. I'd be more keen for drinks than a substantial meal. I think it errs on a little expensive. Their target customer is probably not a vegan/vegetarian health nut. I do think the vibe here is nice. It is a great place to sit down in the area and the look and feel is classy and chic." u'A nice spot for an upscale brunch.\n\nBrought my family here when they were in town. We wanted a classic American breakfast and we were (mostly) satisfied with what we got here. I say mostly because I was disappointed with my omelet... it was $17 and was so cheap tasting. Besides my order my mom and sister enjoyed their french toast and breakfast sandwiches.\n\nI rate Parker & Quinn higher than the experience I had with my food because the restaurant has a luxurious vibe that makes everything taste better.\n\n-- \ntaste / 3\naesthetics / 4\nvibe / 5\nservice / 5\nprice for quality / 2\nOVERALL / 4' u"This place is near Bryant park so it's a good brunch place and then a nice walk in nature.\n\nWe got the crab cakes and waffles to share amongst two. The crab cakes were delicious but the presentation of the waffle was a bit underwhelming. It looked like a nice waffle made out at my house with a waffle iron. \n\nThe service was good water refilled promptly and sharing plates were offered. Maybe the underwhelming presentation of the waffle is just limited to that dish as the pictures on yelp look quite good." u'Made reservations for a weekend brunch (Sat @11am) just a day beforehand. Easy peasy! When we arrived it was busy but not crowded. We were seated immediately and food came out really fast! \n\nOur server was helpful giving us some specific recommendations as opposed to the usual (and unhelpful) "everything\'s great!" \n\nMy friend got the Acai Bowl and enjoyed how refreshing it was. A big plus for the great textures going on - with a fun mixture of granola fresh berries bananas and chocolate! \n\nI got the recommended Mushroom Omelette and thought it was just alright. There are 2 camps for omelette lovers: Camp 1 for those that like the toppings/ingredients tossed in with the eggs and Camp 2 for those that like the egg to be separated and serve almost like a case for the toppings. I\'m a happy member of Camp 1 so I was a little disappointed that my omelette was more like an egg burrito for the mushrooms. the eggs themselves were fluffy but almost tasted artificial. The texture was very reminiscent of the types of omelettes I would be served on long international flights - just abnormally thick and soft. The filling was a combo of mushroom and gruyere with a light sprinkling of tomatoes. It felt a bit too oily for my taste and I didn\'t love it. \n\nOverall not the best brunch option in the city but def a good find if you\'re looking for a fast stress-free meal.' u'It was my last day in NYC (Saturday AM) and my flight was leaving early and I found this place around the corner from my hotel that opened at 7am and served "Brunch" on  Saturday Morning..not heard of and I might add a "novel idea" and "wake up" call to other restaurants who refuse to open their doors for "Brunch" earlier than 10am on a Saturday.\n\nPhenomenal Crab Cake Eggs Benedict Duo...HUGE...I mean...ABSOLUTELY HUGE...amount of lump crab cake atop freshly saut\xe9ed spinach in which there was a perfectly poached egg atop of each crab cake with hollandaise sauce...all of this was lifted atop what appeared to be a house made English Muffin....."Pure Paradise!"\n\nI also ordered:\n\nA Bloody Mary-which was JUST OK=did not finish-disappointed with the garnish...\n\nFresh Squeezed Orange Juice=Perfect\n\nYukon Potatoes=Huge Portion and Excellent\n\nA special thanks to the bartender/server-Blanca...who checked in on me and was very professional and attentive....\n\nFYI-\n\nOdd place in that when you entered-the staff seemed to be congregating within the bar area and not really "doing" their job of "Meet and Greet" in fact at one time...there was an echoing of glass falling on the floor and breaking followed by a yelp exclaiming "Bar Karma!" which was entertaining..but odd...' u'Nice and friendly spot in midtown - stopped in for a last-minute meal and really enjoyed the evening. Cool that they could get us a table for 3 as a walk in on a busy Wednesday night. \n\nHad oysters (East and West) which were delicious and really loved the octopus appetizer. So tender and delicious. Also had the Brussels sprouts which was like deep fried something in sweet & sour sauce. Across the table the meatballs were a hit.\n\nCool vibe good spot and really had a nice time.' u"So I really wanted to give this place a higher rating. The food is OK and the service is friendly but also a little indifferent. Here is what I mean: we arrived an hour before our reservation and they accommodated us I will bring it up. Easy to do as this was a Sunday morning at 8:30 AM and the place was less than half-full. They gave plenty of time to order as we were waiting for my daughter to join us. But here's the thing our waitress was friendly but I had to ask her each time I wanted a warm-up for my coffee. Elsewhere in the country it is the practice to have someone go around with a pot of coffee offering refills but here they take your cup and refill it at some station out of sight.\n\nThe bakers basket is 4 pastries and is supposed to come with butter but it did not. \n\nThe Side order of bacon was a good portion but arrived warm rather than hot and quickly got cold.\n\nRoasted vegetable omelette rather than having next vegetables inside instead was an omelette placed over roasted vegetables.\n\nThe blackberries in the berry medley were excellent but at nine dollars for less than a half pint of berries I would expect the raspberries and strawberries and blueberries to be perfect as well. \n\nWell this review may sound negative but I would go back to this place for lunch or dinner. I bet they do a burger or steak pretty well." u'Great ambiance and friendly efficient service. \nHad the waffle French toast poached eggs and side of bacon. All perfectly cooked. A little pricey for breakfast but a good experience.' u'We were billeted at the refinery and this is one of their 3 restaurants on the property. Having been too lazy to walk under the rain we opted to try and have breakfast here. We ordered just basics coffeetea oatmeal yogurt and grits. Taste is underwhelming. The grits were totally dry and doesnt seem to be freshly made.   I expected the price to be higher than the usual breakfast joint but at least try to make it more palatable.  Food needs improvement.' u"Service was great; our waitress was friendly and attentive.  If you're thinking of getting dessert order the cookie skillet.  It was incredible. \n\nPrices were a little higher than I anticipated but I had a nice experience overall." u"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The place was pretty full and I didn't have a reservation. Just me and one other person and it took about 10 minutes to be seated but we had a small little high top which was fine but I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time just in case. The decor and ambience of the restaurant/bar was very nice looking. \n\nThe lunch menu has a good amount of options and I was very tempted with multiple different meals to order. I haven't read a ton of reviews for here so I didn't know what to except really but was very pleasantly surprised. We ended up going with the meatballs as the appetizer. Honestly they were mouthwatering. I could have kept eating them if I had more. For our meal we both ended up going with the French dip sandwich. Also went out of my norm here with the shredded steak being the meat on the sandwich. But it was literally so good. The meat was also mouthwatering like the meatballs. I chose the French fries as my side which did not disappoint at all. \n\nOverall no complaints for Parker & Quinn. I especially recommend it if you work in midtown and are looking for a longer lunch or special occasion lunch." u'Excellent. Loved the decor - French bistro and English pub combined.  Service and wait staff attentiveness was just the right level.  Lucky enough to get raised banquette seating - just right for 4.  Be sure to do reservations.  Warm olives - nice simple starter.  Sorbet was a good close-out.  Main course was burger and fries - fresh and cooked just right.' u"Great brunch.   Nice atmosphere good service eclectic sound track.\nMy husband enjoyed the smoked salmon platter (classic NY bagel) and I had the smoked salmon flatbread which I highly recommend.   Probably the best thing I've eaten in a long while." u'Got there and was able to get seated right away at a high top with a reservation. Ambiance was beautiful very chic somewhat mid century meets Art Deco. Started with a glass of rose which the server let me trade taste of complementary. We decided to get the kale salad and a cheeseburger which were both pretty good. I got the burger which was perfectly cooked with fries and my mom got the kill salad. I thought the kale salad was just OK but she seem to enjoy it very much. Manager came by to check on us at the end of our meal and was super friendly; wanted to make sure everything was perfect which overall it was a great experience. Bill came to about $60 with the tip which seems a little pricey for what we got but then again it is NYC.' u"Francesca the manager was amazing and attentive! \n\nShe checked up on our table and even took the time to find out where we were from and what brought us there. \n\nRarely do you find these days customer service like this from a manager! I was deeply impressed! And would be back in a heart beat! \n\nThe food was fantastic! And the staff super friendly. \n\nI would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great Italian eats! The burrata appetizer was out of this world! Pasta perfectly al dente and I didn't have anything I didn't like! \n\nA must try if you're in the area!!! They also have open table reservations to make it easy to book a table before you arrive." u'I found a nice Brunch spot near Bryant Park I was excited to check them out. The restaurant opens to a large bar area. The bar was very pretty and came with few TV screens. There are bar stools all around the bar and there are more seating by the window. To the right of the bar was booth tables and beyond the bar was more dining area with tables and booth seating.\n\nFor food we had Malted Waffle and Steak & Eggs. They were both really tasty better than I expected. The portion was good too. Worth every penny!\n\nThe bathroom is shared with the Refinery hotel and they are directly in front of the door of the restaurant. They had several uni-sex bathrooms with very cool signs on the door.\n\nThe brunch was a success we had a really nice meal here. Our server Rachel was very nice friendly and helpful. They had a manager (?) on the floor and she was really nice and helpful also. We were well taken care of and we really enjoyed the food more so than we expected. I am happy we discovered another awesome place to have brunch! And yes they are open for breakfast lunch and dinner also and most certainly cocktails. Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl.' u'"The bartender is really cute!" I thought to myself as I blushed and ordered a virgin mojito due to my Asian alcohol tolerance. He smiled and made me a refreshing glass with the perfect measure of mint & lime. A few minutes later my friends arrived. Before being seated for our dinner reservation I asked to close the tab. "Oh don\'t worry about it" he said "it\'s just a virgin drink." I blushed again. Not a bad start to my first experience at PQ.\n\nThe 4 of us were seated in a cozy elevated booth. Our waiter was MIA for too long before taking our food order which made me a tad hangry. My mushroom flatbread was loaded with fresh & juicy mushrooms. The squid ink spaghetti was on point in texture & flavour. The burgers were devoured without an offer to share with yours truly so clearly delish. The warm gooey Trademark chocolate chip cookie was served in a skillet and topped with ice cream - perfect for sharing.\n\nThe ambiance is laid-back yet classy - great for all sorts of personal & professional occasions. I will be back if only to order a drink from the cute bartender ... a real drink this time.' u"I tried to make reservations via Open Table for 2 people on Monday at 12PM and the earliest available was 1:45. My friend and I risked our chances and arrived at 12PM and was able to get seated right away. The restaurant was fairly empty at the time but quickly filled up with reservations by the time we left.\n\nI had the chilled corn Maine lobster chili and scallion oil soup for $14 which was fairly interesting. It is cold like gazpacho but has the creaminess of a bisque. I couldn't really taste any corn but I did come across small chunks of lobster. The chili and scallion oil is drizzled on top so be sure to mix it in since it's spicy. My friend made the mistake of not mixing it in and coughed from the spiciness.\n\nFor my entree I had the wild king salmon for $28. It was beautifully done - the skin was super crispy and the portion size was decent. It was paired with a delicious pea sauce and wild mushrooms on the bottom. On top it was covered with alfalfa sprouts which I find incredibly hard to eat elegantly so I left those mostly untouched.\n\nService was great - my waitress and the manager both checked in with us a few times (this was before they got busy). Everything came out in a timely manner.\n\nThe funny quirk of this place is that it's located on the ground floor attached to a hotel so the bathroom is part of the hotel." u'Made reservations for a group of 7 on Thursday evening. The entrance is the bar area and it was filled with people who were probably there for happy hour/waiting for available tables. It was pretty packed for a Thursday. Two friends were running late but they seated us first in the back corner. \n\nI ordered the squid ink spaghetti (side dish size) an order of fries and a glass of Rose. They offer the pastas in two sizes: side $16 or regular entree $26. The portion they give you is palm sized. There are a few pieces of squid on top and a wedge of lemon on the side. This dish was flavorful and the lemony taste complimented the dish well. \n\nThe eggplant french fries were delicious. I usually stay away from eggplant because of the texture but the way they made it was perfectly fried and tasty especially with the sauce they provide. \n\nService was nice but we felt a little rushed by the waiters to leave. The food here is pretty solid but my friends and I agreed that it was not worth for the prices they demand.'],0.727,0.336,0.59,0.074
200.Dim Sum Palace,[u"My absolute go to for delivery via seamless after consistently bad experiences with a Murray Hill ~competitor~.\n\nI always get a vegetable dish and they're always consistent-not too greasy a little bit too salty (can't be helped) and always generous with the mushrooms. This place is obsessed with mushrooms. They include it in the pea shoots in the lotus root in every vegetable dish that isn't just the greens with garlic. \n\nSteamed fish is decent but TINY for $33~ish and the duck is decent not amazing but just fine." u'A decent and affordable dim sum place near by Times Square.\n\nWe are happy to find Thu place. It is located relatively close to Times Square and the Central Park. If you are craving for a Chinese or dim sum try this place' u"Tried out Dim Sum Palace via Seamless and was not let down! I've had my eye on this restaurant for a while and finally got around to giving it a try. I'm a big fan of dim sum and was happy to see that their menu had a lot of options all at a very affordable price. \n\nBecause I wanted to try a variety of their dumplings I went with the Palace Dim Sum Platter which contains 8 pieces. I wasn't sure if this would be enough food so I also threw in a vegetarian hot and sour soup for good measure. The food came incredibly quick (about 20 min) despite the 30-45 min estimated delivery window. \n\nAfter eating my meal I'm incredibly full and happy. The platter came with quite a good mix of options and a few sauces to dip them in. The menu didn't list what was in the dumplings in the platter so it was fun to just see what was inside each. The soup was also very big for $3.25 and I wasn't even able to finish it but it was great!\n\nDefinitely will order (and hopefully someday come eat at) Dim Sum Palace again! Looking forward trying some of their other dishes and maybe even their chicken feet." u'Delicious food but not what I would call authentic-tasting.\n\nAs the second location of a family-owned Chinese restaurant I\'m assuming the first one had to be successful enough for this one to open. My bf & I walked in for dinner on a Saturday night and we were quickly seated (no wait time!). The menu was expansive offering a variety of dim sum (of course) and your typical Chinese fare. We opted for the chicken & broccoli Mongolian beef and shrimp & chive dumplings.\n\nThe dumplings were delicious juicy and well-steamed and I can\'t wait to come back for actual dim sum. The other dishes were great both taste and texture-wise although a bit heavily sauced for Chinese fare. The waiters were attentive consistently filling our waters and the restaurant was dim & intimate--perfect for date night or calm celebratory dinner. \n\nI could see my Chinese grandparents complaining about how the food they cook is superior and that whatever they\'re eating isn\'t "real" Chinese food if I brought them here but as far as my taste buds go I\'m a fan.' u"Great dim sum place that wasn't greasy! They had a great selection of dim sum that you order off a sheet (no push carts where the food gets cold). They had a delicious xo pan fried white turnip cake that I would come back for! \n\nA tip for tourists eat here for the Chinese food and only go to Chinatown for the experience!" u"Great dim sum in a convenient midtown location but at higher prices. I would say it's about 2x what you'd pay for a meal in Chinatown or Flushing but I appreciated not having to spend half of my Saturday in the subway. \n\n(Can I just say how much dim sum I've been downing lately? Part of that is a result of working so close to Chinatown and part of it is just I'm a dim sum fiend. I would eat this every day if the massive amount of carbs didn't make me feel so terrible after.) \n\nYES:\nComplimentary sauces: I really liked mixing the spicy and garlic ones. \nPickled garlic and sesame oil cucumber. \nChinese broccoli with oyster sauce. \nBuns with sweet egg yolk: You absolutely have to order one or two of these. Served piping hot the buns are a perfect dessert. They're not too sweet but I prefer them even over the egg tarts. \nShrimp rolls. \n\nNO: \nHong Kong-style fried noodles: my boyfriend absolutely loved this but it left me kind of cold. The noodles were your ordinary ramen noodles that turned really soggy and mealy after sitting in the sauce for too long. \nCrab pork soup dumplings: meh. They had a good amount of soup inside but I wasn't a fan of having to wipe all the oil from my lips. Also not too much crab flavor. \n\nFriendly service so another (+) in DSP's column versus all the other Chinatown dim sum joints. There was a lively party in the private room and a good trickle of business but no line for a weekend lunch." u'The food was delicious! It was all so fresh tasting. The pork shu mai was the best comparable to what I had in Asia. The vegetable lo mein was also extremely delicious! Would highly recommend!' u'Recommendation: Shrimp Dumpling Chicken Feet BBQ Pork Buns.\n\nThe surface of Shrimp Dumpling is tough. BBQ Pork Buns are tasty. \n\nI think most of its food is Hong Kong-style enough.' u"This is the second Dim Sum Palace location and it opened very recently. The restaurant interior is larger than I had expected. My party was also seated very quickly even though it was busy.\n\nThey have a wide variety of teas you can choose from but keep in mind it's not complimentary and you pay per pot. Overall prices are higher than traditional dimsum but standard for its Midtown location. \n\nI came here for dimsum on a Saturday. They provided three sauces for the dishes (soy sauce garlic and spicy). Overall I was much more impressed with the food here than at the original restaurant. All of the dishes were steaming hot and came out quickly. The wait staff was also very attentive. \n\nI would definitely come back to try some more dishes when I don't want to commute too far for dimsum." u"The food was excellent. I forgot my credit card at home and the owner let me give her the number and the expiration date. She told me to go get the money and come back and It was okay but I couldn't do that to her. Highly recommend!" u'Came in as a group of 20+. Good food and very fresh. Just a bit pricy compared to other dim sum places.' u'Not quite as good as the original but still great. This location is a bit more convenient as it\'s in the heart of upper-midtown. Menu is the same seating is less cramped and atmosphere is a bit nicer. My go-to is still the salted fish with chicken and tofu claypot. It is EXCELLENT though it is served sizzling at the 46th street location and is not so here. \n\nDim Sum is half off from 3-5. Tea is $8 though you can ask for "regular tea" and that\'s complimentary. It is a littler pricier than your standard Chinese restaurant but I\'m actually in favor of this as I think it\'s good practice to charge and pay for higher quality food! \n\nDim Sum wise I recommend the BBQ pork buns (steamed) and the custard egg buns for dessert. The coconut jello/cakes are also good and the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are not bad.' u"For those wondering this is the exact same as the Dim Sum Palace off of 8th Ave they just capitalized on the location and evident demand. I was so confused when it came up twice on my Yelp search I thought it was a mistake. In any case these people are a god send this is as good of Dim Sum as you'll find in Manhattan nestled in the heart of Midtown at such a reasonable price!\n\nFood is on par with the original location although I think I like the other spot better since the interior is nicer. However this place is nice as well and closer to my hotel. All day dim sum is a huge win since most traditional places will only have the menu available on weekends for brunch but they know what the people want here. It isn't cheap or low quality food either. The shumai comes out steaming juicy and every bite is a good morsal of shrimp/pork. The soup dumplings also come out piping hot with an explosion of flavor bewteen the soup and meat. I'm a huge fan of the flat nood as well it has a delectble oil taste and that slightly charred falvor that is a hallmark of that dish. The rest of the menu is your tyipcal fare of what you'd get at a good chinese restuarnat and will have something for everyone. Whether you're the most basic of b's getting sesame chicken or a well seasoned connoiseur looking for some authentic chicken feet you'll find something for your palate here.\n\nI'm quite happy to see that Manahattan has got such a solid dim sum game. Everyone raves to me about flushing and how Chinatown sucks (which it does to some degree) but I think this is a solid cornerstone for the city to have and very convenient for any weary business traveler looking for a savory dinner. If dim sum is your jam this is your place." u'Their fried lobster (fried with egg and black bean) is supreme! The lobster is so fresh and the taste of egg and black bean is soaked into the meat and the crust! I had it once with my mom and then I had my birthday dinner here with some friends. LOVE IT!!!' u'Excellent Dim Sum in Midtown!\n\nMy wife and are in NY frequently but rarely stay close to Chinatown. We have found it hard to find accessible dim sum on previous trips...but no more. This is some of the best we have had anywhere. The food was great the service was timely and the prices are very reasonable. We look forward to returning to satisfy our cravings when we are Manhattan.' u'This place looks like it was new but it was still really amazing. Big tables hidden in the back and great service. Food was amazing and there is nothing to complain about. I would definitely come back. WORTH IT!' u"It was fine. I've had better and I've had worse. Probably won't return but if you're in to dim sum it's a decent option." u'So I was in the mood for some warm soupy food and I was yelling and saw this place and decided to try it out. I had never tried hot and sour soup before in my life. So I decided to try it out. Omg what have I been missing out all my life!? Their soup was soooo good! I ordered  seconds. I also got their chicken and pork dim sum. It was very flavorful. I could have had 2 whole dishes of that too. I also got their sesame ball which was a pleasant surprise. Not a huge fan of the inside filling. But I loved the crunchy outside. The only thing I would probably add is maybe have some sort of spicy sauce coz their spicy sauce was not spicy at all.' u"The Crispy Milk is sooo good! the dipping sauce complemented very well to the taste! love the creativity! the dimsum here esp the xiao long bao is way much better than Joe's Shanghai. But most of all the service is really good! we went here today for lunch at around 12:30pm and they were so nice and attentive to our needs! hoe they'll keep this up!" u'This place was great to stop in and get a quick fix of dim sum! I like how they have a mixed basket for single diners and it was very good! I also had the sticky rice in lotus leaf which I always love. Overall I had a very good experience! TIP!!!! Between 3-5 dim sum is half off!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
179.Amélie,[u"This establishment has never ever failed to impress me. I've been coming here with my boyfriend for a couple years and have never had a single negative thing to say. My last birthday we went to dinner to celebrate and I received the best food and the best service I've ever experienced in my entire life. Everyone who works there is so kind and genuinely seem like they want to be there and serve you. They make you feel comfortable and welcome and like family. The food is exquisite. We get the escargot the cheese and charcuterie plate and the grilled octopus every time and are always beyond satisfied. Last night we also ordered the steak-frites medium rare and it was heavenly. It melted in your mouth and the gravy was delicious and the shoestring fries were even incredible. \n\nThey knew it was my birthday and came out with one little candle on a plate after they brought out dessert (to-die-for creme br\xfbl\xe9e with banana on top) and I cried because of how amazing everyone and everything is.\n\nIf you're questioning whether or not you should come here stop and make a reservation. You won't regret a single thing. \n\nThank you Amelie and all of the staff for always making us feel at home. You are officially our favorite restaurant on the planet of earth." u'My good friends were in town so I knew I had to take them somewhere awesome. \n\nAmelie was classy tasty and shockingly affordable. We ordered some of the Amelie favorites and they were all on point. Special shoutout to the Goat Cheese Ball...that thing was heavenly small but heavenly. It was goat cheese and the base was these caramelized onions that were soaked in red wine unusual yea delicious yea.\n\nI bumped it down to 4 because customer service was ok.' u"Cute little happy hour spot where you can enjoy sipping on different types of wine for a reasonable price. \n\nThis dimly lit French restaurant offers a great happy hour where you can indulge in the delicacies of Europe. \n\nHad the pleasure of stopping here with a friend for Happy Hour before heading out to the Halloween Parade. A perfect location to hangout by the way. \n\nI tried the Anthony from the Wine Flights list. All of them were good except the 2nd drink Viognier North which I thought smelled like feet. \n\nThe assorted Crostini's were delicious. A different flavor for each one and the oysters are always a good call with wine." u"All around a phenomenal experience. The waiting and hosting staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive the atmosphere was lively yet intimate and the food was fantastic. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had been looking forward to trying this place out for a few weeks and the expectations were fairly high. All expectations were exceeded and I can't recommend a better place to take a date and try some French food. \n\nThe wine flights were fun the escargot in garlic butter was great the Camembert cheese dip was incredible and deceivingly filling and the banana creme br\xfbl\xe9e was absolutely fantastic especially for people who aren't into overly sweet desserts like myself. \n\nThe whole experience was a 10/10. Cheers!" u"Came here during happy hour on Wednesday evening at 6PM and there were plenty of seats. The first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable the chairs and tables were. It was cramped with minimal space. We ordered 3 flights and 3 plates of food which couldn't fit the small table and made it a disaster to eat/drink. The service however was impeccable. Empty wine glasses were collected right away our waters were always full everything was quick and the servers are super attractive with their French accents!\n\nFor food we ordered:\nWarm Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Ball - Very good but it was literally the size of a pin-pong ball. I could've easily devoured the whole thing by myself. I didn't notice the pistachio but the onion marmalade was a stand out. I wish their bread wasn't so thick so that I could've enjoyed the cheese more. \nRosette de Lyon - This was okay. Their charcuterie has gotten more expensive last I checked. \nHudson Valley Duck Leg Confit - This was good but I've had better at other French restaurants. The mushrooms and potatoes paired nicely. The duck was tender but the only let down is the soggy skin... as I expected a crispy one. \n\nThe bill was close to $100 for 2 people and we were both still hungry unfortunately. The food overall was okay. The real reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because their wine is DELICIOUS! The selections are so perfect. I tried a little bit of everything from pinot noirs to malbec and whites. I loved every single one of them. If I ever return it would just be for the wine." u"I absolutely loved the WINE selection here. They have wine flights for $12 ($16 after 7pm) that include 3 pre picked wines. I loved that they had categorized the wines into spicy reds full smooth reds pinot noir dry oaky reds sweet whites dry mineral whites full whites and roses. I wanted to try all of them! I ended up picking the spicy reds. They also have an extensive wine list in addition to the wine flights. And you can make your own wine flights if you wanted to try other wines.\n\nI came here on a Sunday night without a reservation and was able to get a seat at the bar. It seemed like a reservation wasn't absolutely necessary but maybe I was lucky.\n\nFor FOOD I ordered the tuna tartare and brussels sprouts. Both were delicious and very well done. \n\nService was average not particularly warm or friendly. But my server did continue to refill my (super tiny) glass of water." u"Great lunch with charming service. \nWe each had something different and every one liked their dish.\n\nI had a grilled chicken sandwich which came on lightly toasted ciabatta bread with lettuce and tomatoes and slices of avocado as well as gruyere. I opted for no mayo. Didn't need a thing with the creamy avocado. Came with a side salad if mixed greens.\n\nHusband had their burger -- perfectly cooked as ordered -- it came with those famous crispy thin fries (served with mussels). Yum. \n\nMy friend had a cheese and ham and mushroom omelet. Came with chunky potatoes. She ate every bite!\n\nFor dessert we shared an apple tarte served slightly warmed with fresh strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream along side. Not too sweet so we felt we were eating healthy!  Yum. \n\nShhh. Don't tell anyone about this place. We will be back..." u"An absolutely amazing night out! My boyfriend and I came here for a romantic date night and it was perfect! \n\nI made a reservation ahead of time and I highly recommend doing so. It was packed when we got there around 6 and by the time we left people were being quoted a 45 min wait. \n\nWe got the sweet white wine flight to share and it was perfect the Riesling was definitely my favorite! Also we were there during the happy hour and a flight is only $12 and you get nice full pours. We decided to split a bunch of the small plates. We got the escargot the camembert cheese and the platter of all the crostinis. \n\nThis was our first time trying escargot and we loved them. The green sauce they are served in was absolutely delicious. They serve unlimited baskets of bread with the meal and it's perfect for dipping in the left over sauce. The camembert cheese was served with garlic and honey hot and gooey and perfect with the bread. The crostinis were alright next time we'll probably just pick the ones we liked. The smoked salmon red peppers and onions and the mango ones were the best. \n\nFor dessert we split a creme brulee and it was definitely one of the best I've ever had. They layer bananas on top before making the crust and it's a really nice touch. My boyfriend whose not a big fan of desserts really liked this too!\n\nOverall an absolutely awesome night with amazing food and drinks!! Make a reservation ( you can do it right through yelp) and go get some wine and great food!!" u"Cute French and wine spot for date night in the west village! Great wine and food happy hour!!\n\nGenerous wine pours for the wine flight which exceeded my expectations. Three wines come with a flight! A mix of red and white that's imported and pairs well with the food happy hour!\n\nBook a reservation through Yelp because it does get packed and I went on a Thursday during happy hour! \n\nP.S. I love the escargot although it was not in shells like the one I had in Paris but it was still delicious! I constantly dipped the bread that was given on the side with the escargot sauce! So delicious! \n\nI will need to go back and try the dinner." u'Cute place. Lights hanging there looked like Pok\xe9mon balls. Not too many vegetarian options here except salads. I ordered a french toast which I enjoyed eating. It was just right not overly sweet. Waiters were sweet and prompt w their service. I had great laughs here w my fun friends Lisnel and Amit.' u"Very busy and buzzy atmosphere. The food is just ok with the appetizers being better than the entrees. The chicken liver mousse pork chop and beet salad were good. Don't get the octopus duck or Brussels sprouts. The escargot and whole fish were edible but not much more can be said. And it's a wine bar but just a touristy wine bar not the kind that actually has interesting wines nor cares too much about wine.\n\nIf you must come get the meat and cheese plate at least it will come with the crusty bread." u'The food is solid but the service absolutely abysmal!\nWe had a reserved table for a party of 6 and our server was basically non-existent the entire time. We had to physically walk up to the counter to ask for bread water and butter.  Plus they served our food in a semi-reverse order so that we did not get our appetizers until we were finished with our entrees.  The dishes themselves are solid and I highly recommend the duck confit coq au vin and grilled octopus.  The ratatouille is pretty meh as is the steak which was on the tough side.  Prices are reasonable but be forewarned that portions are very small.  The space is also very cramped but lively.\n\nJust be prepared to wait for your food and chase down your server for very basic service.' u"If you love wine or want to try a bunch of different wines at a relatively reasonable price then I highly recommend you make your way to Amelie.\n\nThis place is perfect for date night girls night or perfect for anyone looking for a quick drink. I highly suggest making a reservation as this place gets packed easily. There's plenty of seats at the bar and high top tables alongside the bar. For something more cozy and relaxed there's plenty of tables towards the back (Make a reservation!!)\n\nMy friend and I shared all of their crostini's which were delicious BTW. Sadly I wasn't too happy with their steak tartare. Presentation was beautiful but it was a little too sweet for my taste. \n\nOverall I would definitely return and would definitely recommend this place. CHECK this place OUT if you're in the West Village. You'll thank me later..." u'A great happy hour spot for wine flights and cheese. The bread is pre-cut and served with the best pear jam and honey. You can easily make a reservation with Yelp' u"I've wondered about amelie for awhile now and had the opportunity to visit tonight. It's no wonder it's rated so highly so frequently on Yelp-\n\nCozy inviting and warm while being traversed minutely- A is ran like a well oiled machine. Clearly the establishment knows what they are doing from the wine and spirits to the food staff ambience down to the smart and necessary way they keep their latrines fresh and pretty with uber potent floral scents. \n\nWe sampled their cab/Bordeaux flight and Pinot noir special. Some were better than others- the cab franc and Spanish Pinot- but to each their own... for $12 per flight HH special one cannot possibly go wrong. \n\nThe escargot smelled and tasted delicious (obvious house favorite) was ample supple snail bites buried in a mountain of saut\xe9ed garlic caramelized onions parsley herbs de Provence topped off with olive oil. It was divine and a generous dish but somehow but still proved hard to share. It was butter herbs for the soul so to speak.\n\nTheir bread in little burlap bags were dusty softened and crusty chewy French bread that I would've happily ate alone but paired perfectly with a decadent goat cheese that was strong with sweet animal scent and a beautiful Camembert that was so mild the nuances of blue cheese only came through at the end. I could've had the bread alone or just noshed on the cheese alone and would've been the happiest camper. But I have a feeling every guest in the house felt the exact same way. Filmy soppressata crunchy sweet grapes and cornichons with honey jam fig mustard seeds rounded out the plate. \n\nTheir food is exceptional. Their drink selection was voluminous and we'd barely broken the ice. Their presentation was thought-provoking and showed obvious   care. \n\nSome restaurants are good because of concept collective effort and continual reinvention and contemplation. Clearly Amelie has all of that and is more than just a cut above- it's one that would require serious stitches." u"J'adore Am\xe9lie\n\nThis is one of my favorite places in the city for a glass (read: flight) of wine after a long day or a quiet Sunday afternoon. This place exemplifies what any brasserie should be; multi purposed. You can come here on a date (and you should) with a group of friends or even by yourself and have a wonderful time reading at the bar. The exceptionally nice guys who run this place all speak in French to one another (and you if you speak to them in French); as such you may find yourself forgetting you're sitting in the village. Our go to for normal visits is sitting at the bar and ordering a board of cheese; three types for 18$ comes with fruits nuts honey apricot jam and of course bread. The bread is worth mentioning as it spectacular (as any decent french restaurant should be). on a Sunday we go for brunch; the brunch menu is small but comprehensive and best of all pretty affordable (hungover me got a burger once it was not only delicious but huge...and only 12$). If you're looking for a romantic spot book a table (its always busy so be sure to do this) and sit in the back. There is no way you're going to lose if you come here if you haven't been be sure to check it out soon. \n\nMerci mes amies pour les vin et le fromage magnifique avec pain. Mais plus importantement merci pour me faisant penser que je suis en France." u"Move over beer flights! Wine flights are what you should be drinking! \n\nWOW. Am\xe9lie is just AMAZING. I used yelp to make a happy hour reservation for myself and a friend. I'm glad I did because at 6:30 the place was packed (happy hour is 4-7). \n\nOf course we ordered the wine flights. There are some selections to help you decide which wines to try based on the type. The waiters are very helpful in that aspect as well. All 3 wines I ordered were amazing! \n\nThe happy hour menu includes pistachio-crusted warm goat cheese on a bed of caramelized onions and honey. Of course the cheeses are served with bread and as soon as I tried it I was in love. The flavors are so unique and they work so well together. \n\nWe also tried the liver p\xe2t\xe9 from the HH menu. I had never tried it before but I actually enjoyed it here. I have nothing else to compare to but with all the sides I tried it with I would actually say the p\xe2t\xe9 was delicious. \n\nThe Camembert which was among the extensive cheese list from the regular menu was also great. Perfect with the wine! It also came with some honey grapes and dried fruit. Loved it!\n\nAAAAND last but not least the ravioli. I thought they would be big Italian style ravioli but they were cute dime-sized pieces of pasta. Covered in a creamy cheese sauce and topped with truffle shavings (+$3) I'd have to say this was tied for my favorite dish (along with the goat cheese). The truffle shavings really made it. \n\nOverall this was just a great experience. The best HH ever especially if you enjoy your wine. I cannot wait to be back here. \n\nAs a side note I've read some reviews about the service being slow so I paid attention to that when I ate here. I actually loved the service. Rather than being slow I thought the servers were just letting the guests enjoy their meals without rushing them. We were still checked up in multiple times and our water glasses were always full. Excellent friendly service!" u'The ambiance is lovely as is the staff. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. \n\nMy friend and I let the waiter chose a 3 piece charcuterie platter. \n\nIt was delicious and had a nice array of sides. The portions were a bit smaller than I prefer but it is NYC. I believe the 3 piece platter is $18. \n\nThey also have lovely wine flights. My friend and I opted for a red wine flight and enjoyed it.' u"Went with a friend who helped write this review. We agreed it's a good spot to catch up with a close friend or a good date spot. Cheese ball was delicious. Loved the combo of the rich cheese with the sweetness of the caramelized onions and the acid from the wine they were reduced in. Flatbread was good but didn't stand out. Trout was awesome - perfectly cooked melted in your mouth. Sauce was bright and acidic. Wine flight was a great deal pretty good wines for the price" u'Ahhhh! Super nice servers and amazing food. \n\nVisiting from SF and happy we came here -\n\nFood: mussels steak tartare and sack of bread were all super delicious. \n\nDrinks: sauvignon blanc + Russian hill paired well with our dishes!'],0.3382,0.21,0.79,0.0
149.Poké Inn,[u"A couple summers ago my friend and I interned in NYC and fell in love with pok\xe9. After that he found a job in SF and I stayed in the city. So when he finally visited he really craved pok\xe9. That's how we came across this place. \n\nOriginally this place only had maybe 10-20 reviews on Yelp but all were glowing. As a result we took the risk and came down to try it out. Luckily we were very impressed.\n\nThe storefront itself is very modest and tucked near a courtyard or plaza so it's really easy to pass by unless you're looking out for it. We went in and I ordered the Rainbow Love while my friend made his own. We were surprised to see that the prices were $11 for a medium or $14 for a large since a lot of areas around Midtown East (where I work) will charge around $13 as a base price. \n\nWhile there was minimal seating inside luckily that courtyard had seating for nicer days. When we finally got to eat it everything was amazing. The quality of the ingredients was definitely up there the ingredients complemented each other and accompanying sauces and the portion was definitely adequate. If you want a no-frills high-quality pok\xe9 place definitely stop by here" u"Stopped by earlier this morning for a bowl. The shop is bare bones but it's not without charm; it looks out onto a nice sunny plaza with lots of outdoor seating.\n\nThe protein offerings are typical although they do have a barbecue eel option. The sauces and toppings are fairly standard as well from edamame to mango to seaweed. Not the widest selection I've seen but nothing lacking.\n\nI made my own brown rice bowl with salmon and eel to go topped with double mountains of seaweed salad and crab salad. It held up well for my couple-block walk with the salmon not cooking too much despite the warm rice. Portions on everything were good though I think they could use a touch more sauce. Salmon was fresh and eel was great.\n\nThe small bowl is ~$12 with tax which seems fair given its size. I also took advantage of the free drink offer on Yelp so now I have a Calpico for later. Staff was friendly but had some slight communication issues. No line at 11:45ish.\n\nOverall recommended if you're in the market for poke near Times Square." u"Eel!!! BBQ eel!! So good. Such a treat to have. The tuna was good not amazing but solid. \n\nToppings were great. My favorite are the sweet shiitake mushrooms. Jalape\xf1os crunchy onions and the standards like scallions edamame crab and seaweed salad. \n\nSauces: ponzu and spicy aioli made a good mix. \n\nPrice: $11.90. Reasonable since it was a good portion. \n\nService: fast efficient. Not much seating space inside but there's a lovely and huge outdoor seating area steps away. \n\nI'd definitely come back!" u"I've ordered from Poke Inn via Seamless a couple of times and I've been impressed!\nThe options are great fish is fresh and the price is right. I've also tried their shumai which I really enjoyed!" u"Probably one of the best poke places I've had in NYC. I came in on a cold day and the shop was warm but not stuffy nor too warm. I started my order with half rice half salad then tuna and salmon. The tuna and salmon were put in a separate mixing bowl and I had garlic sauce and sesame oil added to it as well as mango jalape\xf1o cucumber and kale. It was all mixed together with the sauce and put on top of my bed of rice and greens. Then I topped that off with seaweed salad crabmeat mushrooms dried seaweed strips and fried onion. It was a very satisfactory bowl of food. The seaweed was a bit too marinated but everything else was great. Rice was a bit clumped together but for the most part everything else was fresh. Great prices for the amount of food you get in NYC - it was $11.90. I hope this place doesn't change; I'm probably going to make it my go-to poke place!" u"The pok\xe9 craze continues and this place is a good option. The price is pretty affordable and even with a regular size you get a lot of food. In addition to make-your-own they offer some popular combinations available as well. The fish are fresh and they offer a good variety of veggies to go with the poke. \n\nIf the weather is nice you can take your bowl and eat outside. A nice open space with a lot of tables and chairs is available. Plus free beverage when you check in! The staff are super nice and friendly. I'll definitely back." u"There are so many poke places now. I liked \n Poke Inn because it wasn't too fancy but you knew you were getting good food. \n\nI had a make your own with sushi rice salmon unagi masago seaweed edamame and...lots of other toppings with wasabi mayo sauce. Also crab meat topping at no extra cost! Rice definitely makes it filling. There were large chunks of salmon which I always appreciate. The price was comparable to most other Poke places but definitely more fish than other places. Would come again for lunch. There is hardly any seating but it's at new world stages so always a courtyard to sit at" u"My stomach was crying for food as I stumbled into this restaurant. I usually like to create my own bowls but there was no time to be wasted. The hunger demanded I just choose a signature bowl and get food ASAP. I decided to go for the rainbow love; it has tuna and salmon win win! The service was quick and I received my meal before I knew it. I sat inside; the place is small and there were only about 9 seats total. Also Don't forget to check in after you order. I used that to get a complimentary miso soup- which was surprisingly larger than I expected. I left there full and satisfied and with leftovers. I'm happy!" u"I had high expectations given the reviews I read for Poke Inn. Unfortunately it just failed to deliver. I ordered a poke salad bowl with eel and tofu as my meats. The eel had a very strange texture almost rubbery and the tofu was a little sour- I ended up picking them out and not eating it. I also made the order online and added in the notes comment for dressing on the side as I was going to have to do a little commute before I could actually sit and eat it and didn't want all the ingredients to get soggy. Unfortunately that request was ignored and the ingredients were pretty soggy when I did eat it. The things I liked about it was that there is an abundance of ingredients and they're all fresh. This is the first poke restaurant I've been to that sells eel which was very cool. They don't skimp on the ingredients either even the more pricey ones like the grab meat or seaweed salad. You have to pay extra for avocado but I think that's pretty standard in poke stores. The cost was also pretty reasonable. I think I paid 11.90$ at checkout." u"I've made it my mission to try as many poke places in NY as possible and this is a new place - just opened recently. The store is clean and the staff is friendly and attentive. \n\nThings that stood out: \nThey have eel! And it was very good. \nAll of the toppings are free except avocado of course\n\nMeh:\nThe tuna didn't seem as fresh as other poke places. Some pieces were great and some were not...perhaps their fish was frozen at some point? I am not sure. It wasn't bad by any means - just something I noticed.\n\nOverall I would recommend. This is in a little area with plenty of outdoor seats too.\n\nPrice point - $11.90" u'Pretty good food considering the look of this place. It looks like a really bad location in a beautiful place. The bowl was very fresh. We then sat outside in the courtyard of the apartment building. Very nice and wonderful sitting outside and watching all of the happenings of the courtyard. \n\nBottom line: enjoy this delicious food just ignore the rough looking exterior. LOL.' u"It feels like every few weeks a new poke place opens in Midtown  and it's impossible to keep up! One of the recent additions to the poke scene is Poke Inn and it's one of the better ones. Like most of the poke spots in the city they have pre-designed or build your own options and here you can get your poke in a bowl a salad or a burrito.\n\nThe regular size includes two proteins for $10.95 and the options here are a little more varied than some other spots. They have three types of tuna (albacore ahi and spicy tuna) and BBQ eel as well as more common options like salmon chicken and shrimp. You can add in a sauce and unlimited mix-ins and toppings with only avocado being an extra charge which is nice. \n\nEverything in the bowl was really fresh and the quality of ingredients was good. Staff was very friendly and patient. Not a lot of seating inside but the plaza outside has plenty of tables so not really an issue. Will definitely be back for more poke." u"Probably 3-3.5 stars. The fish is pretty poor quality - you can certainly taste the difference between the fish here and the fish from Pok\xe9works. However all of the other ingredients were great and it was a pretty healthy portion so I might actually come again. Overall pretty average and fine if you are craving poke and happen to be in the area! (And don't feel like walking 10-15 blocks south to Pok\xe9works)" u"Came here after seeing the positive reviews on Yelp and I was a bit disappointed. \n\nPlace is a bit small and doesn't have a lot of seats. It was a bit empty when I went but I was glad I could take my time with my order. \n\nFirst you start off with a base. Then proteins. \nI got a brown rice bowl with eel and tuna. The brown rice was a bit hard to chew. It took a lot of effort to eat the rice. The eel was something new. It was well marinated and tasted fine without mixing any sauce into it. The tuna wasn't as fresh and didn't taste as great.\n\nThe next step was mix ins but I was asked what sauce I wanted. I was a bit confused what if I wanted sauce with my mix ins?\nFor mix ins I got mango onions kale and it added a nice sweetness to my bowl. \n\nI got a Yelp checkin offer for a free drink. They don't have a fridge outside so I was a bit confused on what drinks they had. The worker pointed to a handwritten sign that was a bit hard to read. \nPortions are a bit small for the price." u'Delicious! My first time trying Poke was here...easy to understand menu and helpful friendly staff made ordering a cinch! Fresh tasty tuna on a salad mix with lots of fresh veggies and some crispy things made for a diverse texture. The only thing is that there was a hair in my bowl :-( I removed it and continued eating as I know this can happen anywhere just put your hair up!' u'My daughter and I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. A tiny hole in the wall on a nice courtyard. The Poke was awesome fresh tasty and I wish we could go back every week. Thanks!' u'Here with my husband ordered the poke bowl very delicious and inexpensive the location is very good and very friendly staffs' u'I\'m new to the Pok\xe9 world and after my experience at Pok\xe9 Inn I can see what all the hype is about. Pok\xe9 Inn offered a handful of fresh and healthy toppings and were very generous with the portions. I ordered the Pok\xe9 Bowl "Your Way" and was impressed by all of the toppings available to choose from including fresh mango seaweed salad kale etc. The shop is small with only about 6 seats but there is plenty of outdoor seating in the courtyard. A great place to stop for a quick and healthy meal.' u"So yummy. The poke is filling fresh and reasonably priced. My gf and I went after 5:30. The service is quick and they make sure they got it right. I got the eel salmon and tuna with the wasabi aioli over sushi rice. Very good portions. There was plenty of flavor but if you're looking for a nice kick in the nose the wasabi wasn't strong at all. I guess they don't want to burn anyone's throats. \n\nWe both got crab meat as a topping for our bowls for no extra charge. They did charge for avocado though. But that's the new normal. \n\nDefinitely will come back again. Looking forward to try it as a burrito." u"I'm always looking for new pok\xe9 spots near my workplace and this was an unexpectedly great find! I got a rice bowl with salmon and shrimp and picked the spicy aioli which is delicious with a bit of ponzu. They also added in a splash of sesame oil! Portions are large too -- I was absolutely stuffed.\n\nI'm a huge pok\xe9 fan who has been very loyal to Pok\xe9works but this place might be my new go-to spot. Definitely do the check-in to claim a free drink. Large bowl a drink and fantastic seating outside in the summer. I will be coming back!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
3.Junior’s Cheesecake,[u"Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I was elated when my friend ordered one to be shipped ... all the way to Baltimore! I didn't think shipping cheesecake was a thing but apparently it is and it was well worth the two day delivery. \n\nThe cheesecake came frozen (which means I had to wait for it to defrost boo) but it was delicious the next day. \n\nI'm used to cheesecake having a thick graham cracker crust so I was a little sad mine didn't have that but it's okay. Overall good cake and I can't wait until I have the opportunity to go visit the actual restaurant in person." u'I loved my time this evening at JR\'s. I mean the food was great the bartender Sergio was / is the best. He\'s welcoming engaging and good at what he does. The burgers we had topped with Pastrami were done perfectly medium rare just like we asked.. the best fries.. everything was going smooth until I heard one co worker waiter harass and intimidate a female co worker. \n\nLook I come to a restaurant to eat I pay for food drink and should not spend 60 dollars to listen to some young kid waiter berate a co worker over her choice of clothing designer and then shit all over the President of the United States. \n\nJust like taking a knee the resist movement the NYC sit in movement and the pure stupidity of working for tips AND not knowing your audience just makes me want to vomit. Not from the food but the ignorance in people that work in the food service industry and specifically what I witnessed the harassment of a female co worker. \n\nI will NEVER eat in this location or visit a JR\'s again ever! I approached the female coworker (who I\'ve had as a waitress in the past) and assured her that her taste in designer was good and that there were no "slaves used to produce her clothing". I do believe one other employee heard what was going on and told the accosting employee to knock it off.. not sure! \n\nSergio is still the best at the bar.. he should find a job where people appreciate their employees.' u'This is a fun experience that everyone should have when they visit NYC.  If you happen to be in NYC and want to do the whole tourist thing Juniors is a staple.  The food for a meal is pretty good and the cheesecake is delicious....huge portions and you get the whole NYC vibe from the wait staff and (mostly tourist) customers.\n\nIts a fun experience and I suggest checking it out if you have not been.\n\nMake sure you come hungry portions are huge!!  And do not leave without dessert!  I recommend cheesecake but the ice cream is pretty delicious as well!' u"Junior's Cheesecake is by far one of the top cheesecakes I have ever tasted! I'm only focusing on the cheesecake on this review. We ordered the red velvet and devils food cheesecakes. Both were creamy soft smooth and moist! Red velvet anything is my absolute favorite so it was a must that we ordered it. Devils food was super chocolatey and it reminded me of a slice of chocolate cake. The slices were huge! It was more than enough to share and both had the perfect amount of cake layers and cheesecake in the middle. The service was quick and there wasn't a long wait for a table considering its location near Times Square. This place was fun and lively and there were so many birthdays that evening which means cheesecakes galore that came out every ten minutes! \n\nI will order a box to go during my next visit to New York. I regret it now that I didn't!" u'Let\'s start with the 11:03am arrival this morning which apparently on Sunday is too late for their breakfast menu which "cuts off at 10:45am".\n\nWTF?!?\n\n10:45am on a Sunday is too late to order breakfast?!?\n\nAbsurd.\n\nBe that as it may for some reason this tourist trap was bookmarked on my Yelp and I was close by enough this morning to stop by.\n\nMy waitress was great - so no complaints here.\n\nNow about the food ...\n\nOrdered the Reuben with a side of steak fries. Both were solid albeit not remarkable.\n\nAlso ordered the French onion soup and a side of potato pancake.\n\nThe French onion soup lacked flavor and desperately needed some salt. The cheese to bread to onion to broth ratios were otherwise okay and texturally okay too.\n\nThe potato pancake was a huge disappointment. A waste of carbs. See the caption to my photo if further interested.\n\nAhhhh - other than the really good waitress - the saving grace was the plain cheesecake which lives up to all the hype (and is probably the sole reason I had this place bookmarked).\n\nWill I return for another meal ... NO.\n\nWould I get cheesecake to-go when I\'m the neighborhood ... sure.' u"[495]\n\nThis review is for breakfast.\n\nThe restaurant is right across the street from our Hotel so we decided to give it a try for breakfast.   \n\nThe place is nicely decorated which includes a bunch of outside tables which are perfect for people watching.\n\nOur waitress Angela was really nice and had conversations with my 8 year old.  \n\nHubby had the lumberjack special which he enjoyed $20\n\nKid had two scrambled eggs (that's it) for $10 which he did not eat.  There were brown grill marks so he didn't want to eat it.  I suspect they didn't properly clean the grill area.\n\nI had the veggie omelet $15 which was eh.  My large omelet was bland and I didn't enjoy the potatoes.  They were not fresh ... if they were they were too perfect/squares and the whole wheat bread was cold and no jelly was offered.\n\nI won't be back for breakfast." u"I was told Junior's is the best cheesecake in the world. My thoughts? It's definitely in the top 3 cheesecakes I've ever tried! Super soft creamy and rich. Not overwhelming in terms of sweetness and a pretty big slice. I tried the blueberry and think it's much better to get one of the fruit flavors to add some additional flavors and textures. The blueberry had some crumble on top with added a nice crunch to contrast the heavenly cheesecake. \n\nService is fast and friendly. My only complaint is that it's really expensive. About $8 for one slice which could get you a full $8 cheap cheesecake. SO FORGET ABOUT MONEY AND ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE. IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS!!\n\nFood: 5/5\nValue: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nOverall: 4.75/5" u"Ughh. Tourist trap! I ONLY ate here because I was being a team player. Yelp certainly had better options. It's American fare so the menu items will be familiar and hard to mess up right!??\n\nIt's probably my fault  while I thought I ordered off the menu... I MUST have asked for the driest most flavorless chicken known to man. And boy did they deliver. I won't even mention the time it took to bring our beverages. The waiter was nice but I was there for physical nourishment. I left hungry.\n\nPerhaps the cheesecake is the reason to visit Junior's. I wasnt in the mood for dessert; I still needed to eat lunch. The burgers might have been a better choice perhaps. Fries were good. \n\nMy last bit of advise save yourself by eating inside. Beside the grainy Times Square dust that tip toes in the breeze  I had to close the door to my nostrils when the waiters changed the trash. We weren't near the trash can but whatever meat was rotting in the bag shot its pheromones in the air.   *blaa* This was not the experience I'd hope for. Next time the team picks something basic I'll look to Yelp to find me a unicorn.  I knew better...its my fault." u"Three Thousand Plus Reviews and earning Four Plus Stars in New York foodie capital of the world.. What can possibly be left to say?\n\nWe go for the traditional Pastrami on Rye ($14.95) maybe with mozzarella cheese maybe not but always with mustard and pickles. Delicious!\n\nJunior's Five Stars." u"Came here for brunch on a Thursday morning at 8 am for a party if 6 and no wait! Located right in the center of Times Square it's a easy location to bring all your visiting friends for food and dessert. We weren't seated until everyone had arrived. \n\nThe prices were steep (expected for midtown) but there was a lot more food than expected so it wasn't actually that bad! I got the pastrami omelette with grits to share and it came with 4 half slices of toast and butter. The omelette was well seasoned and a pretty good portion between two people. My friends got the breakfast potatoes and those looked amazing... \n\nWe didn't get the cheesecake here but at another location highly recommended! All together a great place to take and visitors (or to go yourself) in a convenient location. my only qualms were that the waiter seemed a little annoyed when our entire table only wanted water and a couple of us we're splitting portions. I understand they are running a business but it still made me uncomfortable." u"When I asked if it was better than Eileen's they asked me who she was sad. I would say it's expensive but worth it if you are craving cheesecake around Times Square. Otherwise go somewhere else that's much less touristy. \nReally good though." u"It's the best cheese cake in NYC.  They had one at Grand Central Station but it closed not sure way.  Use to stop there every time I came into the city.  My daughter and her friends shared a slice and really enjoyed it" u"This review is just for the cheesecake!  I came here after dinner and walking around Times Square. So yes it's a good dessert  after all that walking and excitement.  I tried the raspberry cheesecake and it was just perfect not too sweet with a hint of tangy taste.  Must try!" u"I absolutely love Junior's cheesecake. I was very lucky to go to school which was a few blocks away from Junior's original location in Brooklyn. And I was glad that there was another restaurant not too far from my work.\n\nMy go-to cheesecake has always been the original flavor which was tangy creamy smooth and rich with the right amount of sweetness. This is also my last meal on earth. I have also tried the strawberry cheesecake which was as good but a little bit sweeter." u"During our 3 days stay in NY we ate here twice.... had a great lunch the first day and decided to come back for dinner before our Broadway show when we couldn't get the reservation at a fine dining restaurant.\n\nOur lunch experience was very pleasant we were happy to receive the complimentary pickles and beets which we don't normally get in the west coast orders were huge 4 of us we shared two burgers a large salad and cheese cake all delicious. What really impressed us was the super friendly and attentive service provided by our waiter it was exceptional. \n\nThe dinner was yummy too we were in a hurry but managed to finish chicken wings a brisket dinner spaghetti with meat balls a large salad and blueberry cheesecake. Again all the dishes were tasty and in generous portions we went to our show with a happy stomach. \n\nJunior is definitely a great spot for visitors right in the middle of the theater district excellent service wonderful food reasonably priced." u"This place is in the heart of Time Square so it is definitely busy. All the cheesecakes were delicious. Our favorites were the NY (plain) cheesecake and the carrot cake cheesecake. We were really looking forward to trying the tiramisu cheesecake but I can't remember if they ran out or if they said that they only have tiramisu cheesecake available for delivery only. Yes they deliver! We came in pretty late at night so a couple of the cheesecakes we intended to order such as the tiramisu cheesecake and they key lime pie cheesecake were not available. Don't want to dine in? They have a Junior's express next door for all your cheesecake needs.\n\nAccording to some website I visited Junior's has the best cheesecake in New York. Junior's definitely fulfilled that expectation." u'Came here for brunch during our trip to NYC on Labor Day weekend and enjoyed the food service and the ambiance.  \n\nWe all enjoyed some version of a pastrami sandwich.  The meat is so incredibly good.  The sandwich is so large that I could only eat half of it.  AND I CAN EAT!  The side were also very good. The fried were very Crispy.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Burger with pastrami and love it.   The onion rings are also a sight for the eyes.  Homemade and very big.  \n\nWe all got cheesecake to go.  I had the chocolate Mousse cheesecake which was excellent.  \n\nVisit this place!!' u'I was here with my wife right at 6.30am when they opened. The inside looked very nice decorated everything was clean and we also got seated right away. \nMy wife ordered a Cheese omelet with Bacon I got a Pastrami Omelet with sausage. Both dishes were additionally served with potatoes and toast.\nI wish I could say I enjoyed the food but both omelets where too bland. The small potatoes were over cooked and also bland. \nFor the toast I just wished they would have served us a little bit of butter. \nThe service was fast and nice though so I will give 3 stars' u"Try finding a better sit-down restaurant around midnight and you'd be stumped! My boyfriend and I had just gotten drinks at one of the rooftop bars close-by and were bummed that they didn't serve food. Well the boyfriend was sad about this and I'm perpetually hungry so naturally we went wandering for food. This place was so lively and packed so there was no doubt they were open. Prices can be a little on the higher end since it's in Times Square/Broadway but the food and service are on point. \n\nI ordered the turkey swiss burger and the boyfriend got the steakburger - both delicious and could definitely tell these weren't your typical fast food/diner burgers. His came with sauteed onions that really amped up the flavor and were absolutely perfect but the onion rings on the plate next to it were god awful. I would compare them to funnel cakes because of how thick the breading was. If I were coming here after bar hopping and ate something that greasy/bready I would probably throw up. Buuuuut there were only one or two onion rings anwyay so it's not a huge deal." u"I came for the cheesecake but stayed for the Reuben. And also the cheesecake. Which is phenomenal by the way. Not like your usual phenomenal which could be used to describe a NYC street performance. Rather it is that kind of phenomenal where your voice tapers off towards the end of uttering the word because the breath has literally been sucked from your mouth in an effort to meet the demand of an increased saliva production which was triggered as soon as you laid eyes on what may be the greatest cheesecake work of art that you me or anyone else has ever had the supreme good fortune to be a part of witness and enjoy. \n\nBeing from the south cheesecake has always been high on my list. Sometimes even fried because as southerners we believe life is better fried. That's why it's so dang hot down here. Anyway my expectations were set very high for Junior's and much like a treehouse in the middle of a hurricane they were blown away. \n\nMost importantly the food. I already painted a Picasso of the cheesecake. There are many options and I would personally recommend trying the original even though I started with the red velvet cheesecake and even though it was that kind of phenomenal previously described. Reason being is because as Mark Twain once said you cannot break the rules of the English language until you have first mastered the fundamentals. I would like to think he would have/did say the same thing about cheesecake. \nFor the main course I went with the standard Reuben. Piled high and delicious. Unfortunately I did not have time to explore the whole menu personally but the quality of what I did have suggests that everything is to die for. \n\nSome say that the service here is poor. I disagree based on my own experience because my server Adam was delightful. He had a thick Brooklyn accent and was gruff but also polite and attentive. He cracked jokes and made me feel welcomed like that one uncle at most holiday gatherings. \n\nIn summary even if you only came here for cheesecake you would not be disappointed. New York style cheesecake is different and in my opinion superior to all others. Maybe it's the egg cream or maybe it's the love. I love the egg cream so I will say it is both. Check it out and see for yourself."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
117.Burger & Lobster,[u'Five ways to celebrate life love and your inner or "outer" child at Burger and Lobster. \n\nFocus on the food. Perfectly cooked fresh lobster here is worth a weekend circuitous subway trip or sardines-in-a-can traffic car ride to Manhattan. Now there\'s no longer a viable reason to patronize a certain seafood restaurant chain (which shall remain nameless) with hellish wait times and just-ok fare.  \n\nTake your mom here repeatedly and watch the unapologetic criticism in her eyes melt away in the side of garlic butter sauce served with the steamed or grilled whole lobster. I have had it prepared both ways and divine divine divine each and every time. Mom ordered steamed lobster and she became a little girl again--giddy with excitement for the great food they serve in this spacious modern and clean restaurant. Even the side salad was great. I don\'t think I\'ve seen her smile like that since my son was a baby. \n\nSpeaking of my favorite superhero bring your own LO here and order him his own lobster before he makes you give him yours. They don\'t have a kids menu at otherwise kid-friendly Burger and Lobster but if they don\'t finish their lobster and fries poor us for having to eat more delicious lobster. I cracked it open for him secretly hoping he would need my help to finish eating it but honestly he devoured his lobster like a champ!\n\nCome here for your birthday lunch. No matter how grumpy and cynical you are for getting older or how hyped and on top of the world you are for another fabulous birthday nothing will embrace the moment with more zest for life than eating luscious juicy lobster accompanied by a birthday cocktail. I had a gin drink can\'t remember the name of it but the taste and presentation I remember. It was served in an old-school gin martini glass with grapes. So good that I had to have a second one. \n\nEnjoy the consistently good service from hosts and hostesses that seat you at the best possible tables to servers that make good suggestions and really seem to care about doing a good job no matter who it is they\'re serving. My mom and I both agreed that Aaron was the best!! He provided top notch service without bogging us down with too much attention. And he was kind down to earth and understanding. A real people person.\n\nIf only I could live in a restaurant Burger and Lobster would be move-in ready but I\'d be 500 lbs.' u"Food is good service is good.\nManagement didn't really care I lost my wallet in their establishment I have to search it and get info from other customers to find it myself the thief wet my wallet and took the cash but the management have nothing to say about it! Shouldn't they offer me to show the surveillance video in the establishment? I am glad I only kept $300 in the wallet and the rest of the money in my pocket.\nThere are so many lobsters rolls and burgers restaurants in New York why should I go back to the one with bad experiences!" u"Great place to host large parties. They have a large bar downstairs reavers for large groups. They also have carter packages with delicious burgers lobster and fries!\n\nSurprisingly they have a great selection of beers also. If you're in the area stop by for a bite the prices are affordable." u"Loved this place! The boyfriend and I were able to share the burger lobster combo. Great food and fresh! \nDrawback they won't seat you unless your full party is there!" u'Let me start off by saying that I have wanted to go to Burger and Lobster for a while now and we finally decided tonight was the night. \n\nWe came in at a little past 5pm to a relatively empty restaurant which is fine. On first glance the bar looked impressive with dozens of battles all on the wall. The decor was a little strange for a restaurant that seems to cater to a "New Yorker". It basically looks like a diner. \n\nWe go to sit down and our waiter greeted up promptly to tell us about the happy hour prices and the small menu. \n\nAfter he came back with our drinks (I always order sparkling water) but they only have soda water. I thought that\'s was a little bit odd considering. \n\nWe ordered the lobster bites. They are lobster pieces with cheese rolled in puff pastry and with a chili dipping sauce. They were ok. \n\nThen came time for us to order our main course. I ordered the Frenchman and he ordered the Beast. \n\nBoth come with salad and fries. I ordered a side of the truffle creme fresh in addition to our meal. \n\nWhen my plate was placed in front of me I though that they might of had a mix up. Because the burger that was placed in front of me was smaller than a lemon. Yet it cost $33. Um..... \n\nWe should of said something then and there but we kept thinking that there had to be more than what we had by ways of the flavor department. \n\nLong story short: I will not go back to B&L. I honestly do not get what the hype is about this place at all. Such a disappointment.' u'The combo 1 is the best bet.  We were sat downstairs even though there was plenty of seating.  Was not given a choice.   Place gets busy so make sure to make reservations or come earlier.   Food was good and convenient to the area. \n\nIf u want just lobster the 1.5lb is a better deal' u'The perfect combination anyone can imagine you are either a burger lover or lobster lover!  My co-worker is a very picky eater by that I meant he has a very limited variety of food consumption but as for me I like seafood and any exotic food.  So while I was researching for a place where both of us can enjoy dinner this place popped up as the perfect choice!  He can have a nice burger and I can have a nice lobster! \n\nI had the 1.5 lb. lobster boiled with garlic lemon sauce for $28!  Great deal!\n\nNeedless to say we both enjoyed our meal!' u'Took my friend who was visiting from Atlanta here because I personally wanted to try their Lobster Roll.  It is really difficult to get a good (or even decent) lobster roll in Manhattan despite it\'s proximity to Boston and Maine.  However this place seemed to have some amazing reviews of lobster rolls so we decided to try it out.  \n\nThe Original Lobster Roll: Lobster tossed in Japanese mayo with chives\nPROS:\n- fresh not overly dressed\n- good quantity of lobster\n- good ratio of lobster to roll compared to some other places in NYC\nCONS:\n- slightly on the smaller end than what I was used to in Boston\n\nThe Seven Samurai: Lobster meat dressed in ginger infused mayo with cucumbers scal- lions napa cabbage sesame seeds and togarashi sprinkle\nPROS: \n- stuffed like crazy! \n- nice balance of flavor even with all the added things to it\nCONS:\n- could have larger chunks of lobster in there\n\nI honestly don\'t think it was incredibly memorable.  It was good don\'t get me wrong.  And I do like the variations of the lobster roll.  It was actually better than some of the infamous and popular "lobster roll places" in Manhattan but I\'ve definitely had a better roll at another restaurant.  I do like how it is served with a side of greens though at least for me.  It breaks up the heaviness of just having the roll itself.  I\'d still come back again but it just didn\'t slam me with a big "WOW" when it comes to lobster rolls.  It\'d be nice to try their burgers though since this is a lobster AND burger place.  Definitely worth checking out at least once if you\'re on a search for a good lobster roll in New York!' u"Came with family for mom's bday; party of 9. We ordered 3 big boys 2 beast burgers and 2 lobster rolls. The big boys come with unlimited fries and salad... unfortunately even though requested to come first fries and salad didn't come out until everything else came much later on.\n\nHere's my problem; two servers came out with the plates and one shouted BURGER BURGERRR even though we'd indicated who wanted the burgers when ordering. They then just plopped everything down and we were to figure out ourselves. Granted we were eating family style so we shared the lobsters but a little help in making space on the table would've went a long way. Instead I was waved off when I asked the server if he could take away my empty can. At this point I get up to help distribute fries/salad and clear trays to make space. I then go in search of help to take away cleared items. \n\nOur main server came to check on us soon after and a manager after that to attempted to recover the service. The effort is appreciated but am surprised and disappointed at the experience. Maybe that server was having a rough day." u"OMG this place is so freakin amazing! I almost want to move to NYC just so I could eat at this place every single day lol\n\nFirst of all how are they able to offer lobster for $20? And it comes with sides.\n\nI came here expecting a wait at 7pm but surprisingly there were still tables and the bar was pretty much completely open. I came on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar.\n\nI ordered the 1.5 pound steamed (you can also order it grilled) lobster it comes with fries and a salad on the side. You can also choose from drawn butter or garlic lemon butter. \n\nThe lobster was honestly so juicy and cooked perfectly - not dry or rubbery like it is at many places. The claws are my fav part they give you some tools to help you crack the claws and a pick to dig the meat out. \n\nEverything was delicious here and i'll def be coming back the next time I'm in NYC." u"Food: 4/5\nService: 5/5\nCleanliness: 5/5\nDecor & Style: 5/5\n\nI thought the Lobster roll was great not as great as Boston's roll but good enough! It is very expensive though but what Lobster roll isn't? I really like the ambience and decor of this place and a great place to chill with friends for prolonged periods of time. Excellent beer choices on tap!" u'It was great!\nincredible. delicious. \nmodern interior. \ncombo is good enough. good price. \nlobster roll is amazing. \n \nbest burger I ever had.' u'Today my lobster was dry.  I always order the grilled lobster but today was dry.  And I wanted to impress my visiting guest.\n\nIt should be consistently good!' u"Cool idea my two favorite things plus french fries on the menu. Was super pumped. \nAgain burger or lobster. Friend got a burger I got the lobster.\nBoth come with fries and a salad.\nFries were 5/5 crispy hot delicious salty\nSalad was 5/5: small fresh red onion and balsamic\nLobster: they mass produce these giant lobsters and like I read in other reviews mine was overcooked. I really didn't enjoy a single bite. Had to load up on the fries which I wasn't too mad about.\nBurger: Giant delicious but nothing special about it.\n\nIf you want to spend $20 on lobster or lobster roll head down to Ed's lobster. Or Luke's. Not worth the $ here folks." u"Saw a picture of the lobster roll sandwich on someone's feed and said to myself I must eat.  Got to come here on a relaxing Sunday for lunch since I was here for a conference.  I was greeted immediately and all the staff was super friendly.\n\nI sat at the bar knowing I would have quick service.  There was about 5 lobster sandwiches to choose from. I ordered my sandwich and utilized the restroom to wash my hands and as soon as I came out my sandwich was already on the bar.  Now talk about fast service. I chose the seven samurai lobster sandwich which came with a side salad and fries. The roll the sandwich came out was buttery and tasted just like a pretzel. Lobster was a decent portion but nothing phenomenal.  Presentation was classy for the price point." u"This is one of those times where I feel the pictures looked way better than the food tasted. \n\nI came here on my birthday with my hubby for lunch and I got the original lobster 1.5 lb ($28) and he ordered the combo for 1 which includes a 6oz. Burger and a 1lb lobster ($33). Look this place is just burger or lobster so when a place only offers 2 main ingredients it should be fantastic! Right? Wrong. The burger was actually pretty good cooked medium rare as we wanted and flavorful. Their meat is sourced from la Frieda so honestly can't mess up a burger.\n\nThe lobsters were a whole different story. \n\nFirst off my 1.5 lb lobster was mushy which means this little guy was dead before they started cooking him. It's a fact that once lobster dies their meat begins to soften. Don't believe me? Google it.\nSecond the 1lb lobster was tough and chewy. I almost choked eating this guy because after a few minutes of chewing and not being able to break it down anymore I tried to swallow and it almost got stuck in my throat.\nAnd last but not least the 1 lb and 1.5 lb looks about the same size yet the price is a $8 difference. \nOnly good thing about the lobster was the lemon garlic butter that came with it.\n\nOverall a pretty disappointing meal. Thumbs down. Sad emoji." u"Had a really great time here. Would rate it 4.5/5 if I could. \n\nThe rundown: I bought the London with garlic butter sauce. First things first the fries are amongst the best I've ever had. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside it is truly delicious and every cookout parent needs to eat here to understand what it means to make fries. \n\nThe garlic butter is also incredibly delicious and pairs well with the burger and fries. If you like buttery heaven this is the perfect combo for you.\n\nThe burger was surprisingly large and had a lot of juices to it. Very good meat and the faces I was making while munching on this probably gave pause to onlookers. Only thing thing that could be improved would be the bun. \n\nOverall a must eat place in NYC. Environment was good and the food was even more excellent. Would definitely come back!" u'This is the 5th time I have been here... probably even more. Even though it is not the first time but the love is still there. Whenever I am craving for lobster Buger and lobster always pop in my mind.\n\nBasically if you are craving for a plate of meaty simple lobster dish there is no better place than burger and lobster. The other selling point is that their burger is actually not bad! With the price and quality in mind there is no reason to complain especially in the city!\n\nAfter writing this review I feel like I need to go back again tonight lol' u'I had a great time at Burger & Lobster!\n\nI love the space and the decor at this place. It is extremely airy which I liked. The bar is really extravagant and the set up is beautifully unique. They have many many liquors to choose from on this glass bar if you are looking to grab a drink with your meal. Now onto the food!! I ordered the Combo for 1 which is a 5oz burger 1lb lobster fries and a salad. The burger was good and the lobster was even better. What really stole the show though was the lemon garlic butter. Man oh man that butter was to die for. We were pouring that butter on everything and even had to ask for more and they give you quiet a bit to begin with I very much enjoyed my meal. Its a lot of food so I thought for sure that I was going to end up taking some home but I ended up eating it all! I was very satisfied and full but not in an overwhelming way. The service was friendly and speedy. This place is super fun and I definitely will be returning and recommend everyone check this place out!' u'Hands down for this gem! There are only 3 items on the non-existing menu that only cost $20 each with the sides! I came by around 8 on a Sunday and the place was pretty crowded. The hostess estimated a 20-30 mins wait but we were seated right after getting our drinks while waiting by the bar. The four of us ordered a lobster roll and a $60 combo (for 2) which includes 2 burgers 2 halves of a lobster 2 fries 2 salads anddd 2 desserts of your choice! It was so fulfilling and mouthwatering! The burgers were perfectly cooked in medium rare and the fries were great being dipped into the lemon garlic butter sauce! Yuummmmm! We chose strawberry cheesecake mousse and the chocolate gelato for dessert and of course they were delicious as well. So glad that my friend had brought us here definitely coming back for the great food and amazing price!'],0.9544,0.554,0.446,0.0
45.TSQ Food Court,[u"As Tourists this a great place to buy amenities--water snacks packaged pastries fruit salad etc. it's like a small grocery store/deli. Prices are very reasonable. The establishment is clean and the staff is welcoming. It's also a good place to catch a bite to eat. The deli makes everything fresh and serves Boars Head luncheon meat. We had breakfast here (about $3-$10/person depending what you order) as a break from the over priced hotel breakfasts.  Also I noticed that the local NYC workers would come here to eat or buy items too (which for me is a good sign)." u'Wish zero was an option. Looking forward to dessert. There were some pictures on the sign outside. The display of all the desserts  looked good and the chocolate cake that I got looked delicious. I took one bite and it did not taste good. I am not saying that it was moldy it just did not taste good. I wanted a refund because I did not like what I got. That\'s the way it should be it\'s not like it was a candy bar it was a "bakery" item and it did not taste good. The man at the register did not care and kept showing me the cake from the display. Which I already knew what it look like because I bought some. He was not nice and I got no refund. Actually flat-out rude. I wasted my money on the only dessert I was going to buy while I was in New York City. I guess I experienced a stereotypical New Yorker.\n\nHorrible experience. Very disappointed. Someone that has 100 hundred brain tumors that was looking for a yummy dessert didn\'t get one. Oh did I mention it\'s my birthday? well it is.' u'Excellent place.. n excellent food.. their Place is so clean.. the TSQ food court team were very friendly n helpful.' u"Right when you walk in you immediately know this place is clean.  Its 24 hours.  The space is new but the owner and his trustful employees are seasoned pros.  Their salads are reasonably priced considering how other places are simply rip offs.  Their seating is limited because its really a takeout place.  What really is great is their service.  Ask for Tony and he'll make you an amazing sandwich!" u'Great little place for an inexpensive meal with a smile!  Excellent variety and lots of fresh fruit.' u"This place opened recently in my area and it's a welcomed addition.  I haven't tried their deli/grill foods yet because I never get past the hot food bar which always lures me in with great smelling food. They also sell pre-packaged sushi and have a fruit far. The only negative I've found so far is they don't have enough seating especially during the busy lunch hours. They definitely have the space for more tables and should fill it."],0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0
148.Crisp,[u"Exceptionally good food for a fast + pretty cheap lunch take-out option.\n\nThe burgers can all be made with black bean or falafel patties for those looking for non-meat options and both TRULY hold up (in other words these guys aren't just slapping Boca burgers on a roll and upcharging the hell out of them). They've come up with some novel toppings too - never have I ever had a piece of fried yam on a barbeque burger before trying theirs.\n\nA++++ for Alon and his team! Can't wait to try some of the other menu items." u"Excellent vegan selections. Tasty falafel! \n\nMinus one star because I'm vegan and my food arrived with cheese on it. There was nothing in their ordering system that would lead me to believe that any of the items I selected would have cheese. So they definitely need a better ingredient labeling system.\n\nFood was good though (after I removed all the cheese.) The falafel had both a great flavor and texture. It's rare to find falafel that solidly hits both categories.\n\nI will likely return (and order more carefully) in the future." u"This is a review for Mealpal! \n\nI got the Mexican Shawarma Bowl which was a delicious blend of chicken lamb brown rice lettuce and tomatoes smothered with a smoky chipotle sauce. The chipotle gave every bite a nice spicy kick (but not too spicy). I also liked that the rice helped soak up the sauce.\n\nWhile I highly enjoyed the meal I was left feeling hungry after it. Ironically I was impressed that they put a decent amount of protein in the bowl but I guess it still wasn't enough for my stomach. \n\nAdditionally I went around 1:15 to pick up my Mealpal and it seemed pretty clear that the lunch rush was getting the best of the staff. There was a group of people waiting for their MealPal mixed in with a group of people waiting for their orders. It seemed pretty disorganized as the staff occasionally gave out the MealPals based on the people standing closest to them rather than who arrived first. \n\nIn conclusion while I enjoyed the food I probably won't be back during busy hours and only when I'm not very hungry to begin with." u"The reason they get 4 stars is because of their service not necessarily the food. I came here at lunchtime and it was packed. Literally there was a line out the door. The staff were very friendly even when it was extremely busy and always had a smile on their faces. They had a system to get the food out as quick as they could and were very effective at it. It did take a while but the staff was able to get a ton of orders out.\n\nI got the European sandwich with chicken and lamb and extra tomato pesto which cost about $12. I was not too happy with the food however. I got my sandwich in a naan wrap instead of a pita. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of Mediterranean food but I wouldn't go back." u"I love their Sahara bowl! Recommended by a friend to try this place because their falafels are good and they sure are! The carrots and beets are very tasty as well and I love that this place is vegetarian/vegan friendly. I came at 1pm and there wasn't a long line and my friend and I actually found seating inside. I'll come back!" u"Decided to give Crisp a try since my coworkers raved about how good the food was.\n\nWalking in the location is pretty small. There's about two tables and some chairs by the wall but I wouldn't expect any available seats during the lunch rush hour. \nThe crowd can be a bit intimidating - but no fear as I'm sure 90% of the time it's just a line of people waiting for their food (not waiting to order). \n\nI decided to get the Baja bowl with added chicken as my protein. Although it was crowded i was able to get my food in only five minutes; so the service is fast.\n\nThe food was SO delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection. Surprisingly after tasting the falafel I regretted adding chicken only because it wasn't necessarily needed (that's how good it was). My meal was about $12 and for the amount of food you get - it's worth it. Six hours later and my tummy is still full and happy. I will be returning here for lunch more frequently!" u"Finally a quick Mediterranean food eatery in midtown west! They have a very streamlined ordering/pick up process and plenty of options. I ordered the African bowl with chicken as my protein and pita on the side and the sauce was the perfect level of spicy the falafel was flavorful and the pita was soft and warm. I'm going to tell my coworkers about this spot!" u"Good food but overly priced. $2.50 for a few pieces of veggie meat which I'm told is actually tofu is way too much. I would expect seitan or tempeh instead for that price. Go here if you are in a rush and need a quick bite." u"This place offers some very interest takes on falafel / Middle Eastern street food. Service is quick and the employees are quite helpful when inquiring about how best to construct your order.\n\nThis time I got Europa sandwich with grilled chicken (comes preloaded with falafel) in a whole wheat pita - sundried tomato pesto roasted peppers grape tomatoes parmesan and goat cheese with arugula and balsamic reduction. Combining my love of falafel...and goat cheese thank you lord for this delicious treat.  Plus this thing is pretty ginormously yuuuuuge so while it is some more expensive that than your traditional falafel sandwich ($9.75 reg + $1.50 for chicken add-in + tax) I still think it's well worth the price. Tasty. Solid. Bigly." u"I consider as one of the best lunch in Manhattan.  I recommend the Israeli bowl with its special white dressing.  The chopped tomatoes falafel rice are just delicious.  The share is really fair just perfect for a lunch.  For those of you who are really hungry the pan fries are delicious so delicious!  Do not get there between 12:45pm and 1:30pm during weekdays try at little bit earlier or later otherwise you might end up waiting for like 20-25mins!  Eating there is but when it's packed it's just annoying.  Prefer taking your lunch out and eat on Bryan Park--I did it several times with a friend that's just perfect!  What I have on my pictures was worth $14 great deal!" u"Crisp serves some of the best falafel I've had yet (and I've been to the Middle East). Delicious sauces breads and shawarmas abound here.\n\nDon't be put off by the line. Most of the people waiting have already ordered and Crisp seems to be really quick in the kitchen." u'Chicken in a vegan dish no clear way to order and get your meal. Messy inside no order at all. \n\nPoor experience overall.' u"Great place for Mediterranean fast food. There's plenty of options for personalization so you can definitely make your bowl healthier. \n\nI usually go with the mushroom bowl or the tikka bowl with salmon hummus and lettuce. Their lamb Kafka is also pretty good as well as their falafel. You get to choose your base of hummus greens and or rice. You get a good amount of each so you definitely won't be hungry after. Afterwards you choose a protein and a type of bowl that comes with a variety of different ingredients." u"What an awesome lunch spot next to Times Square. My first time there and totally loving it. I got Israeli Bowl with quinoa humus and greens. It came with 4X falafel. Great combination of flavors.\n\nYou can add meat if you want. I didn't try their homemade bread. Next time which will be soon." u"Favorite veggie burger of all times here! The fries are yummy with sauce as well. \nToo bad this is so far from work for me now and they don't open on weekends. The wait is usually quite long but it helps to order online in advance." u"I order through MealPal from Crisp because it's right across the street from my office. It is my go to choice whenever I don't feel like thinking about what to eat for lunch. But I think I'm done with the chicken bowls because the quality fluctuates from day to day...One day I really love it and another day I absolutely hate it. The chicken bowls are usually too salty..I'd rather you not putting any salt in the food at all..." u'Hands down my favorite lunch spot in Midtown. \n\nThe line may look long but it goes very fast. This is one of the most efficiently run places I have ever seen. \n\nI am a big fan of falafel and every item in this place is based around falafel. After realizing that I knew I loved Crisp. \n\nMy favorite item is the portobello mushroom bowl. It is a bowl filled with half rice half hummus topped with grilled onions and grilled portobello mushrooms with 4 falafel balls. And they give pita on the side ! \n\nThis is the perfect vegetarian meal or even just the perfect meal for someone looking to eat healthier. \n\nEvery item is completely customizable and the staff there will help you decide what to you should order based on what you like. \n\nI also should mention that there are meat options available. But when you are in a place known for their falafel go with the falafel !!!!\n\nI swear by Crisp and recommend it to everyone. I wish they had more locations ! If you work anywhere close by ditch Chic-fil-a for once and go to Crisp !!' u'Came on a Friday around 130 for lunch- still pretty busy.. waited around 10-15 min for my food. \nI got the bowl with rice hummus and veggie patties. The falafel was great the salsa was amazing(could be a little spicier) not a fan of their yogurt sauce tho.. tasted really peanuty. The meal was so big- I had it for dinner too!' u"Great place in midtown to grab lunch. It's usually always packed and has a line out the door during the lunch rush but the line moves quickly. \n\nThe food is great! I always grab a falafel wrap with a side of waffle fries. A must try if you haven't already." u"This place is so good. Lots of healthy options that you can mix and match. Favorite is the Israeli bowl. Service is super fast and friendly and the pita bread is the best I've ever had. It's doughy and fluffy in case your salad doesn't fill you up."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
10.Kungfu Kitchen,[u'Even though most people would complain that they can get the same food in Chinatown for next to nothing if you work near times square this place cant bebeat.\n\nGet the kung fu noodle special. I enjoyed my dish here after watching the Bronx tale on broadway.\n\nService is quick and fast.' u'This place is not for even pseudo health conscious diners.  On the rare occasion I eat noodles I know I\'m in for a diet unfriendly meal.  I like to balance my "bad" meal with raw vegetablesor a salad.  They have only ONE dish that falls in that category Cucumber with Garlic.  Otherwise the menu is all carbs.\n\nI ordered the Kung Fu Noodle w/Special Spicy Sauce.  It was tasty but I wouldn\'t order it again.  It was swimming in grease.  So much so that I couldn\'t finish the pork which was the best part.\n\nIf you don\'t care about what you eat go for it.  The noodles were tasty.  If you have a food conscious stay away and keep looking for a more balanced meal.' u"This is part of the same restaurant a few doors down but because they're so close this particular location didn't have its own page--but I think there should be a separate page since the ambience and the staff are very different.\n\nThis Chinese restaurant offers a bit different slate of offerings than most typical Chinese places you see. Their food items are largely divided into: buns rice and noodles. I think their specialty is the noodles because I see a lot of customers eating them all the time. They come in cold noodles with spices or noodle soups.\n\nThey also have some smaller items like dim sum options (mostly dumplings or shu mai) and appetizers like scallion pancakes.\n\nSERVICE: excellent. They are very attentive and fast. I'd say this location has better service than the other place because it seems less crowded. Because it has a narrow passageway with fewer tables it seems less crowded. When I was there there was someone constantly checking up. The food came out really fast.\n\nFOOD: pretty good and the novelty of a different menu is certainly a plus. I ordered kungfu noodle with special spicy sauce--it tasted a bit like szechuan style (I could be wrong) but it was not all that spicy so if you're worried I think you should be fine.\n\nI'm less enthused about the scallion pancakes. Though I liked that it was not too greasy it was a bit bland and too chewy." u'Good XLB (not quite at Din Tai Fung standard for the wrapping but the soup and meat were good and it was tasty) and good ramen noodle and stir fry options.  There are actually two locations near each other and I went to the smaller one (a few doors uptown) which had a better waiter/seats ratio.' u"I don't have any idea how come they service charge my bill they think I'm tourist people doesn't know how to tipping. Food just okey\nJust be careful when you guys eating here must double check your bill before pay" u'Beware: they already include a mandatory "service charge" of 15% in the main itemized receipt.\nBut you have no way to see it from the credit card charge receipt that still includes a complimentary tip. Worst part is that they are not upfront about it and expect you to "double tip". Dishonest and against what a discretionary service tip should be...' u'This was SO delicious. We got there around 6:30 and managed to walk right in. The hype is true!' u"The poke chop is juicy . Wonton casserole & special spicy noodle are very delicious. Don't forget the sweet plum juice." u'Best noodles in midtown west clean fresh and great serviceold time China Town beef noodle pork noodles great homemade dumplings' u"The food is very good here and service is prompt. HOWEVER examine your bill. They automatically add a tip no matter if you are in a group or alone. Then they staple the receipt so you can't easily see it."],-0.3181,0.0,0.813,0.187
20.Ippudo Westside,[u"This place might have some of the best ramen in town. We had really good service and the servers were very attentive. We ordered the akamaru modern ramen and the karkamen. For the appetizers we ordered the beef tongue bun and the crispy pork belly skewer. They also brought out a green tea chocolate lava cake. Also got a green tea that might be the best tea I've ever had it wasn't the tea that you just put tea bags and leave it. Very flavorful.\n\nRamen: they were both good but the akamaru modern was hands down the best ramen. Perfect amount of saltiness and flavor to it. The noodles for both were not over cooked and the pork belly was flavorful. The mushrooms were also really juicy.\n\nAppetizers: Beef tongue buns and pork belly skewers were really good. I don't normally like eating beef tongue but it was really good. Really tender on the inside an crispy on the outside. The bun was nice and soft and the sauce was the star of the dish. The pork belly skewers were perfectly crispy and salty the way they're supposed to be made.\n\nDessert: it was really good. They had their pastry chef in that decorated it for a birthday in the group. Not overly sweet or rich." u'Ramen lovers have likely either dined at or heard of Ippudo. I finally had my first taste during my recent visit to New York and as a result I now understand the buzz around their bowls of slurpy thin noodles.\n\nI actually dined here twice in less than 5 days and between the Karaka-Men and Akamaru Modern(although both contained their pork broth) I personally prefered the former as the Akamaru was not spicy enough for my taste.\n\nThere will more than likely be a wait to secure a table or a seat at the bar so this is not a get in and out quickly spot. We tried the Ippudo Wings and although messy I would recommend you try it once. Not too salty with a nice side of cabbage salad. Service is efficient and friendly enough. Solid experience enough for me to want to swing by again during my next visit to the Big Apple.' u"My group of 3 came here on a Sunday at around 6pm. We were told it would be a 45-minute wait. No problem! We walked 2 businesses over to ViceVersa and enjoyed some $1 oysters during the wait. They text you when your table is ready. Make sure you have your entire party or else they will not seat you. \n\nI went with the Akamaru Modern with a flavored boiled egg which comes in a very flavorful broth. Really take the time to enjoy the bowl. Every bite is decadent. I also ordered the karaage   chicken which was good but they ran out of the dipping sauce and did not offer any alternative so it was a little disappointing. They were also very slow on refilling our waters which I think is essential given the amount of sodium everything has.\n\nOverall food was amazing service was mediocre at best and atmosphere is loud so don't expect to enjoy your company much. It's all about the food here." u"Multiple people had recommended this place while also warning me about the crazy wait times. Arriving at 9:30pm this place was still slammed and there was still a 45 minute wait time! Dang now this place better be good. As we waited we skimmed through all the Yelp reviews to figure out what we wanted. \n\nThe place itself is quite cozy with just a few small tables along with a central bar with surround seating. The service was great and gave really good recommendations. We ended up trying the Marigold soju for $10. It was a really nice flavor went down smooth. It also came with a really nice customized jar which was a nice keepsake. The husband tried akaramen modern $16 with an added boiled egg. The noodles were cooked perfectly the meat was succulent and the flavors of the broth were well balanced. Overall it was a good bowl of ramen. I had the ka-rakamen $16. It wasn't very spicy but the flavors of the broth were on point. It was in my opinion better and more rich in flavor compared to the akaramen. It is definitely something I would repeat the next time I am here. \n\nThe biggest con is the wait time. I'm not sure if I would wait as long the next time but if I ever really crave ramen maybe just maybe I will." u"We all enjoy lil tongue every now and then ;)\n\nScrew waiting in line with your friends! It was chilly outside and I needed to get some Ippudo ramen stat!  The fastest way is to go by yourself or check in as singles. I was able to get seated in 5 mins while others with groups of 2 or more waited 90+ mins.  Seriously if you came with a friend check in separately as a party of 1. The customer turnover at the bar is quick.\n\nToday's special was the beef tongue bun.  I'm a tongue fiend so I can eat these all day! The meaty cow tongue was panko battered. The tender tongue was rich and slightly crisped.  The dressing complimented the tongue well. It was a blend of wasabi Japanese mayo and mustard. So guess tangy and creamy with a lil kick.\n\nOn to the ramen. I got the hakata classic ramen. In general I enjoyed the ramen. But not enough for me to crave it. Why so? First it wasnt presented well it just looked like it was semi-haphazardly placed into a bowl. Where's the attention to the details. The excellent noodles had a nice snap to it. the Tonkotsu broth while tasty just lacked depth and nuance. Maybe I couldnt taste it too well as the broth was insanely hot when it was served.  Maybe I couldn't taste it because the ginger and bamboo shoots had such a strong flavor they both overpowered the broth.  Don't get me wrong still good but i just expected one of the best ramen joints in town to have more depth complexity and nuance in the broth. The chasu tasted great but I wish it was more melt in your mouth. The pork was on the lean side.\n\nService was on par with other Japanese places. I was surprised that I was required to tip.  Conclusion: excellent ramen restaurant but it felt like a very good american ramen place. It just didnt make me want to crave japan. Maybe it's the way the details were presented to me." u"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Great ramen delicious fatty broth.  Get's busy so prepare for a wait.  We went on Sunday at 4:45 and only had about a 20 minute wait.  So either hit this place up during off hours or go solo" u"The ramen here is good and the place makes you feel like you're in Japan! The menu and the staff embody Japanese culture and are very welcoming. \n\nThe ramen noodles are thin with a good texture and soak in a super creamy delicious broth. The classic came with bamboo which I really like. Be sure to add an egg! Soft boiled perfection. If you finish your ramen extra noodles are only $2 and is the same portion as you start with so it's worth it. \n\nLiked the environment and the service. I've had slightly better ramen before but you can't go wrong here. Portions are okay prices are on the pricey side. \n\nFood: 4.25/5\nValue: 3.5/5\nService: 4.5/5\nOverall: 4.25/5" u'*Review is only for ramen*\n\nLiving in LA I\'ve had my fair share of ramen so I knew I had to go to Ippudo and see what\'s up. I went to the westside one because I was not tryna deal with east village lol.\n\nI came on a weekday afternoon alone so I got seated pretty quickly at the bar. I liked the U-shape table and felt it was more efficient than having servers go around everyone. TBH the price caught me a little off guard. Ramen in LA ranges from $10-$14 (with toppings) but it was  just as much here just for the base. Like damn - gotta get dat egg tho.\n\nI got the Karaka Men: "tonkatsu (pork) soup noodles with ippudo\'s special blend of hot spices topped with pork chashu sesame kikurage mushrooms onion minced pork and scallions." \n\nNoodles were not the wavy kind but straight and thin. Egg was perfect with a slightly runny yolk. The reason I\'m giving Ippudo 5 stars is not for the noodles but for THE BROTH.\n\nIt is the first time where I practically cleaned my bowl out and drank down the broth. Lots of ramen places I\'ve been to (Tsujita Shinsengumi Santouka etc.) have good noodles or nice chashu but Ippudo is the first ramen I\'ve been to with a broth that possessed all the depth of long-cooked umami flavor without heavy oils.\n\nIt was a thin broth but packed with so much flavor - definitely at the top of my ramen list!' u'Went here with some coworkers and it was supposed to be an hour wait on a Monday night but they got us in in only 30 min. We ate the pork buns and each got the spicy ramen with a soft boiled egg added in. Overall the buns were delicious wish the lettuce was a little crunchier (have loved ones in the past using cabbage small shreds) but still delicious. The ramen broth made the dish. The thinner noodles were not the best the group had had but the broth was amazing. Would go back again!' u"We were feeling a little hungry after watching Cats (which was much weirder than we though) and decided to try out Ippudo which happened to be nearby. It was probably around 10:45 when we arrived and there was almost no wait for a table of three. Here's what we had:\n\nShiromaru Hakata Classic - 3/5 - This is their classic ramen with a Tonkotsu pork broth. Honestly the noodles were quite good but the broth was nothing to shout about. I felt it was a little bland but I do like my ramen broths to be thick and rich. The chashu was average as well and the portion size could definitely be larger.\n\nTori-Shio - 4/5 - This ramen had a clear-ish chicken/pork blend broth which I actually quite enjoyed. I thought this was a stronger dish than the classic. Went really well with the chashu/egg and the little prawn chip was a nice touch. Excellent noodles once again but overall not quite enough to be among the best.\n\nHirata Chicken Wings - 4/5 - Very well fried perfectly moist on the inside while being crispy on the outside. Sauce was just a little too sweet but overall quite enjoyable.\n\nFood aside service was attentive and fast. Waters were constantly refilled but the $5 charge for a pot of tea seemed a bit stingy given that the ramen was almost $20 per bowl. All in all it wasn't a bad meal but given the price and Ippudo's reputation it was a bit of a letdown. There are probably better options in the city..." u'Did my research on places to eat for my visit to NY.  On this particular day I was roaming the nearby Central Park area.  Ippudo just so happens to be located close by with in walking distance of Central Park.\n\nUpon entering Ippudo we were greeted and welcomed by the wonderful staff members.  We opted to sit at the bar by the kitchen so we can watch them making ramen in live action.  I ordered the "Karaka-men" which consists of thin noodles in tonkotsu broth with hot spices and garlic oil.  I asked them to hold the cabbage as I thought that was weird having cabbage in ramen and I asked them to add corn and an extra nitamago (seasoned boiled egg).  I liked that my soup had just the right spice to it.   The broth was really flavorful I really enjoyed it.  The one thing I was disappointed with was their pork chashu.  It was over cooked and dry.  The Hubby agreed.  We kind of gave each other that look when we bit in to our meats.  He ordered the "Shiromaru Hakata Classic".   I\'ve had better chashu back home in San Diego.   Overall the good outweighs the bad here.  If ever I take another trip to NY I\'d definitely come back and try the chicken instead of pork chashu.' u"I'm a pretty big ramen fan and have tried most of the top spots in NYC and a few others around the US. The only reason I waited this long to try Ippudo was the long wait times whenever I showed up. We finally visited at 11:15am on a Sunday and we were sat right away. Within 15 minutes the restaurant was full and there was already a line outside. \n\nThe ramen was fantastic. Easily the best I've had to date. We all had the spicy tonkatsu ramen and we ordered a few appetizers which were also incredible. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient. I highly recommend Ippudo for anyone looking for a great ramen experience." u"I remember eating ippudo ramen when I was in Japan and while the ramen was good it wasn't particularly memorable. fast forward to ippudo NYC.. the ramen broths were very different and very tasty! It was an expensive bowl of ramen for sure but definitely worth it. We went around noon on a weekday and Surprisingly there was only a 5-10 min wait. Maybe just an Unusually slow day but I guess we lucked out!" u'We loved Ippudo!\n\nWe had these soft shell beef tounge and OMG! IT was amazing! I think it was a seasonal special but if you get a chance enjoy that!\n\nThe ramen was good as well. Coming from Vancouver our ramen standards are pretty high but given that it is NYC! Ippudo did an amazing job!' u"One of the best ramen places I've ever tried! We flew in from Los Angeles left our belongings at our hotel and we were looking for a good place to have breakfast lunch. It was a little past 11am when we got there so as soon as we walked up we were seated immediately. I was blown away at house quickly the place got packed in an hour. \n\nNow this place is known for its popular pork buns. So we decided to try that first and they were so good! The pork buns are a must do as an appetizer. \n\nFor ramen we asked our waiter for some suggestions and he gave us a couple choices so we went with the Karaka Ramen and it was so amazing. Hands down the best ramen place I've ever been to. Everything was so fresh and good I wish there was a great place to eat like this in Los Angeles. They even offered to give us extra noodles when they saw we were finishing with our bowl. \n\nOur service was friendly and quick. We didn't feel rushed. So if you don't want to wait in line come in as soon as it opens because as we were walking out the line was out the door." u"Been to this location a few times and admit they do have good ramen. I do feel that it is a bit overhyped as there is nothing that makes them stand out from other ramen taste wise. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is great. I love the bar seating and just feeling like part of a community enjoying great food. The bar area is nice and they have a great selection of sake. \n\nThe pork buns are really good and have just the right amount of sauce that's not overpowering. The fluffy bao mixed in combo with the pork are to die for. \n\nI wish the spicy ramen was a bit spicy. The place is also a little pricey as a bowl of ramen can easily run you over gently dollars. I do thing an egg should just be a standard included in a bowl." u'It\'s been awhile since I\'ve was here. And I\'ve had it only twice but it was the First NYC ramen bowl I had.\n\nThe reason it didn\'t get 5 stars is because of the "over"hype perhaps in my mind. Since the inception of boutique ramen- 10+ years ago Ippudo has garnered so much attention and I\'ve heard and yearned to try it long before I actually did... and of course by the time I got to it I\'d expect it to knock my socks off! Not unlike Peter Luger. I\'ve had good ramen outside of NYC in the metro D.C. Area so I was gamed to try the infamous Ippudo. \n\nThinking back now it was so good. Everything about it- except the portion. It should be double the size. Well at least you can buy more noodles... I think they started this marketing genius gimmick actually. And it is a classy lively place to house a divine boutique bowl replete with fancy drinks and delish apps (esp. the pork buns and wings). Those buns sorta deserve their own review actually. Get them.' u'It was difficult to decide which of the many Ramen shops to sample in NYC especially since everyone has their own opinion about what good ramen tastes like to them. I like creamy garlic filled broth with a well marinated boiled egg and damn good and flavorful Charshu. Ippudo did not disappoint with its Akamaru Modern bowl (ordered with extra Nitamago no doubt). Service was great and attentive. Stopped by here on a Sunday right at their 11am opening (no lines btw) but within 15-20 min the place was hopping and the line had started. If I was ever back in town craving a good bowl of Ramen I would definitely wait through the lines (maybe grab a matcha cream puff at Bibble and Sip to bring with you while you wait). \n\nIppudo also gets cool points for their clever soup spoon holders.' u'I wanted to try this place because our izakaya back home supposedly gets their noodles from Ippudo NYC (I think they advertise is on their menus). I love the noodles so I wanted to get ramen from the "source".  \n\nI went during weekday late lunch. The place was fairly packed but I got seated right away. They have so many choices so I asked the waiter what was most popular--he pointed to the spicy tonkatsu ramen.  It comes with chiasu cabbage shredded woodears and scallions. I added a boiled egg and pickled mustard leaves. It came out hot though I thought it could have been bottler temperature-wise. The spicy paste was on top so I just moved that to the little container with the mustard leaves in case it was too spicy. It ended up not being spicy at all. The flavors were good but I guess my biggest disappointment were the noodles. They weren\'t the same wavy noodles from my izakaya. They were straight--not my fave. By the time I got to the bottom it got saltier. \n\nI also got dessert--the mousse with pistachio ice cream. The ice cream was my favorite and the shreds of green tea cake it came with. I wasn\'t a fan of the mousse or the Oreo cookie crumbs. Service was excellent and the ambience on the loud side. They shout welcome in Japanese every time someone walks in.' u'Since I missed out on checking Ippudo when I was in Japan my trip to NY was the perfect opportunity to give this place a try. We got there at 2:30pm on a Saturday and the wait was still 30 minutes. \n\nWhen we finally got seated we ordered our noodles. I had the original since I expected the original to be the best. The ramen and broth was decent but nothing spectacular to write home about. The broth was a bit flat in flavor and just lacked something. I still like Ichiran better.'],0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0
99.Planet Hollywood,[u"Live in NJ have been to the Orlando location and Myrtle Beach locations multiple times and have enjoyed my experience. A friend and I had tickets for an 8pm show and it was roughly 4:45/4:50. We didn't feel like waiting for a table so a friendly woman on the street gave us a 10 dollar coupon. \n\nService was a bit slow for a relatively empty restaurant. We didn't complain because we were in no rush at all. The menus were a bit old and torn. Not too much to choose from (sometimes it is better that way). Friend got the chicken Cesar salad and I got the fajitas. Not too much to mess up. We both enjoyed our meal. \n\nWouldn't say it was terrible but there are obviously better places to dine." u"Typical chain with overpriced merchandise and food alike. However we were happy to see the dinner menu still being served at 10:30pm as we weren't in the mood for food truck fare. \nOur server was friendly and checked on us often. We ordered appetizers and sandwiches. Everything tasted great and came in large portions. Our cocktails were tasty and perfectly poured. They do have a nice sound system with lots of base. Not really a family atmosphere although we noticed families with kids on the night my husband and I stopped in. \nThe bathroom smelled funky and seemed dirty but it could've been the time of night and the fact they were closing soon. \nWe would probably grab drinks here again when in Times Square. Our server was awesome!" u'I went to this place for a class trip and sat in the VIP section. So far not a good experience service has room for improvement and cleanliness is a severe issue. The Environment is overrated and the bathrooms are atrocious. It is safe to say that this place is a one and done type of restaurant . Definitely a dissatisfaction.\n\n\nA review by RodeoRestauarnatReviews' u"I've been coming to this place for years! I love everything about it from the ambiance to the service to the food. Maybe it's a tourist-y place but I happen to love it regardless. Our waiter Seth was awesome; so friendly and conversational we loved him! My boyfriend and I split the ginormous Long Island iced tea with blue cura\xe7ao (sp?)...surprisingly my first Long Island iced tea! Haha...it was delicious and we got a complimentary glass to take home as well as a discounted refill-which we could not finish after our meal! He ordered a mushroom Swiss burger while I got the avocado and Swiss grilled chicken sandwich...the fries were absolutely amazing! Crispy but not greasy! The sandwich was also delicious and had a generous portion of avocado (bonus points for that!) Pretty average prices for the city and it's very spacious inside there was a 5 minute wait on a Saturday night! Can't beat that! We'll come again!" u'The BBQ Cheddar Burger is delicious ! The fries are decent but the smoothie was a little disappointing but still yummy it was described more better but it was really good experience/ food overall !' u'The food was atrocious. Overpriced as everyone else stated and the atmosphere is extremely novelty. Our server Sean was quite delightful. When we got the check we saw the pre priced gratuity were not the actual percentages. Odd.' u'Food is not too bad but the service is absolutely brutal. Our server screwed up our order multiple times. A meal was compt but thats beside the point.' u'Ok food awesome signage and location. This place is busy as expected but the staff is pretty efficient and do an overall good job.' u"The experience is cool; near Hollywood memorabilia and pictures. But the food was just ok.  Mac and cheese tasted like velveta was used instead of real cheese. Wasn't sure if chicken was cooked through so I didn't eat it. \nMy kids liked walking around but maybe just go for dessert." u"Food was tasty waiter was slow at refilling drinks but overall it was a very good experience.\nMe and my sister enjoyed singing along to the Disney playlist they had playing that day. \nWait wasn't too long since we went right after it had snowed. \nOverall it's pretty decent if you have nowhere else to go prices are pretty high but you can order around it." u"I used to go to this restaurant all the time when I was in highschool.  12 years later I wanted to take my cousins new to New York to dinner. When we got their we realized they moved from the corner inward. The entrance that was pretty nice changed. My first hunch was to get up and leave for another restaurant. For some reason I had a feeling it wouldn't be good but I tried to get myself to settle down and stop feeling so negative. Also I think in the move they lost a lot of the essence they had in the other location. Bathrooms used to be so well maintained when I went years ago with well stock toiletries including perfumes. It was pretty classy back then. Now the bathrooms were barely clean and run down looking. The lighting around the  restaurant made me nauseous and it reminded of a cheap motel room. \n\nThe food completely sucked. It was mediocre and seems like a kid put it together. Pasta was overlooked veggie burger was overcooked and dry. The fried rice for a missing this and of a cheap Chinese fast food take out where you can taste the oil and our shrimp fajitas the shrimp taste it so fishy it was unusual. The only thing we liked were the nachos we ordered. \n\nI would say skip this place and opt for the dollar pizzas all over. They taste much better.  I regret spending over $100 on the nasty meal. Service was not the best either. I actually saw one of the kitchen staff use the toilet and not wash her hands when she left the bathroom. I was so disgusted." u'Long long wait on a Tuesday night for sub-decent food that was WAY overpriced.  We undoubtedly paid for the location more than anything else.\n\nOn a positive note our server was very attentive and brought the rating from 1-star to 3-stars just for his effort.' u'Bad food. Bad service. Just bad. Your time and money would be better spent elsewhere.' u'This place was very intriguing from the moment you walk in. It is upstairs. So as your walking you look around and see all the pictures/items on the walls for example comic book strips and a Spiderman on the wall. Then you start to see outfits actors wore from the titanic the Adams family and ghostbusters. It\'s very cool to look around. The hostess was very friendly and pointed out a couple of props up on the wall from classic movies like Ace Ventura and the original King Kong. The ambiance was very upbeat and busy the music played at this restaurants was good music that everyone knows and you can sing along to like Usher "OMG". Very family friendly the menu is large and has a wide variety. We got a margarita pie it was great!' u'Unfriendly waitress dirty bathrooms food is barely average.  \nI will not go back.' u'Have been to other Planet Hollywoods. First time we brought our kids to one. They enjoyed it. Loved all the movie props. Our food was good and so was our service. Not busy which was good. Girls definitely want to come to another one if we ever visit somewhere that has one.' u"Your paying for what here? Location experience and oh yeah food. It's over priced in Times Square for everything but you should know that going in. We liked all of our traditional American food. No frills good taste nice atmosphere nice waitress clean and plenty of space." u"It's pity how this place turned to an empty restaurant with rude service start from the hostess to the waiters \nIt a waste of time and money and a shame if you invite someone there \nMy guess this place will close soon" u"We tried this place and it was okay. The fries were not good and were barely warm some were a little cool. They also offer chips but those were so hard that I didn't even get through the first one. Surprisingly the chicken salad sandwich was pretty good. It came with tomato on toasted wheat bread. The chicken salad was creamy and I think it had some almonds or something slightly crunchy in it. If I ever had to go back I would get the chicken salad again.\n\nThe service was just okay. When we first entered I felt like they were trying to push us off to sit at the bar. The bar area was bar seating and some high top tables which was completely full. Our server was polite but seemed to be over tasked. So we had to wait a while just to order." u'Service was great but food was just average to below average.  Got the nachos and the LA Lasagne.  Neither was very fresh.  Again our server was very good though.'],0.4927,0.347,0.653,0.0
5.Los Tacos No.1,[u"Man...I wish I would've come here sooner. As a native Texan it is hard to get any decent Mexican food around these parts. This place does the job. The tacos are amazing! The service is also quick accurate and straight to the point. Don't let the long line fool you it goes very quickly. I will be a regular.\n\nOh & to top it off...I got to see Tiffany Haddish here!!" u"Huge fan of Los Tacos! Brought me back to my authentic taco times in LA. Order and pay at the counter take your receipt walk to the left hand it to someone who'll add your toppings and consume at the standing tables behind you. Keep in mind there are no chairs but there's lots of space. \n\nI ordered three steak tacos with corn tortillas because I'm all about that protein baby and put mild sauce on one medium on another and spicy on another. The steak is seasoned so well and cooked just right. Don't forget the radishes limes and peppers!" u'During my last visit in New York we just happened to walk by this place right as it was about it open. Let me tell you...I am not a big fan of tacos. The first time I ever really liked this type of food was when I was in Mexico and that was cause...I was in Mexico. Coming across this place as it was just opening for the day was a blessing. Ordering is a bit confusing because we had no idea we had to hand our order to the chefs ourselves. We actually got annoyed stares from the chefs because they thought we were holding up the line due to our confusion. However the food only takes about 5 minutes or less to get to you so no biggie. I think it\'s awesome you get to see everything that the chefs do with the open layout. There is not much space and it is all a standing area. Within the first 10 minutes the whole place was packed. It is definitely a "fast food" type of place but the workers were awesome and able to keep up with the crowd allowing for a fast turnover rate.\n\nThere are 4 different types of meats with different options on how you want them (tacos quesadilla corn or flour tortilla) which I thought was pretty cool. The portions are small but definitely very meat packed. The steak and pork were our personal favorites. The meat is so flavorful and juicy so be careful when eating!! I was wearing white. Napkins and wipes are much needed. My all time favorite was the steak quesadilla it was  Definitely had to go back and get another. If you\'re debating coming here I\'d recommend getting here early or on an off meal time and to grab quite a few as portions are pretty small.' u"I've had Los Tacos before at their Meatpacking District location so I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this location in Times Square. Unlike the Meatpacking District location this location has limited seating aside from several tables and a standing area alongside the windows.\n\nThe orderly process can get quite hectic here. You order at the register once you walk in and you'll receive a receipt after doing so. You then hand that receipt over to the taco-preppers and they'll make your order for you. \n\nI settled for one of each taco that they offered. The pork steak chicken tacos were all delicious. I felt indifferent about the grilled cactus taco since it didn't really have any taste to it. It was worth a try though. \n\nI'd recommend grabbing a stack of tissues since eating these tacos can get quite messy as the juice from the meats would often leak from the tortillas. The venue also offers condiments for your tacos such as limes peppers and mild and spicy salsas." u"So yass taco heaven.\n\nIt is so so so so so so so so good!\n\nMy only issue is my first time there it was really busy and so I didn't know how their ordering worked. You place your order go to the side and hand it to one of the cooks. I wasn't aware and so myself and other confused people all congregated until someone finally told us to move.. LOL which was awkward\n\nTHE HORCHATA IS SO GOOD GET IT GET IT.\n\n\nI really also loved the bowls with different salsas and stuff.\n\nMy favorite taco would be the pork it comes with pineapple and it was amazing." u"[501]\n\nYelp is the best way to find this place. The exterior is kind of plain so it's easy to walk past it especially since there is no seating. There are counters for stand and eat.\n\nThey have different types of juices and different types of salsas/topping.\n\nWe needed something small to eat since we were hungry and still 3 hours out from dinner.\n\nWe ordered two chicken tacos and two chicken tostadas.     The tacos were amazing and did not need anything added.   The tostadas were just as tasty.  I don't like spicy so was happy that the meal only had a very small tang of spicy.  But don't worry.  You will love it.\n\nWe had a coke out of the small glass vintage bottles.\n\nThe staff was friendly and it was nice hearing Spanish music.\n\nWe will definitely be back." u'Yes yes and yes!!!! Was looking for a location near the job to have some healthy eats and came across Los Tacos No.1. The tacos were absolutely delicious and the Jamaica drink was perfect. I was quite disappointed that I only purchased two tacos because they were gone before I realized it. \n\nPros: \nVery fast service\nNicely seasoned chicken\nGreat salsa options\n\nCons:\nTo go option is shabby. I had to walk four blocks and by the time I made it back to the office the paper surround my tacos had become one with my tacos.' u"Really enjoyed their Chelsea market location came to check it out and who says that you cant find decent food in tourist choked times square? Its a no frills spot with standing room only you can get a choice of steak pulled pork chicken or cactus quesadilla tacos and guac and chips. Service is fast food is good and for 3.50 - 5 dollars you can drop by for a quick snack with a corn taco. Tried their chicken steak pulled pork corn tacos and quesadilla. All were good meat was tender and juicy corn tacos were made in house and there were pickled condiments line juice and sauce to balance out the salty meat. Many of the patrons were local office workers didn't get the sense that there were a lot of tourists. \n\nIf you're wandering around time square craving for a snack Los Taco would be the place to be. I still prefer their Chelsea market location tho." u"The original location serves my favorite taco in NYC. This location now serves my second favorite taco in NYC.\n\nThe adobada is what you want. Some may call it al pastor some may simply refer to it as pork and pineapple but anyone with tastebuds knows this thing is delicious. The carne asada is also excellent but adobada is where it's at.\n\nIf you show up around prime lunchtime there will be a line but don't worry my friend. Los Tacos No. 1 has learned from the crowds at Chelsea Market and created the most efficient outpost possible. The line moves quickly. You order your tacos get your tacos load up at the salsa bar (beware those chilis) and eat at the counters provided (standing room only). And you get out so more people can get in and enjoy the adobada.\n\nI think I still prefer the Chelsea Market location tacos...I don't actually know that there's any difference between the two but I'm old and nostalgic these days. \n\nI'm not complaining though. \n\nMore Los Tacos No. 1 locations just mean more meetings I can take so I have an excuse to get tacos before or after more (and different) taco-loving friends I can run into on the street outside and more adobada which means more happiness." u"I was very excited to try this place for dinner after work tonight because of the reviews.  I knew there was no way this place would live up to its current 5 star rating on Yelp as it is a 'cheap' place in the middle of Times Square.   I had to try it though.  The place is easy to miss on 43rd st as there are no bright lights or colorful signs outside.  \n\nWhen you get in you have to go to the counter on the right to order your meal.  They give you a ticket which you then take to the taco chefs to the left of the counter.  You can tell them whether you want corn or flour tortillas and what condiments you want added or withheld.  There were a lot of people when I arrived for dinner tonight (Friday night) and I found the whole experience of ordering and getting your food pretty frenzied and chaotic.  There are a bunch of people waiting for their orders and they have a big sign that says: 'No ticket no taco.'  The taco chefs seemed to get pretty pissed off if someone orders and doesn't give them their ticket pretty quickly; at one point I heard one of the taco chefs tell a kid verbatim what the sign said.  I thought about it for a second and concluded that establishments with attitudes of trying to intimidate customers to follow their ordering procedures are offensive.  Places that I've heard of that do this are Katz's deli and some of the famous cheesesteak places in Philly.  I understand you need to be efficient if your place is busy but if someone is paying for your product they deserve some decent customer service right?  Luckily I followed the instructions pretty carefully for once in my life and got my food after waiting a bit.  Oh and they do not have seats here so you have to eat your meal standing up.  Sucks.\n\nI got one each of the chicken steak and pork tacos along with a bottle of coke.  I think the tacos were like $3.50 or $3.75 each and the bottle of coke was $2.50.  Total came out to $14.43.  I was like damn that's pretty expensive; these tacos better be the best and most hefty tacos I've ever had.  I was disappointed when I saw how small the tacos actually were.  I was further disappointed to see that they only come with one tortilla as opposed to 2 tortillas like how most taco places do it.  The bottle of coke I got was also tiny for $2.50 as they strangely do not have any cans or regular sized plastic bottles of soda.  Sucks.  \n\nOk so the good news is that the tacos are very flavorful and tasty.  The pork taco (I think they call it adobada) was especially insanneeeeeeeeeee.  They put pieces of pineappple in it and it was bangingggg.  I think my eyes ricocheted to the back to my head when I bit into it.  The steak and chicken were very tasty as well and felt a notch above other typical taco places in terms of quality.  So the flavor is definitely there.  The bad news is that I finished each taco in like 2 bites.  :    -    (\n\nSo thus I see why people would rate this place highly especially tourists.  The tacos are good but there are just too many negatives including lack of seating claustrophobic\u200b atmosphere bad customer service and price to product ratio.  Later in the night I got a $5 chicken tenders meal at Wendys which would have been unnecessary if Los Tacos #1 had given me enough food for dinner.  My $5 chicken tenders meal was about the same amount of food as my meal here and was 1/3 the price.  So I would not recommend this place as there are plenty of better options for tacos in NYC." u"Thank you Yelp - which is what brought me to this place. The best tacos I've ever had! If you are looking for a quick bit and some amazing food this is the spot!\nI had the chicken tacos and carne asada. (I'm salivating just thinking about it!) The only real difference between tacos and quesadillas are that the quesadillas are slightly bigger and have cheese.\nI highly recommend this spot.\nI just which they had some chairs but no big deal." u"It would be hard for me to put into words what already has been said here prior but this is a mandatory NYC spot. \n\nEven if you were to just come for a quick stop-in for a snack- get their adobado taco. \n\nIt consists of perfectly marinated pork al pastor style pineapple onions cilantro and just the right amount of spice.\n\nDon't be dismayed by a long line. They move quickly and it's a good sign. You order receive a ticket and hand it to one of the workers down the line. You'll soon be in taco bliss. \n\nThere are limes on the line as well as multi-level spice salsas on the left wall." u"Tried the pollo (chicken) taco and it was ok. I was not able to top it off with salsa since there were too many people blocking the counter. The cubed chicken was tender and not flavorful by itself. The avocado salsa it came with was lacking salt. I don't think I had any cilantro on my taco either. Corn tortilla was soft and not overheated (crispy).\nQuick service and had to fight the crowd to get noticed - pay first then hand receipt to cook for order to go through." u"Brought a gaggle of coworkers here for lunch a couple of Fridays ago around 1 pm. Line out the door complete with bouncers. Fortunately they hustle you through and we must have waited less than five minutes to order.\n\nOnce inside it's pretty loud and hectic. You are frantically rushed through your order. I get it they have a lot of people to serve but I was so stressed I forgot to order my horchata.\n\nI got a cactus (nopal) quesadilla and a chicken (pollo asado) taco for $4.25 and $3.50 respectively. Not as cheap as your neighborhood truck obviously but not bad for Times Square.\n\nYou pass your order along to your equally rushed taco maker along with your desired toppings and you have your food within minutes. It's served on standard paper plates and then you stand to eat it. I guess you could take it along with you but I can't see it traveling well and you're gonna need napkins when you're done. Hard to find a good place to stand with this many people jockeying for space though.\n\nMy chicken taco was good quality but a little too spicy and entirely too soupy. The nopal quesadilla had similar leakage problems but was much more delicious. If you've had good authentic Mexican before this is it no less and definitely no more.\n\nI wouldn't rush back so long as the mobs of tourists remain but mostly lived up to the hype." u"Simple straightforward and glorious. This place has risen like a mirage in the improving but still somewhat barren desert that can be Times Square dining options.  The bright stark Mexican-diner decor is simple fun and welcoming.  The small menu is listed on the wall--the food is sensational and uber-authentic--you can't go wrong with whatever you choose off that menu.\n\nAmong the taco/tostada options my personal favorite is the Adobada taco (corn tortilla of course)--you can get any taco con todo--with cliantro onions guacamole and salsa but the pork taco comes with two little strips of pineapple on top which provide a perfect sweet complement to the perfectly spiced taco.  The most amazing thing on the menu however is the Especial advertised as a quesadilla but really a quesadilla/empanada hybrid--they slice open the pocket of fried cheese and load it with whatever meat you add and all of the taco toppings...it one of the best things I've eaten in some time.  And surely one of the healthiest.  Right?\n\nAs if the food weren't enough in addition to mexican sodas or a horchata you have the option order an authentic bottle of Mexican Coke with that sweet sweet real sugar to wash this excellence down.  Prices are quite reasonable and there is ample (standing-room only) area to stand and enjoy or take back to your office (or hotel as the case may be).  Just a perfect option for lunch or a quick dinner." u"So .. I'm from Los Angeles. Home of the street tacos. There is a taco truck on almost every block. People selling it off their driveways. I know tacos. \n\nWe've tried ALOT of tacos in our lifetime. When I heard there was a NY restaurant that gives LA tacos a run for its money I was intrigued. You place your order. Hand your ticket to the chef and watch him assemble. \n\n1st thing I noticed was the owner was cleaning up around the restaurant greeting people. When it started getting busy he put on his apron and started cooking. Loved that. I think he made our order too. \n\n2nd thing was fresh toritillas made on the spot. They were so soft and had good hold.. leading to ...\n\n3rd the tacos were twice the size of LA tacos. But of course twice the $$. Had no problem paying for that.\n\nWe got one of each of the:\nAdobada Taco\nCarne Asada Taco\n\nSadly we had another meal plan after so we couldn't eat anymore but my husband kept insisting that we go back and get more tacos later. \n\n$12 for 2 tacos and a soda\n\nMust try ! Lives up to the hype!" u"Had to try the tacos here after seeing the raving Yelp reviews. I ordered the Adobada and asada tacos with jaimaca Fresca. The meats were really tender and well flavored. The asada was definitely much better than the Adobada though. \n\nThe tacos are portioned well and you get a good amount of meat. The prices are on the high end for tacos but you're paying for some really great quality. Service is super quick. There's limited standing eating room but people are in and out very frequently. \n\nFood: 4.75/5\nValue: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nOverall: 4.5/5" u'This was a pleasantly surprising experience! We were just in the area and starving and we came across this little joint. It\'s very casual... So casual that there are no seats LOL. I was a vegetarian and there was only one option for me. The grilled cactus tacos/quesadillas/plates. Vegetarians should not get the "plate" option because the beans have pork lard. The staff was knowledgeable enough to inform me of this before finalizing my order. I was very appreciative of this because many restaurants don\'t know these details about their menu and people end up breaking their dietary restrictions. The tacos were delicious especially after adding the numerous sauces on their sauce wall. My fianc\xe9 ordered pork tacos (adobado) and he loved them as well!\n\nOverall the vibe is very friendly and chill. Additionally it is very affordable. But do not come here if your legs are aching and you want to place to sit down. Highly recommend!' u'Food was great....get the off menu Taco w the cheese shell  horchata is good and salsa is on point' u"Just as good as the Chelsea location but even bigger. It's a great quick stop before a show or commute from port authority. I prefer the tacos more than the quesadilla because it's essentially the same ingredients. My favorite is the carnitas and chicken with corn tortilla (which tends to be more flavorful). \n\nWe got everything on the tacos and then realized that we forgot the self-serve salsa to the right of the counters.\n\nNo chairs for seating standing counters only. \n\nBe sure to give your receipt to one of the chefs after ordering at the register. That's when they start making your food."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
173.Haru Sushi,[u'On a leisure Saturday afternoon we came to Times Square to see Thor. After a great movie we wanted to grab a bite to eat. We stumbled across this place. It was relatively crowded but we were seated without reservations within 15 minutes. I had the lemongrass soup with shrimp scallops and mushrooms. It was sooooo delicious. It was spicy just enough to get you warm and draw you in to slurp until the last noodle was gone! We had a variety of rolls including the granmercy spicy crunch salmon salmon jalape\xf1o and some others. We had the shishito peppers and edamame to start. Both were delicious. The sale was great and the green tea ice cream with brownies were awesome. \n\nThe service was good and Ryan was great. I plan to bring my girlfriends here when they are in town in two weeks!' u"My go to sushi spot. I love Haru. They are always consistent with the menus and food quality. They have a clean kitchen and establishment. Which is important to me if you couldn't tell by my other reviews .\nI love love  love their brown rice avocado rolls and they have the best spicy mayo. \nNever had a bad meal there in 6 years and I eat there 3x a week." u"Relatively busy for a weekday evening. Made reservations off of open table before coming just in case but turned out to be unnecessary; was seated immediately upon arrival. The ambience and decor was nice but it seemed a little cramped. We were seated in the section with a long booth bench that ran along the wall and chairs on the other side. The tables are so close together that you need to move the entire table to get in or out. The tables in the middle of the room had chairs that backed into the neighboring tables' chairs. I suppose being in Times Square space is a luxury. \n\nWaitress came to take our drink order then disappeared for 15minutes. Our tea came and we were finally able to order. I'm accustomed to having complimentary tea when going to a Japanese restaurant but it seems of late more and more places are charging for it; $3 an order but though we ordered one for each of us we were only charged for one. We also received two Miso soups for free. I suspect the waitress was compensating for the lack of service earlier. We had the sushi and sashimi for two as our entree but was not impressed. Sadly I've had better even in Queens!" u"Not exactly imaginative when it comes to rolls but their raw fish is fresh! And what's up with mango sauce on half of their roll menu? Is that a NY thing?\n\nLooking for a Japanese place for our last dinner in NYC I changed my mind to this restaurant instead of a yakitori place two streets down. Practically in the middle of Times Square! Large layout with plenty of tables. Found it ironic the host asked if I had a reservation when not even a third of the place was full. There's a full bar with seating.\nSuper nice staff! Teguh as his name is typed on the receipt was extremely accommodating professional and patient. He complimented our choices and refilled water as soon as our glasses reached half empty.\n\nDrinks all around! I got the passion coco mojito (passion fruit with coconut milk) which had a tangy kick that irritated my throat but was much sweeter than the medicinal tasting lycheetini. We couldn't finish that. Prosecco and Asaki were satisfactory.\n\nWe ordered the plentiful sushi/sashimi for 2 ($66) and three rolls averaging around $18 each:\n\nMadison Ave-- mango sauce on this one topped with tuna black masago caviar and shiny edible gold leaf foil\nHell's Kitchen-- fresh salmon a light drizzle of sriracha on avocado crunchy? spicy tuna interior also had black caviar\nSpicy Titanic-- lots of fresh salmon and avocado topped with savory salmon roe\n\nToo bad they don't have any soft shell crab here for spider rolls. There was probably only one roll with shrimp tempura inside the name had Fantasy in it." u"My aunt my sister and I come to Haru three times a year. Once for each of our birthdays. We've been doing this for about three to four years now. I don't think I've been to any other restaurant in NYC more times than I have Haru. And it's not because the food is great but it's more out of convenience. At some point we all worked in midtown so it was the midpoint for all of our offices. Plus my aunt was always raving about it so we always just came here by default. Little by little we've noticed that the quality has been going down. We collectively decided that this past time for my aunt's August birthday was the last time we will go there. \n\nThere's nothing or at least no 'last straw' that really triggered this decision although there was something on my sister's plate that looked like a bug which the manager kept trying to convince us it was seaweed. (I don't know about you but the seaweed I eat typically doesn't have legs but OK.) It's really just a mix of things. The quality of the sushi is fine but not great. It's similar to what you would order for takeout sushi but three times the price. And I know it's all about the location so for Times Square you need to expect higher prices. But it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. The quality is not worth the price point that they charge. Especially since we always miss happy hour which ends ridiculously early at 6.\n\nIt seems the majority of its patrons are tourists drinking Fiji from a wineglass or drunken businessmen. Really not the type of experience i'm looking to have. I'm sure you can find a ton of better sushi places nearby which is what we plan to do for the next birthday." u"What can I say .... I'm a sushi snob and should have known better. Crappy service and blah blah food. I guess it works for 'tourists' .... sorry 'D - must try harder'" u'Went here for a team lunch at work and throughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe place is very modern and takes reservations! We got there around 11:30 before the lunch rush and was seated right away.\n\nI ordered the salmon bento and substituted the cali roll for the salmon avocado roll. The lunch bento is around $20 and is a pretty good deal.\n\nIt comes with miso soup which was standard tasting but I love miso soup so I was happy. Rice is also included.\n\nThe salmon had a crisp skin and cooked perfectly. So juicy although they could have used a bit more teriyaki sauce. There was this fried shrimp potato crisp that was very good and surprisingly filling. The salmon avocado was was fresh but you only get 6 pieces. \n\nOverall it was good good +sushi which is more than I can ask for!' u"Pretty good sushi for Times Square. Great for corporate lunches or dinners. Haru won't blow you away but it's reliable and good quality sushi. It's in Times Square so I wouldn't travel here unless you work in the area. \n\nSome of the rolls are creative so have fun with them - there's one with strawberries and jalape\xf1os and another with gold foil. They also have fun (and slightly dangerous) cocktails. \n\nIf you're going for a work function (which is the only reason I'd step foot in Times Square) request the semi-private room in the back." u"My first experience with Haru Sushi was during Hurricane Sandy when they delivered to Cassa Hotel where I was staying due to the storm. I've been there many times since for dine-in and takeout both during lunch and dinner. Every experience has been exemplary and their food still delicious after all these years. I preferred the dark sultry ambiance pre-renovation with bamboo and Asian touches throughout. After their remodeling a couple years ago the space is now more modern and a bit austere. But they're still an excellent choice for sushi in the Times Square wasteland. For lunch I always enjoy their salmon teriyaki bento box with brown rice shrimp kakiage California roll and miso soup. For the amount of food it's a great deal at $20. Their specialty rolls are very good as well with my favorite being the Spicy Titantic roll - salmon avocado and caviar wrapped around crunchy spicy tuna which is everything delicious in one bite. Their sashimi is delicious you can taste the freshness of the fish and they know this so minimal sauces are added to allow the fish to shine.\n\nThe menu items I would skip are their tempura rolls. The fried seafood roll shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura have all been disappointing in the past tasting like seafood deep-fried to disguise their impending expiration. Fresh is the best at Haru from their eel avocado to the crunchy spicy salmon to their tuna and salmon avocado rolls. I find them to be consistently good and service always accommodating making them one of the strongest choices in the Theater District." u'Came here on a Friday around 930pm to have a quick bite. It was surprisingly empty but I decided to sit at the bar area anyways. My general rule of thumb is to sit at the bar over a table because service seems to be quicker. \n\nThe food was decent here:\nAppetizer The Symphony- it had spicy tuna salmon tartare king crab an assortment of caviar all on top of a wasabi sauce. It tasted fresh and the wasabi sauce gave it a good kick. Good size for sharing. \n\nSpecialty roll Gramercy Park- albacore tuna salmon and yellowtail a hint of spice from the jalape\xf1o balanced with the acidity of the lemon and yuzu miso sauce made a great tasting roll.\n\nTip: heavy pour of alcohol by the bartender' u"Even in spite of the fact that the server knocked a full pint glass of ice water on my lap the food here just isn't that good. Very Americanized (if you like standard Americanized rollups with stuff like avocado and jalape\xf1os tho they're good at making them).\n\nSome reasons this place isn't for me:\n1. The miso black cod appetizer tasted to us like regular cod. I obvs can't prove what it was after the fact nor do a genetic test on what I ate but New Englanders know our cod and what we ate did not taste to us like black cod/sablefish. If it really was black cod the restaurant did an amazing job making it taste like regular east coast cod. \n2. Fishy sea urchin/uni that cost $6/bite\n3. $8.50 for a liter of Fiji still water\n4. Hard sushi rice\n5. Poorly cut sashimi... etc.\n\nI do appreciate the prompt service (except for the klutzy water mishap) but because this food is mediocre and expensive even adjusting for midtown Manhattan pricing I probably won't be back." u'Terrible place!!!! You come in get a table start ordering after a hard day at work and they got the nerve to ask you to get up and move to a worse table just bc by some means that specific table is reserved. WTF. Hate Haru! Safe yourself from that terrible place' u"Ok so we had 45 min until our show started! Lost our reservations at the original restaurant because of the lovely construction on the tunnel as well losing the toll jobs. :(.. \nThere was also snow which added to the traffic. I calculated ... just put it in park on my gps lol\n\nAll worked out! Parked the car and asked which way to go to possibly find food?? (I was totally hangry!) driving in NYC with hangriness is not safe.. for other. \n\nSo I ran down forgot my sweater and found this lovely place. They squeezed us in and then served so fast! They also kept track on when our show started! I wanted Chilean seabass but it would have taken so long but I couldn't make a decision (computer malfunction from lack of nutrition!) well they rushed it! So kind and well serviced. \n\nBest fish ever!!!!!! My dad got cod and that was amazing also. I can't even explain in a fancy way only silly because the show and possibly the sake haha" u"Was visiting NY and wanted to get some japanese food. Haru sushi had sushi for pretty good prices. The food itself was also great! Fish seemed fresh and they had unique dishes. We ordered the sashimi salad and for sushi entre\xe9s we ordered the sashimi plate and chirashi. I would totally recommend the sashimi salad I haven't eaten anything like it before. All the dishes met my expectations and I also got to enjoy it in a nice comfortable restaurant. \n\nPrices:\nSashimi salad ($15)\nSashimi plate ($20)\nChirashi ($29)" u"Great Food! Service wasn't bad. Seated within minutes! A little pricy." u'Everything was amazing! Must try the Kabocha appetizer simply delicious. Had the gramercy roll and the kiss the fire roll both are a must try but the kids the fire roll was my favorite. Very nice ambiance good setting for casual or romantic dinner.' u'Lovely place right in the heart of Times Square! Recommendations: vegetable spring rolls any of the maki hand rolls seaweed salad berries & bubbles (cocktail). Also highly recommend their sake flights! We had a great table right next to the window overlooking the Lyric Theater. Definitely best to make reservations ahead of time!' u"We ordered Hell's kitchen sushi roll pineapple sushi rolls and sushi and sashimi. The ambiance is nice. Light was dim waiters were friendly food was amazing. My favorite was hells kitchen sushi roll and yellow tale sashimi.. The yellow tail is like butter in your mouth. So soft and smooth. The presentation was appealing. We ended up paying around $80+ but we were full in the end of the meal. A little pricey but we're in Manhattan so.... Lol" u"My go to spot for lunch meetings in Times Square and I think I've been here 2 or 3 times now.  Make sure you make a reservation or beat the lunch rush because it fills up quickly.  One thing that really stands out to me is that the staff is extremely friendly and they are very attentive.  \n\nI've tried appetizers (edamame gyoza dumplings) and for entrees I've had chicken katsu as well as a few different roles.  The food always comes out as expected and quickly.  I highly recommend checking out this place if you are in the area." u'Worst sushi place ever! The service was terrible our waitress was in a hurry and made it very obvious that she wanted to rush us.. the food was not that great and the sushi was not very flavorful.. definitely would not recommend this place to friends or family.'],-0.7825,0.06,0.73,0.211
35.Patzeria Family & Friends,[u'Ate my pizza and salad on the way to JFK delicious and hit the spot. Anastasia at the register helped us figure out our train route since it was raining and the train stations were down for maintenance.\n\nReally great service got my order within 15 minutes with everything I needed. Local and family vibe - would recommend!' u"Came here with family and friends while visiting. The service was great the food was OK... best canolis ever. \n\nThe tomato basil pizza was thin and crispy as I asked but had so much garlic on it that I had to scrape it off. The garlic knots were tasty just a bit too bready for my taste. The Caesar salad has too much dressing. The mozzarella sticks (which I usually don't like) were actually some of the best I've had! The marinara was ok a bit lacking in flavor." u"This place is the bomb.com!!  we ordered 5 personal pizzas all different. \n1.cheese and onion \n2.cheese and garlic\n3.cheese ricotta and basil 4.Cheese and bacon 5.Cheese and pepperoni. The pizza is very large 10inches the toppings fresh and delicious. The staff I must say are wonderful happy and fun to interact with.  I felt they actually really cared about our dining experience. They were adorable Thank you!!! Then they gifted us these wonderful Cannoli's holy crap!!! The best i have ever had I really think you should give it a try specially a family of 5.. Thank you so so much!!!  We will be back!!" u'While on vacation I noticed this place as it was right next to our hotel. (the belvedere) I picked up a large pepperoni pizza to go and requested extra sauce. The host was very welcoming and seemed genuinely glad to see me even though they were busy and was just ordering a simple pizza. I took this beautiful pie up to the room and all I can say is WOW! Crazy good and I think this is the best pizza this Texan has ever had. If you are close here get a pizza and you will not regret it.' u'Sicilian pizza awesome! Canoli the best!\nRibeye kapow!! Great place. Awesome service. Great staff.' u'We came here for "second dinner" on our "eat too much while in NYC" tour.  \n\nIt was late so we were seated immediately.   There was a little bit of lag time to order but once that was over we had quick and great service. \n\nWe shared a rigatoni and vodka and a veal parmesan hero.   The pasta was good but nothing exceptional.   The pasta was cooked great though.   The veal hero was excellent.   Best parm sandwich we\'ve had. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place.' u'Came here for dinner before a show and my wife and I really enjoyed both dishes we ordered. \n\nThe ceasar saled was solid but my lasagne was really delicious.  Just the right amount of meat and cheese and the flavor was terrific. My wife had the split pea soup and was really happy with her choice.  The free garlic bread was simple but pleasantly garlic-y. \n\nGreat location and mostly attentive staff.  \n\nThe only negative was that we ordered a salad I told the waiter that we wanted to split it. When the server delivered the salad it came only on one plate and I again mentioned that we wanted to split it.  A few minutes goes by (and the place was pretty empty) no extra plate. Since I don\'t want to eat the salad "hockey-style" (sliding it back and forth) nor reach across the table for every bite orangutan-style I asked again for the plate.  Yeah now I can start eating!' u"Love the place and that's before I even ate anything!  Not elegant or trendy.  Old school friendly neighborhood NYC ambiance.   Everyone seems to know everyone although I did come in late.   Food is delicious with generous portions.   Sauces are substantial...not delicate.  And the food is the kind my mother would make.... if she was Italian!    I'm definitely coming back when I come back to NYC." u'Fantastic Italian place not too far from Time Square. Everyone loved all of our choices from the fettuccini to the Pizza to the Veal. Would definitely recommend and while be a spot we will absolutely hit when we return to NYC.' u"The food here is AMAZING but I'm giving it 4 stars because I was a little disappointed in the calamari and tiramisu. They were just okayyy and I probably won't order those again. However the main dishes here are GOOD! \n\nWe got the cheese ravioli and penne a la vodka to share among three people and we all loved it! The ravioli was so fresh! You can honestly taste the fresh cheese inside and I will definitely be coming back for this entree! The vodka sauce was very unique. It was not thick or heavy at all! It was light and flavorful and all of the penne was covered with it - just the right amount! \n\nAlso the staff here is great! Every waiter/waitress came over at least once asking us if we needed anything/etc. They were so friendly and so genuine and always smiling! \n\nI will definitely be coming back here and highly recommend this place to all!!" u'Don\'t believe the hype.  This place is overpriced and mediocre.  Be forewarned:  the "garlic knots" are simply biscuits with garlic thrown on them.  Absolutely disgusting!  We sent the knots back and we were still charged for them.  The waiter didn\'t even acknowledge our displeasure with the quality.  We will NOT be returning!!' u"I usually stay at the same hotel in Manhattan during my yearly visits I had walked past this restaurant many times before trying it for the first time last year.  Oh boy I didn't know what I was missing!  \n\nConveniently the hotel (The Belvedere) has a direct line from the in room phone for you to order from this place.  There is a menu in the room but a more extensive one available online.\n\nBoth times (last year and this one) I ordered pizza for delivery both times I was very happy with the service portions and quality of the food.  Their pizzas are huge (we ordered a large) which is a very common thing in NYC. They will also make it however you like choose your crust sauce and toppings.  Very reasonably priced they include toppings like Parmesan cheese dried chilli peppers and herbs on the side for you to add nice touch.\n\nI also ate breakfast here during my visit in February 2017 was pleasantly surprised with the meal.  The place wasn't overly busy you could hear yourself talk the breakfast was relatively cheap for NYC standards and came quick and fresh.  Really great service as well.\n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer." u'Really good pizza in the theater district so it\'s the perfect stop after a show. \n\nWhat I really love about this place is that they have an extensive menu that is very similar to your typical pizza joint. And: the prices are not bad for NYC. Sure a large pie will run you over $25 if you get toppings...but you can get sandwiches calzones and other dishes for under $12 and they are large portions. The pizza is just pure delicious bliss. Very large slices but they are thin so it\'s not too ridiculous that they are large. My husband and I ordered the large (20 inch) pie and our waitress asked "You do know our large pie is very large right?" Oh we knew. And we finished it all. We told her! (Hehe)\n\nNegatives: quite crowded expect to be jostled as waitstaff and patrons squeeze past you. Also: my husband and I did not get a complimentary basket of garlic bread!!!! Everyone near us got some. Not us! For the record we didn\'t actually WANT the bread as we have a distaste for garlic on date night ;) however the fact that we didn\'t get it was odd. Perhaps they thought our 20-inch pie was simply too much carbs for one night and they decided to spare us. \n\nBe sure to make reservations if you plan on going during a typical peak time. You can make them online. Easy peasy.' u'Came to this place with my family (wife and 2 kids 13 and 10).  We were looking for a simple NY style pizza place and this place was rated high. We order a large plain pizza for all of us.   Fantastic!  Great flavor! Good blend of crispy and chewy. Really big (20 inch) pie. Love it!' u'Really great  experience - awesome service - we came in around 6:30pm on a Thursday - got a table right away.  Brilliant for this area of town plus near all the Theaters.  We order house Chanti - I liked it very much - the antipasto salad & medium (which was really large for us)  pizza.  Everything was wonderful - will be back soon to try the pastas - all in all - nice family friendly Italian spot.' u'Great pie for a quick lunch and nice cool restaurant to take a break from morning sight seeing.' u"We enjoyed our visit on a Friday night. Thought we may have to wait a while as it was 7:30 on a Friday but we only had to wait about 5 minutes. We were seated VERY close to the table next to us. I ordered lasagna and it was very good some of the best I've ever had. Good service and quick too!" u'I love love love this place.  I had forgotten how great it was until coming back after over a year. The atmosphere is fantastic the waitstaff is super attentive & the food is AMAZING (especially the Grandma pie & blueberry martini).  Highly recommend!' u'Visiting from Richmond Va with less than 24 hours in the city we took a chance with no dinner reservations and were able to be seated with no waiting.  From the moment we walked in until we left we felt like we were part of the family. I think another trip to NYC just for the lasagna here may be in order soon it\'s the best I have ever tasted and I made sure to let the owner know that on our way out. Eveything tastes like and is clearly homemade and fresh. Where in NYC do you get called "girls" by the owner and told by your waitor that "it was an honor to serve you"?!  If we had one more day in NY we absolutely would have been right back for more and to try the pizza. We loved everything about this place the service  ambiance  cocktails food it was wonderful.' u"If I was just basing this review on my lasagna it would definitely be 5 stars. But I am not I am basing it on the entire experience/meal. \n\nGarlic bread does come as a free starter but even with the garlic the bread tasted very plain and bland. We ordered the montepulciano red wine and it does not taste like it's worth 8$ a glass more like a bottle of bottom shelf wine. I had the lasagna which was really good. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana. The potatoes were not seasoned at all (only came with 4 potato pieces) and there was minimal veggies. \n\nI would come back for the lasagna maybe take out or delivery and stay at home with a nice glass of wine and bread."],0.4215,0.113,0.887,0.0
93.Pokéworks,[u"We ate here around 4pm on Saturday. I was surprised at how empty the place was. Apparently they were out of burritos. Most people seemed to be coming here specifically for that. So there was a lot of in and out going on. \n\nThere are a total of 5 stools for seating. So unless you are alone odds are you will have to take your food to go. This is NOT a sit down restaurant. I came here with my fianc\xe9. We were lucky enough to snag two seats. But they were right next to the self serve drink station so it wasn't ideal. Next time we will plan to take our food to go. \n\nWe both ordered Hawaiian Classic poke bowls. I ordered a regular. My fianc\xe9 ordered a large (for about $3 more). Honestly we couldn't tell the difference between the two other than that mine had an R on the lid and his had an L. lol  I wouldn't waste your money on the large. The regular will certainly fill you up!\n\nThe fish was fresh and the texture of the dish was very pleasant. You have a choice of rice (white or brown) and sauce (light medium or heavy).\n I chose medium. It turned out well not too wet and not too dry. I also added avocado (I think is was $1.50 more). \n\nFor those of you who have yet to try poke I would describe it as deconstructed sushi.  I've had my fair share and would say this is a solid choice. If there was a location close to my home this would definitely be in our regular take out rotation. The portion size here was a lot more filling than most others I've tried. \n\nI considered taking off one star for the lack of seating but I decided this really should be considered a take out joint. So 5 stars it is. I'll be back!" u"I am a fan of Pokeworks at Union Square so I thought I'd check out a location closer to me. We got there around 6:30-7pmpm and it actually looked like the staff was starting to pack up even though they don't close until 9pm. It was hard to get the staff's attention when we were ready to order and didn't necessarily listen closely to what toppings were ordered.\n\nOverall it was an okay experience maybe a fluke for this location. I'd definitely recommend Pokeworks and I would give this location another try." u"These lines are ridiculous! If you have a long lunch break or come here on the weekend then its worth it. The line usually piles and stretches as far as two shops away. \n\nOnce you get in its a magical experience. You pick two types of meats I would recommend the spicy tuna and the salmon yumm! And get all the free toppings. \n\nIf you're claustrophobic this restaurant may not be for you as its super tiny and crowded. The staff is super nice and explains everything that you can get if needed. \n\nDef check it out and I would say the line is worth it." u'Wherever I go for pok\xe9 I always feel like it never tops Pok\xe9works. Their bowls are simple yet flavorful and I am never disappointed when I order from here. There always seems to be a line but it moves quickly. Obviously seating is an issue but you can walk a block away for some outdoor seating. There is always a good portion of protein in their food as well!' u"3.5\n\nIt makes sense why Pokeworks as almost 1.5k reviews and still has 4 stars. The ingredients are fresh and portions are very filling. I went on Labor Day and it was packed. The regular is $10.95 and large is $13.50 - which is one more scoop of protein/raw fish and one more scoop of rice. $2.50 for another scoop of raw fish essentially - you can judge if that's worth it for you but the regular is definitely a big enough portion even for my boyfriend and especially when you try to stuff it with everything you can because why not. Here's my tip: don't add everything you can think of because when it all comes together it can be overwhelming and not mix well together. And that's kind of what happened to me - if I didn't add edamame my sushi burrito might have been even more delicious. \n\nIt's really frustrating to get a sushi burrito pick it up and it starts tearing and everything starts to fall out simply because the knife didn't cut the seaweed and brown paper wrapper all the way through. Then while balancing the half sushi burrito in one hand trying to rip the uncut part away with another hand. It literally ruined the beginning of my sushi burrito experience here. \n\nIf I'm ever in the area again I may be back but with all the poke places popping up around NYC it's not worth a trek. There's a park by Macy's with chairs and tables that you can eat at! Pokeworks only has about five high stool seats along the wall so don't count on eating inside." u'Meh as the place got more hyped I feel like the quality has gotten worse. I actually stopped coming here because of my last few bad experiences.\nAs said in my review before their portions are way smaller now. Not only that but there were two times where I got bad fish. It was so fishy that I actually had to throw the whole bowl out. You could tell the fish was not fresh!' u'Really tasty poke the line moved quickly during lunch hour. Reasonably priced for excellent quality- super fresh ingredients! Definitely good for take-out a bit cramped for dine in.' u"Now that I've moved to such a poke saturated place I'm super excited to eat lots of poke in the next few months for the sake of... *ahem* research. \n\nMy order: Regular make-your-own poke bowl with white rice salmon (x2) cucumber diced mango hijiki seaweed ogo seaweed umami shoyu sauce and topped with crab salad seaweed salad masago avocado (+$1.50) and shredded nori\n\nPrice:\nRegular poke bowl (2 proteins) - $10.95\nLarge poke bowl (3 proteins) - $13.50\n\nSpace:\nThis Pokeworks is TINY! I had some extra time to kill and was hoping to sit and leisurely enjoy my poke but there is only one small hightop along the wall by the entrance for sitting. It only fits probably 6 people at most.\n\nWhat sets it apart?\n+ I like that after you choose your base protein vegetable fixings (i.e. cucumber) and sauce they mix it all together before adding on toppings as opposed to merely squeezing the sauce on top of everything. This really helps saturates everything in flavor to make it extra tasty (though I'll probably ask for less sauce next time)!\n\n+ They have some unique proteins such as scallops shrimp and chicken (all sous vide).\n\n+ This seems to be quite a popular poke place and has had a fairly long line both times I've been there so far.\n\nAdditional notes: The last time I tried to come here on a Tuesday around 7 pm and they were out of both avocado and seaweed salad. Luckily I overheard them telling a customer as I walked in so I wasn't committed to ordering a bowl yet." u"If you want good poke' go here! I swear this place ruined it for me into going to other poke spots. It's great quality and better toppings! \n\nThe place is really small you can't really dine in. It's more of a grab n go type of a place. But they do have about only 4 or 5 stools to sit and eat at. You can build your own bowl or order straight from the special menu. My favorite is the ahi tuna and salmon. My favorite sauce is the umami shoyu and the siracha aioli. Perfect mix together. And that siracha gives it a perfect spice to it. They also have my favorite topping which is the garlic chips. It adds that crunch texture to it and goes well with the raw fish. Unlike most poke places I've been to this place doesn't have that fishy taste. I could eat their bowls all day! So sad we don't have one where we live." u'Ever since I came back from Hawaii back in December 2016 I only get Hawaiian classic salad bowl my favorite!\nI don\'t come here as often as I used to when I first discovered this awesome spot but I still come whenever I am around.\nThere may be a few new people working and I\'ve had a slight incident the very last time I was here (7days ago) and again today..........\n\n.........when I asked for cilantro he said "we don\'t have it" I asked again and he said the same thing "we don\'t have it" I didn\'t understand him why he kept saying they didn\'t have it when it\'s on the menu board. is it me? he finally said they did not have it they are out of it. OMG he could\'ve SIMPLY said "we are out of cilantro" i want to take it back I said "I\'m sorry" cuz I\'m not. I don\'t care if it was me should\'ve said it "OUT OF IT" instead "DONT HAVE IT"\n\nMy bowl was good as alway! YUM\n\nOh yes I do want to mention it the last time last Thursday 7 days ago October 5th My friend wanted chicken but the girl said I\'m sorry we are out of chicken today. Well said.' u"This was one of the best poke bowls I have had in the city. I did the create your own with two proteins (salmon and tuna) for $10.50 and got the umami shoyu sauce which was absolutely delicious. Tempted to try the other sauces but the umami shoyu was so good that I don't know I'll be able to resist it again! I also loved how many different seaweed topping options they had - I love seaweed so I got them all.\n\nNot much seating inside but great to grab a bowl to go!" u"Love this Pok\xe9 place so much! \n\nPokeworks has their signature bowls but I preferred to select all dressings by myself. I've tried both Poke bowl and Poke noodles and they are all perfect! The dressings are all fresh and tasty. I love Ahi Tuna Salmon. Seaweek salad crab salad diced mango seaweed crispy opinions...etc..The classic Pokeworks sauce tastes so good!! I think it's the one of the best Pok\xe9 I've tried recently. Love it!" u"The shop is very small but it's set up well. It was pretty crowded when I went in around 5pm. There's about four barstools as far as seating goes no open seating when I visited. They're pretty close to Bryant Park though so that's not a huge deal. \n\nThey were out of a lot of proteins they didn't have the shrimp the girl in front of me ordered and they didn't have the fish I wanted but I got an alternative. Everyone who worked there seemed very disinterested in the customers saying the shortest response possible. For instance when they told me they were out of the fish I wanted they didn't offer me an alternative just stared at me until I picked something. So that wasn't great. \n\nThe prep area looked clean and there were a lot of employees but none of them really seemed to be doing anything. Price was about what I expected $11.50 for one of the signature bowls. \n\nThe food was good but not great nothing special about any of it. I did enjoy it but I probably won't gonna back. Lots of other poke places to try in the city." u'Excellent poke bowl the fish was fresh and flavor full! The portion was extremely generous as well as the people working at the place. Def worth a trying out.' u'This is my first time I ever came to pokeworks. My friend & I have been trying to eat here for a while but just never had the time to. We finally had time to come here and boy that sushi burrito gave us life. The amount of toppings that was given to us was very filling! And the staff was really helpful and nice. Will definitely come back if I get the chance to!' u"This is the first place I ever tried pok\xe9 and I picked it for an office lunch so it was actually the first time that most of us had ever had pok\xe9. Potentially risky to try something new for a work lunch but ultimately very worth it. We have all gone back since and enjoy pok\xe9 when we can. Always good to load up on healthy toppings. The drinks that they make (not the canned drinks) are a little bland and the line is generally long if you don't get there early. Worth the wait generally and very satisfying." u'Pokeworks "I choose you"... (Reference to Pokemon in case you were wondering) \n\nI\'ve only been in NYC for little over 3 weeks and I already have repeat cravings for their amazing poke bowls! \n\nAlthough they have pre-set options I love their choose your own adventure (not what it\'s actually called) poke bowls. First you choose the base rice/brown rice/quinoa/salad/wrap. Then you move on to the good stuff.... TOPPINGS!!\n\nThe service is quick and the food is fresh! I know a lot of poke shops have popped up since its opening but Pokeworks is still one of my go to favorites!' u"AMAZING!!!\n\nI am ADDICTED to this place!!!\n\nI always get the regular bowl with ahi tuna and salmon. The fish is super fresh! The mix-ins plenty and the the sauces incredibly yummy. I work on 33rd between 9th and 10th but I don't mind walking over just for PokeWorks!\n\nThe line could seem daunting but the staff have a system that seems to move the line quickly. They also have lots of staff working the lunchtime rush which is also a huge bonus. Another bonus the loyalty card; people might be put off by the price but it's comparable to most midtown prices; the loyalty card helps anyone's reservation about pricing." u"Food was decent ingredients definitely could have been fresher. They were out of a lot items so I had a limited choice of things to try. Staff is extremely rude though. \n\nAfter hearing about the pok\xe9 craze for a while I finally decided to stop by and try this place. I was super excited to see that there wasn't a line on a Friday afternoon (it was actually completely empty). Even though I explained to each worker at every step that it was my first time eating here and that I was unaware of how the whole process worked they were extremely rude and rushed me through the whole process even though there was no one there! While making my bowl the worker stopped to complain to her coworker about how ready she was to go on break and wouldn't explain to me what items were what when I'd ask. I'll give a different location a try but I probably won't come back to this one anytime soon." u"This place is close to my office so I often end up here to pick up dinner on my way home after work. I usually come around 5:30-6:30PM and haven't had to deal with much of a line. I am not sure how the lunch rush is however. The first time I came they had the music playing so loud that I could not for the life of me hear what the workers were asking me. I'm pretty sure they also could not hear me as I asked  for salmon and shrimp and ended up with salmon and tuna. Haven't had that problem any other time though. Anyway I get the regular size and customize my own bowl and its enough to satisfy my stomach for a meal without feeling overly full."],0.3879,0.118,0.828,0.054
77.The Kati Roll Company,[u'Really enjoyed my two rolls.  I\'m visiting NY and wanted "something" but wasn\'t sure where to go that was close. I had checked Yelp for a foot spa close to my hotel and saw Kati Roll on the map right next to the foot spa.  I checked yelp reviews on Kati Roll and decided to try it.  SO GLAD I DID!\n\nI agree with the reviewer who stated get one for a snack two for a meal.  I got the chicken tikka roll and the shrimp masala roll. Both were delicious!  Very flavorful with a mildly spicy. I loved the herbed sauce they put on the rolls.   My Shrimp Roll has 8-10 decent sized shrimp in it!  The chicken was a tad over cooked; but the shrimp was right-on! Shrimp was tender and pink. I was quite pleased. \n\nI rounded out my meal with a masala chai tea. I had to chuckle after tasting the tea because the cashier told me where the sugar was if I wanted it when he handed me the tea. I thought "Why would I put sugar in chai tea? ... ok thanks ".  Come to discover chai tea I\'ve had in the past has been pre-sweetened!  Hahaha ... yes I got up to get two sugar packets. \n\nOh the atmosphere is actually pretty cool. I loved the old Bollywood movie posters on the walls. \n\nI highly recommend this place!' u"Their rolls are good but so far none of them have blown my mind. You really need to eat two of them to feel you've eaten a proper meal so it can get expensive. The vegetarian kati rolls are less expensive but you're still paying $6 for a single roll which I think is a bit much. If you go way uptown you can get better and cheaper ones at Roti Roll Bombay Frankie but obviously that's pretty far away. I'm in Midtown a lot so it's very convenient.\n\nI've tried the Achari Paneer and the Mixed Veggie Rolls and they're pretty good. I love going to any kind of Indian restaurant because there are always plenty of vegetarian options. The kati rolls are filled with a decent amount of filling and they're flavorful and moist. It's not like sitting down and enjoying a hot curry with roti but it's a decent substitute for those of us in a hurry. Even when they're busy the food comes out pretty fast and I really appreciate that." u"I have been waiting and wanting to try Kati Roll company for such a long time.\nThe boyfriend and I brought got two rolls each. Each roll is about 6 -9 dollars - depending on which one you're getting.\nOverall it's okay I got one chicken one and one beef ( I believe) and I couldn't really tell the differences. They were generally okay and I love me a crispy paratha but .... it wasn't crispy. \nBut it's a cute idea - to have south asian food on the go kinda thing. \n\nBut I think I'll go to Jackson's Height to get me some South Asian food. Sorry." u'Veggie or non -veggie their rolls are to die for !! Reminds me of all the Indian spots !! Got the achari paneer roll and lamb sheekh roll ! So yummy and decent pricing like about $5.85 each !' u'This is one of our favorite spot when we are in the city. The best thing is they have few locations throughout Manhattan and food is quiet consistent. \n\nI would highly recommend when ordering any Kati Roll to order with their Speical Ginger Ale ... It gives that nice kick to the flavor  :p' u"(3.5) \n\nUpdating my review - last three months have had the rolls pretty regularly and noticed one key change - while the taste of the filling remains similar the paratha has become increasingly greasy. My guess is they are churning them out quickly and to keep the pace are adding a lot more oil to hasten the process. As it stands you end up feeling heavy and really full after one roll... and are left with an oily taste in the mouth. Not fun. They used to have a lighter 'roti' option... but don't seem to advocating it much and takes much longer for the order to deliver too. Paneer chicken tikka and aaloo are still my favorites - Chana has a strong taste of cardamom which I'm not a fan of." u"I've had Kati Rolls on my earlier visit too to New York but somehow never got around to writing a review.  \n\nIt's a casual spot with not much seating area.  Basically it's a take out joint.  Service is very fast.  They specialize only in Katis and they make them well.  There are options for vegetarians and meat lovers.  I tired 1 paneer and 1 chicken roll.  There was option to go with egg parantha but I did not select that.  Chicken roll was better flavored.  But I enjoyed both.  \n\nWould definitely eat here again." u'What a great midtown lunch option! The lineup is kind of long but it moves pretty quickly.\n\nYou have lots of vegetarian and non-vegetarian places to choose from. Also this place is halal which is a major plus.\n\nI got the shami kabab roll. It was really good without being too heavy. The meat was tasty and the paratha was fresh. The only thing is that the paratha was a bit greasy which is usually expected. I think you can substitue it for roti if you want to be on the healthier side!\n\nPrice-wise you pay $6 for a roti which was filling! Not bad at all!' u"For a quick lunch spot that's something different it's good. For a go-to spot  it so much. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. The food however was just average not something I would come back for.\n\nIf you just want a light lunch get one roll. If you are hungry get at least two. I got the shrimp masala roll and the shami kabab roll. I preferred the shami kabab roll as it had more flavor and the meat was cooked well. The two rolls in total cost me $11.50. One thing I do want to point out is the chutney sauce which was really good cost extra. Normally places don't charge you for the sauce. I can see being charged the second but not the first." u"This was in my NY eateries bucket list since few years so it was a must do when in New York!  I am just wondering why they spell as Kati Rolls and not Kathi Rolls how it is spelled back in India. This place was just three blocks away from our hotel and we decided to have these rolls as our evening snacks. This place definitely didn't disappoint. It is not too pricey and they deliver too. \n\nWe ordered 3 rolls -\nAloo (Mashed and seasoned potatoes filling) and egg roll \nEgg Roll and \nPaneer ( Inidan cottage cheese) Rolls\n\nParathas were soft and Aloo filling (stuffed spicy seared potatoes) roll was the best. These were more of wheat parathas and not just white flour chewy parathas. I found the rolls authentic and tasty. Just found the oil content little high which if I ever visit again will tell them if they can reduce. I liked their cilantro and mint chutney too. Everything about the roll was how usually Kathi rolls are supposed to be. The spices were perfect and so was the egg. You can easily eat two if you are hungry. \n\nThis place is a must go if you are looking for quick snack to have at anytime of the day." u"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS AND INEXPENSIVE! It's totally worth it. If you're looking for a snack get one but if you're looking for a meal definitely get two or three.\nI'm so happy I found this gem so close to work." u"This is a great place for grabbing a quick snack or lunch.  They make everything fresh to order.  They have a variety of meat and vegetarian options.  I had the Chana Masala roll the Unda Aloo roll and the masala chai for my beverage.  \n\nThe Unda Aloo roll is a flat paratha bread with a layer of beaten eggs and spicy mashed potato.  The Chana Masala roll is chickpeas with tomatoes and blackening spices.  I like the Unda Aloo roll more than Chana Masala; the Unda Aloo is flavorful and has the perfect amount of kick and this is coming from someone that can't eat spicy food.  The layer of eggs on the bread covering the mashed potatoes really adds an additional taste. \n\nAccording to the other yelpers a lot of people like the Chana Masala so this is all just a preferences.  I think the reason I wasn't a big fan of the Chana Masala is because the chickpeas were undercooked for my taste.  In addition it is also more spicy.  All the rolls are mildly spicy but you can request for it to be more spicy.  \n\nOverall everything is great and the cashier was wonderful. She was actually the one who recommended the Unda Aloo roll to me.  When I went back to order a drink she asked how I like the roll which I thought was really nice." u'Ordered this off seamless. There used to be no delivery fee but now they charge a $0.99 delivery fee. I have tried most of their rolls. This is my ranking of them from most favorite to least favorite:\n1) Unda Shami Roll - Shami with egg this is one of the premium rolls\nTied for 2 depending on the flavor for the week:\n2) Shrimp Masala Roll - Grilled Shrimp in coconut milk in roll\n2) Unda Beef Roll - Beef Tikka with rolled into an egg rolled into either a roti or paratha roll\n3) Unda Chicken Roll - Chicken tikka rolled into egg rolled into \n4) Unda Roll - Just the most basic roll with eggs.\n\nOverall the food arrives packaged in aluminum foil to keep it warm. They even give you wipes to wipe your hands.' u'So good!  A go to when I am working in the city!  Open late and great location. Clean and packaging is great for eating on the go. Add this to your list of places to go!' u'Kati Rolls!! What is there not to like about these? \n\nI have always liked Kati Rolls and have tried them in many different places! I usually get the unda chicken and the lamb shami.\n\nIt was my first time going to the location and they had a new flavor with goat. Ooohhh myyy goshhhh! Sooo delicious! It literally tasted like my moms home made mutton (lamb) wrapped in a chapati(Indian bread). \n\nThey serve it rolled with onions cucumber and cilantro which bring out the taste even more and give it some crunchiness. These Kati Rolls always hit the spot and are so inexpensive. You def need to get 2 to get full!' u'Well if you are craving for something Indian and done wanna go for the usual curry  try the TKRC. My personal favourite is achari aloo ( pickled potatoes ) with mango lassi! Being a veggie this is my to go place when I m near Bryant park !!' u"Honestly I've tried 3 other Kati Roll places around the city in less populated areas compared to this location and noticed a huge difference in quality of the rolls. Most likely has to do with the hustling and bustling with soooo many people walking in and out. Greater demand lower quality. \n\nBut hey if you're a tourist or really hungry after walking around quite a bit - you will love it! \n\nOr if you are a local and happen to be all over NYC every other day try out their (fairly new) location in St. Marks place. I liked the quality there best. 2nd best is the one in the West Village area." u"Had heard a lot about this place from my friends so while I was in NY decided to give it a try. I  didn't like it so much.May be i was expecting something too authentic and need to re caliber my expectations. We were 4 and we ordered couple of different varieties of roll.. The taste was bad size was small and quality I would rate a 0. Now that I know there will be no second for me... I only liked the Indian masala Chai at this place. I am not sure whether it was the 31st Dec thing or what. But my experience with all the rolls I tasted were Bad !! \n\nWe Took :\n1) Aloo Masala Roll : We took 2 of them. Seemed they had stuffed in boiled potatoes with no spices and the 1 that was spicy had crushed green chilies which was not even mashed in with the potatoes .\n2) Unda Aloo Roll: Again bland in taste !!\n3) Achari Paneer Roll: the name Achari(pickled) itself speaks about the flavor but there was no taste at all again. The paneer was too dry and was not marinated hardly any chutney or flavors.\n4)Chicken roll: Friends complained that chicken was overcooked and dry !!\n5)Mixed veggie roll- Giving 1 stars only because of this(n Chai) which was a bit good and I would say I could eat and found some flavors in it !!!\n\nThe lady who called out the Order numbers seemed too frustrated out of her job!! She was continuously yelling like anything  till the time the person picks up their orders !! (the place is small and a little shout would make it audible).\n\nI liked the way they have decorated this place with old Bollywood movie posters !!!" u"I absolutely love this place!!!!! Very tasty and delicious little rolls that's packed with flavor! The lines moves pretty fast and it's a great pick up spot for lunch/snack. My to go to roll is the paneer roll--- very filling and yummy! Their chai tea is also delicious... strong and flavorful but beware this can run out fast! So grab some while it's still early!!!" u"Soooooo happy I've finally tried Kati Roll! There is one nearby my office so I went for lunch around 12:45. Tip: Make sure you go for lunch a little early or a little late to beat the lunch rush. I probably waited about 20 minutes total waiting on line and then for my food. But the roll was sooooo worth it! I got a shrimp masala roll on the traditional fried pita ($6.95) SO CHEAP AND DELICIOUS! My boyfriend got the chicken tikka roll ($5.35) and the unda beef roll ($6.80). I tried both which were also delicious. I preferred the beef! Super satisfied thanks Kati Roll Company!"],0.8718,0.767,0.233,0.0
161.Virgil’s Real Barbecue - Times Square,[u"Virgil's never fails to deliver great food generous portions and friendly service. Even as the surrounding Times Square area has turned into a tourist zone Virgil's has kept its menu true to the principles of delicious real barbecue. On my last visit I started with the train wreck fries -- cheese fries with the works. They were delicious but the brisket that came out next was even better. The brisket has become my go-to item at Virgil's. Desserts were also amazing -- highlighted by the key lime pie.\n\nWhen I left a job (many) years ago I chose Virgil's for my going-away lunch spot. It was a festive place to bring a group and the food was enjoyed by all. More recently I have been coming to Virgil's at least once a year to get together with friends and it never disappoints. Locals and tourists alike can find a lot to like about Virgil's -- great food festive atmosphere good drink selection. I see that Virgil's has expanded into other cities more recently; if I end up in Las Vegas or at the Atlantis in the Bahamas I will definitely hit up the Virgil's there." u"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday after all the early Broadway shows started.  Walked in and was seated immediately. Staff was friendly and attentive.  \nWe started with hush puppies which were really excellent. Crispy outside soft inside and they came with maple butter which added a perfect amount of sweetness. They were a little expensive but there were a lot of them so it didn't seem outrageous. \nI had planned on ordering something smoked when we walked in but then I saw on the menu Kansas City Fried Chicken. Now some of the best fried chicken I've had in my life was at Stroud's fried chicken in Kansas City so I had to order that to see if it compared at all. The chicken was good moist and not dry at all in the breast. The breading was well seasoned and crispy.  However it just couldn't compare to what I hoped it would be. It was good chicken but in the future I'd probably stick to the BBQ.  \nQuick notes on the sides:  baked beans weren't my favorite. Very vegetal I prefer more molasses type flavored. Mac and cheese was quite good. The cornbread was okay. Kind of straddled the line between savory southern style and sweet northern style. I could be wrong but I feel like that winds up pleasing no one. I'd have liked it sweeter but the flavor was still good." u"Started a new job in the area and after dismissing this place as another over-priced cheap restaurant in Times Square I stumbled in due to bad weather and proximity to the office. And I'm seriously glad I did. They have an $8.99 lunch special that includes your choice of 1/2 smoked chicken pulled chicken or pulled pork + 2 sides and cornbread. I've gotten this twice now and have yet to be disappointed. Here's what I love:\n\n- Portion size is ridiculous in a great way though because typically in this area you're paying $20 for a small lunch plate.\n- The creamed spinach is really freaking good. \n- I also loved the mashed sweet potato. Kind of plain but in a great way that you don't feel like you're eating sugarcane (trying to be mildly healthy and low-carb). \n- The chicken has been great both in the pulled and 1/2 smoked version. They have this special white sauce for the chicken that's delicious. I don't even touch the BBQ sauce.\n- Service has been friendly and super quick. Like I can go there place an order and be out of there in less than 10 minutes.\n\nNow my expectations may have been low but I'm still particular (lived in Austin for two years) about my BBQ. Virgil's is totally capable of satisfying your craving for BBQ and it's a nice go-to for lunch options in TS. I'm not even sure why I'm docking it one star other than it didn't totally blow my mind. Definitely deserves a 4.5 star rating." u"Been here a few times but never had Yelp on the phones. Oh well out of town friends wanted to meet this was an easy midpoint. I cannot come here and not eat the hush puppies the maple butter is whipped by the LORD! My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I opted for the brisket. I did expect more on the platter but I couldn't finish it all. For sides I ordered the beans and greens. It comes with cornbread. \n\nThe kid got a grilled cheese with bacon and fries. A crab cake was ordered with rice and greens. There was also a brisket sandwich ordered. The bread was not to their liking so only the meat was eaten. Actually they had too many hush puppies and wanted to watch the carbs... Foolish\n\nAdam the server was decent and kind. Of course I'm coming back!!!!!" u"Pro's:\n\nThe portions were large\nThe mac and cheese was good\nThe mashed potatoes were not bad\nThe brisket was good\n\nCon's:\n\nThe price was a tad high\nThe gravy stunk\nThe ribs were dried out\n\nI'm not sure if i'll come here again. Between the price being quite high and the food just being meh i can find better bbq in other parts of manhattan." u'This place was recommended to me by a friend. I was thinking that there will be a long wait since this is located at the most busy place at Times Square but no we were seated immediately. Our server was very courteous and did a good job. The place is somewhat a sport bar at the gound floor and table seating in the second level. Overall this is a very cozy place to dine.\n\n We ordered "Pig out for Two" (see menu if you\'re wondering what this is) which came out to be very satisfying. In my opinion this dish will be enough for 3 people who are not really into heavy eating. Just order sides that will complement your taste with BBQ.' u"I came here absolutely starving so it shouldn't have taken much to please me. Sadly everything was a disappointment. The waitress was shy yet attentive. The drinks are decent. I had a watermelon margarita and pina colada. The fried pickles are sweet which I think they should state on the menu or have the waiter tell you. The remoulade sauce served with it wasn't anything special. I ordered pulled pork trash ribs mashed potato and Mac and cheese. The cornbread didn't have much taste. The potatoes were good--they have mushrooms. The pulled pork is dry and tasteless and the BBQ sauce at the table didn't help. Mac n cheese was very mediocre. I could've kept it if I had something good to eat it with. The trash ribs taste boiled in tomato sauce. They are tender but taste like something you get in a first grade cafeteria. No seasoning smoke or BBQ flavor. Not edible at all. The manager came and said they saut\xe9ed it after BBQ. Why would you do that? \nI sent it back and got the smoked wings and popcorn shrimp instead. Who could mess that up? \nFor $15 you get a few shrimp on top of an entire bag of popcorn. The shrimp isn't seasoned and neither is the batter. So tasteless I didn't even want it. It came with the same bland remoulade the pickles came with. The smoked wings were the only edible thing I got and they were just ok. I won't return." u'OMG! This place NEVER disappoints! Once again they hit it out of the park!\n\nSo down in the city on 05/27/17 to catch a show and have some fun my guest and I ended up here for dinner after another restaurant had a two hour wait (sorry Sardi\'s) Now I did not choose Virgil\'s originally as I have been here EVERY time I have been to the city for the past three years so I was going to change it up but why tamper with perfection. \n\nFirst of all the staff is always great always kind always helpful. When advised of the two hour wait at 5:00pm I called Virgil\'s who said there was only a 20 minute wait there and left our name sat at the bar and they were ready to seat us before the drinks were even finished. The drinks... Oh My the drinks.. my usual choice for Virgil\'s is there bloody mary (grey goose) because they make a mean one and this was no let down and my guest ordered a frozen hurricane... we were both in happy places. \n\nSitting down to order we decided to forgo an appetizer because I know how much food they really bring you so I did get the special soup of the day which was a chicken poblano pepper soup which was SO tasty with a bit of heat. For dinner my guest decided to try their grilled catfish (she had never had catfish before) and I went for their "Pick Two" combination platter and chose their Memphis Style Pork Spare Ribs and Sliced Texas Beef Brisket. We both opted for the same sides of Collard Greens and Macaroni and Cheese. As I am writing this review my mouth is beginning to salivate in memory of that meal. It was good I mean REALLY good and you cannot imagine the portions you are provided for the price and the location. \n\nThere was only one hic-cup which was immediately taken care of some how my guests order was either misentered or misfired and she was brought grilled chicken instead of grilled catfish but within minutes (less than 5) it was corrected. My only question when we left was which way was Grand Central Station and can someone carry us there. \n\nLesson learned always go to Virgil\'s' u'Where has Virgil\'s BBQ restaurant been all of my life?  Do you know how many times that I have been to New York City?  I never even heard of this restaurant until a friend recommended it while we were in New York for a recent visit.  I couldn\'t believe just how great the food was.  The portions were Fred Flintstone size and delicious!  \n\nWe were starving by the time that we arrived at the restaurant and on the way to the restaurant a young man handed me a coupon for a free drink or free Trainwreck fries.(Hand-cut fries covered with melted cheddar and jack cheese smoked bacon scallions and pickled jalapenos with ranch dressing)  Yippee Skippee!  I opted for the frozen drink.  Tasty!  \n\nWe were going to order an appetizer but after looking at several of the plates we decided that if we ordered appetizers we wouldn\'t be able to eat our entrees. So order we did - I ordered the House Smoked Bbq Classics with Memphis Smoked Pork Spare Ribs Smoked BBQ Chicken collard greens and Pecan Rice.  My sister ordered the daily special of apricot glazed baby back ribs baked beans and collard greens.  My niece ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Mississippi Catfish Fillet Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and Mac And Cheese.  My daughter Muff actually ordered the Grilled Chicken Southern Caesar Salad with Romaine lettuce Virgil\'s Original Biscuit Croutons Jalapeno-Roasted Corn Salsa and Marinated Grilled Chicken Breast. (Who orders a salad at a BBQ restaurant???  My child that\'s who!)\n\n I usually opt for rice over potatoes and I was not disappointed with the pecan rice.   Chunks of smoked sausage bacon red and green peppers.  Yummy! (I don\'t even like peppers but I loved this rice!)  Totally tasty!  And the collard greens?  I swear that someone\'s southern grandma was back in the kitchen cooking up those greens saying "Wrench around there and hand me that ham hock!"  And my ribs and chicken were delightful(Smoke rings showed up and showed off) as well as the catfish and grilled chicken Caesar salad that I tasted from other plates. (Hee hee hee!)  And that corn muffin was tasty too!\n\nMy only complaint was that we waited an eternity to have our orders taken and I was initially given all ribs and not ribs and chicken.  Other than that it was just a totally craveble meal!' u"Wonderful food/ we walked in and were immediately greeted with warm smiles and hickory smoke. We sat close to the window to allow passerby's to see the delectable goodness we were about to devour. I had the burnt ends sandwich with fries and my fianc\xe9 had the chicken po boy with chicken and rice soup. The chicken po boy was off the lunch menu and was definitely po in size; but the burnt ends sandwich made up for short stature of the po boy.  The burnt ends sandwich isn't on the menu and should be-it's a great sandwich definitely filling with loads of flavor. For an appetizer we had the bar b que Virgil wings. A hint of spice and loads of smoke flavor from the hickory wood. Great place to eat as many can attest to." u'Virgils BBQ is one of the best BBQ places I\'ve eaten at in NYC even though in a touristy area in Times Square it\'s an amazing BBQ joint. In this visit my first visit that I\'m actually reviewing. We started off with two appetizers the "trash ribs" and the off menu Biscuits and gravy which is by far the best thing I\'ve eaten in life and will probably be my last meal if I was ever on death row. The biscuits and gravy is just amazing flavorful white sausage gravy over buttery soft buttermilk biscuits if I could marry the biscuits I would. The trash ribs are smaller cuts of the spare ribs cooked in their amazing sauce. The meat just like every other meat at Virgils falls off the bone with a lovely tangy sauce its jug a delightful way to start off a meal.\n\nAs for entrees we had the pulled chicken sandwich two of those at the table which actually was really flavorful and I\'m not the biggest pulled chicken fan. \n\nAs for my entree I had the pick three simply because I\'ve had them all and couldn\'t decide. I had the spare ribs beef brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork had amazing porky flavor with all the fat simply cooked down and melted into the tender meat. Literally no sauce required. The spare ribs fall of the bone tender with great smoke flavor and again no sauce require the sauce would be just an add on to help you reach BBQ nirvana. Lastly my favorite the beef brisket with it\'s beautiful\nSmoke ring and smokey beefy flavor the meat literally falls apart with the touch of a fork. It\'s an amazing piece of perfectly cooked meat. \n\nVirgils is a place I would go to over and over again and will continue to go to.' u"The smoked bbq wings are good and a nice portion. I ordered the fried chicken too salty with collards and mash and they were ok. But I wouldn't come back. Nothing unique or memorable about the food here." u"My son and I went to a concert the other night at the Playstation Theatre. Lots of dining options in the area. What to do? We are big BBQ fans and Virgil's was a block away from the venue. Always wanted to try the place. So we made a reservation and looked forward to good evening of righteous BBQ and music.\n\nWe showed up at 6 pm and were seated promptly upstairs. David took care of us. Nice guy. Interested in what brought us into NYC. Great service. No hovering. No hokey chit chat. Just a good guy who cares about the customer.\n\nWe split an order of popcorn shrimp. The shrimp was served on top of some really tasty popcorn in a paper bag. Nice! For mains we both had the same thing-Memphis style ribs with fries. I ordered some beans also. So how were the ribs? My son received a plateful of thick juicy ribs. I received a plateful of thin ribs with lots of inedible flap meat and dried out scraps from the end of the rack. I ate one rib and said to myself what the heck am I doing? So I sent them back after asking Dave to compare the ribs on both plates. My dinner was cheerfully and quickly replaced. Unfortunately what arrived wasn't much better than what was on the first plate. Dry with annying big hunks of inedible flap/membrane. Sorry but I refuse to eat ribs with a knife and fork. So I left a big pile of the inedible bits. Feh....\n\nBeans cornbread and fries were excellent. The BBQ sauce was just ok.\n\nAlthough my son enjoyed his ribs he remarked that Brother Jimmy's does it better. I agree.\n\nGreat location excellent service-thanks David! but inconsistant product. Not sure we will be back." u'So happy hour is everyday non -fri from 3-6 !!! So off the back that made me feel really good !! Unith the bartender was welcoming and knew exactly how to keep me entertained .the  food was amazing and the taste was so southern !!! I love the atmosphere and how everyone helped each other out' u"Went there for happy hour after work. \nStandard American bar with pretty standard happy hour prices.\nHad poor selection of beers... Coronas and Modelo and a poor selection of mixed drinks.\nThe fries and nachos were pretty good tho but you'd rather go to Jimmy's Corner" u"My mom really wanted to eat here on our recent trip to NYC. We had a pretty good experience. We made a reservation on Open Table and only had to wait a few minutes after arriving to be seated.\n\nWe ordered BBQ pork nachos to start. They were 'meh'. The BBQ sauce on the pork was overwhelming and kind of ruined them for me. My mom and I split a platter with brisket pulled pork and spare ribs. All of the meat was delicious! We had Mac and cheese and French fries as our sides. Both were tasty. I was not impressed with the corn bread which is one of my favorite things to eat with BBQ. It was dry and didn't have much flavor.\n\nMy nieces both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Huge portion of meat on the sandwich. They both gave it two thumbs up.\n\nI probably won't be back here for a few years but nothing to do with the food quality or service. There are just so many places to eat in NYC." u"I am writing to all the parents who have more than 2 children and are visiting New York.  Are you tired?  Do you want to sit down?  Have you walked your kids over 9 miles?   Are the crowds too ferocious at Shake Shack to get a seat?  \n\nVirgil's takes reservations.  See Open Table.  You can sit down with your kids.  They have kid friendly food:  burgers grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese.  The kid meals are about $8 or $9.  I was running kids up and down the steps to the bathroom so my husband handled the kid food.  The pricing may be off a tad in my recollection. And it is New York. $9 sounds right.  \n\nThat reminds me.  The bathroom is upstairs.  You might want to sit up there if your kids need to frequently use the bathroom.\n\nAs for the grown up food I had the brisket!  It was delicious!  The potato salad was also good.  My husband had the chicken wings.  They were spicy which is his thing.  \n\nThe salad however was really small for $8.  I expected more.\n\nOverall we will be back with the kids.  It was a good option for them.  I liked not fighting for a chair and that the kids agreed to eat the food.  The food was pretty good!" u"Last day in New York and decided to go to Virgil's. I went for the first time last year and did not like this place. This time around I was hoping I was wrong.  Unfortunately they did not prove me wrong. The restaurant is huge so you'll never have issues with finding a table.  There's 2 levels.  The restaurant decor was cool and very laid back.  We ordered the set menu for 2. We picked grilled vegetables and Mac and cheese for our sides. The shared platter consisted of pork ribs beef briskets half a chicken and pulled pork. It was a lot of food!! We were flying back that night so we didn't pack the leftover to go and I felt bad that I was wasting food. The food was dry and tasteless. Only item I enjoyed was the beer batter onion rings it was delicious.  The portion size was huge. My pina colada was too sweet I didn't like it. I would not be trying this restaurant for the third time. However I gave it 2 stars for the service our waitress was amazing.  But the food on the other hand was not so amazing." u"We recently visited NYC from Ft. Lauderdale for a family birthday dinner for 18 people at Virgil's last weekend. It was an amazing dining experience. I planned everything by email with July who is their catering manager. He was delightful super helpful and accommodating. Carolyn and Chris attended to our large group with great care and attention. The food was DELICIOUS probably the best wings EVER! The portions were huge and a very good value especially for NYC.\nI would HIGHLY recommend Virgil's for fun family dining great for large groups who want to enjoy their DELICIOUS BBQ and great margaritas!!!!" u"Food: 3.5/5.0\nService: 3.0/5.0\nValue: 3.0/5.0\nDecor: 3.0/5.0\nOverall: 3.5/5.0 \n\nVirgil's seems to be one of the better [if not best] BBQ options in midtown.  I'm not as impressed by the sides or brisket but the ribs are excellent."],-0.1967,0.0,0.88,0.12
71.Red Poke,[u"Red Poke is the best poke bowl place I have had on either coast.  It's a bold statement but I can't remember ever being more satisfied by a poke bowl before.\n\nRed Poke separates itself from the multitude of poke places popping up all over NYC by including Korean BBQ meats in addition to the raw fish normally associated with poke.  When I go to a poke place I tend to gravitate towards salmon since that's my favorite fish to eat raw.  To get some variety Red Poke let me add a serving of bulgolgi to my bowl.  I never realized I needed this in my life.  Each bite was a mix of the fresh oily salmon with the BBQ bulgolgi and greatly enhanced my experience.\n\nThey also let you include lots of add-ons for free.  I was slightly embarrassed since I circled almost everything but the cashier was gracious and said the best way to experience Red Poke was to get everything.  As for pricing Red Poke is very fairly priced.  For a normal sized bowl you get two protein choices in a bowl the size of a regular-sized premade salad.  For an extra $2.50 you get the large bowl which is much larger in volume and also affords you a third protein choice.  I chose beef bulgolgi and two portions of raw salmon.\n\nMake sure you include all the add-ins you want.  They add a freshness to the whole bowl.  The serrano peppers I added were simply raw sliced serrano and added an occasional hit of heat o the bowl.  And throw in some crunchy stuff too for some texture to the bowl.\n\nI added a sous vide egg for $1.50 which seemed like a good idea at the time but didn't add much to the bowl.  Next time I'll probably add avocado instead which also costs $1.50 extra.\n\nOverall a fantastic meal that I did not want to end.  I'll definitely be back.\n\nThey even have a punch card.  After buying 9 poke bowls you get a free poke bowl.  I assume that's a normal size bowl and not the large but I guess I'll find out after I go eight more times." u"I heard about Red Poke through my company's seamless website but I never thought about ordering from it. It wasn't until my friend told me that Red Poke is a solid poke spot. I decided to give it a try and got the Chef Yun's Favorite (Salmon). \n\nThe delivery did take a while to come however the wait was worthwhile. The portions are huge for the price and it was very fresh! The flavors went really well together. They used some sort of mayo based sauce I believe and it was heavenly. I would definitely order from here again!" u"Located in Hell's Kitchen. Very open and spacious set-up. There's a laminated menu that you circle your order own. There are pre-made bowls and make-your-own. The portions (medium and large sizes) are huge!! \n\nOrdered a large make-your-own. 3 proteins: salmon shrimp and tuna. Order unlimited mix-ins at no additional cost and toppings (some have extra cost). There's a choice of sauces but not too many details as to what they are. \n\nTasted fresh and was very filling. Flavor depends on what you make it! A bit more on the pricey side but understandable for poke." u"Just might be the best poke place I've been to yet in NYC!\n\nMy fiance and I were searching for some grub prior to a Broadway show and we stumbled upon Red Poke. Little did I know but I actually had Red Poke bookmarked on my Yelp profile and now I know for good reason. The poke here was fresh filling and delicious!\n\nWe strolled in on a Friday evening at around 6pm and there was a steady stream of customers. The spot was big with quite a few seats and tables inside. It was by far the biggest poke spot I've been to. I loved how the place was so organized clean and unlike many poke businesses this place allows for their customers to order by filling out a menu form and handing it to them. Let me just say that it's a BRILLIANT idea especially at an assembly line type of spot where lines can get ridiculously long as customers mull over what ingredients they want to include.\n\nCustomers can either order one of the signature bowls which consist of pre-determined ingredients or if you're a bit more experienced build your own custom bowl. Although it was our first time here it wasn't our first poke rodeo so we built our own bowls. For the adventurous here's the process:\n\n1. Write your name on the form\n2. Pick whether you're order is to stay or go\n3. Pick your base (rice/quinoa/greens/potatoes)\n4. Pick your size (M/L) and pick your protein (7 to choose from)\n5. Add your mix in ingredients (as many as you like!)\n6. Choose one sauce\n7. Add topping (as many as you like and most are free)\n8. Add crunch (as many as you like!)\n\nAnd that's it! You've made your poke bowl! Not rocket science.\n\nTo summarize the medium poke bowls were much bigger than we were used to at other poke spots. It was at least 1/3 of the size bigger. I added just about every mix in and topping along with tuna and salmon protein and it was absolutely delicious. It was definitely one of the best pokes I've had. To be different my fiance added bulgogi beef and jeyuk pork to hers and the meat was very fresh. Everything about the poke from the proteins to the additional ingredients were packed in and hit the spot. Also the service was excellent here. The bowls were made pretty quickly and the employees were friendly. I sensed a close camaraderie amongst the employees as they fed off of each other too.\n\nAlthough poke spots have run amok in NYC it's nice to see some places starting to perfect the process of running one. Red Poke absolutely gets it with their menu form fresh ingredients and fantastic service." u"Great place for fresh ingredients! I love this place not because it is authentic poke but because overall the flavors are great and you get a lot of bang for your buck! The service is quick the quality of the ingredients are good and the ambiance is nice and cute.  \n\n(I'm not rating it 5 stars because this is not real Poke and gives no homage to the Hawaiian culture)" u"I love Red Poke. It's one of my favorite poke bowl spots mostly because I like their Korean take on the bowls. You can definitely see the influence of Korean cuisine - from the protein choices of bulgogi beef and jeyuk pork to their sauces like kimchi aioli and (my favorite) yuja chojang - which helps them stand out in the increasingly large field of poke joints.\n\nWhile the fish options are good my go-to bowl there is the spicy pork and chicken with the yuja chojang sauce topped with pickled mustard greens and pineapple and lots of other vegetables. There are a lot of options to choose from so I really like that they give you a laminated sheet where you can circle what you want and hand it in. That means you can take your time choosing and don't get rushed down the line.\n\nWe usually get the bowls to go because we're in the neighborhood but they do have several tables to eat there. And if you do you get to hear when they celebrate people that have filled up their loyalty cards for a free bowl. (Also get the loyalty card.)" u'Was in the area so we stopped by for lunch.\n\nThey have a pretty interesting concept for ordering poke bowls - you fill out a form with what you want - hand it to the cashier and they will call your name when the bowl is ready. The only thing is that some of the menu items are not a familiar item so I would have liked to see what it was. They did have some Korean flavour options too.\n\nOverall it was really good... there are two sizes you can order - the medium was just the right size for me. \n\nInside there are a few tables you can sit and eat at which is nice. There is also a cafe inside this poke place too so you can have coffee and dessert too!' u'Great little groovy counter service poke by their design or poke by your design place. At 9th and 41st with many other yummy options to snack on. Quick delicious plus lots of delightful Bakery items' u"Five Days of Poke Lunch round 2!\nCriteria: \nFreshness\nProtein/topping/dressing options\nServices\nPricing\n\n\nJust started a new job in the Bryant Park/TSQ areas and I am on a mission to search for the best poke spots in the hood. Today I stopped by Red Poke. It is by far the best of the three i have been :)\n\nSure you will still see all the usual suspect on the protein choice mix-ins and toppings . Yet what sets Red Poke apart is that in addition to the Japanese and Hawaiian styles they have Korean- leaning protein such as bulgogi and jayuk on offer. For vegetarians they have herbed mushrooms (yum). Dressing comes with korean accents as well - yuja chojang and kimchi aioli. \n\nI chose salmon and bulgogi mixed lots of toppings. Fresh-licious!\n\nDressing I opted for the chojang . Spicy ! Hit the spot ! \n\nService was quick. They even chipped in a free cookie when I picked up the takeout :)\n\nPrice slightly cheaper than peers. But they didn't skim on portions!\n\nDef will be back!" u"Best poke bowl I've ever had! Quality of salmon was really good and I'm impressed with their spicy jeyuk pork which was on point" u"Decent poke. Not my favorite in the city but it's a good spot in this mostly-deserted part of town. I mixed tuna and salmon and got every kind of seaweed. 3.5 stars." u"I've have been to Red Poke several times now and I must say that coming here has been consistently good.  Even my son enjoys his poke bowl.\n\nWhen you come in you pick up a menu card that's laminated and you can choose a pre-designed/ signature bowl or create your own. \n\nI love the YSL which includes fresh tuna and salmon topped with spicy sauce.\n\nIf you work in the area get a loyalty card as your 10th bowl is free!" u"This is my second Poke experience (the first one was okay) so I really want to pick a good spot to give it another go. Red Poke was a great pick amongst all the poke spots available in the city. The ordering process is simple - you grab a laminated menu and a red marker to check off what you want. One side had a list of poke bowls with set ingredients and the other side was build your own. I decided to build my own since I was feeling adventurous. For base I picked brown rice and for protein I opted for half salmon and half tuna (both are raw). I picked a variety of toppings and red poke sauce (slightly sweet soy sauce with a hint of wasabi?). After checking off the menu I lined up to submit my order and pay. Within 5-7mins of paying my name was called and I got my food. \n\nThe poke bowl was delicious! The salmon and tuna was fresh and the toppings and red poke sauce complemented well. It was a myriad of flavors bursting in my mouth between the toasted seaweed edamame cilantro masago and toasted sesame. I was so satisfied with the meal I ordered another one to go for my mom to try. \n\nI'm definitely coming back to satisfy my poke cravings when I'm around the area. Service was quick and great!" u'This was my first poke experience. With all the hype you gotta try it at least once right? So with that being said I really have nothing to compare it to (like other poke places) but besides quality of the food/taste in general.\n\nI like the concept of the place. Order on a laminated sheet give it to them pay and wait. Super simple. \n\nI went with making my own bowl. Turned out pretty good in my opinion. Mind blowing crazy awesomeness? No. But two thumbs up! \n\n I think a medium size bowl will be enough for most people and this place would be great for work lunch breaks. \n\nSuper friendly staff. And the place is super clean too! \n\nUnsure about the whole poke place/cafe concept though. \n\nOh and they serve breakfast here too! Seems like they kind of do everything.\n\nBut having to try poke for the first time it does make me want to check out other places too :)' u"Not a fan of this poke joint. The sauce is really heavy and overpowers everything you have in the bowl. Further it's not very tasty as many of the mixtures are a korean twist to the usual Hawaiian dish.\n\nIt was fun to try their ordering system on the laminated menus but I think they should pick up a thing or two from the other poke places around (or even Chipotle) and have an assembly line system where people can pick out the ingredients as they see them and manage the sauce output." u'Great place for vegetarians! I got a herb mushroom quinoa bowl with cucumber edamame corn serrano peppers topped with seaweed salad an egg and pickled radishes. I asked them to put tofu in it too! For sauces I got the kimchi aoili and soy sauce on the side. But all the sauces are great and you can try them beforehand. Aside from the fresh and tasty food the friendly and quick customer service really stood out to me.' u"My husband and I've been coming here for a while. It is just amazing that they have never disappointed us. \n\nWhat differentiates their business from other Poke places in NYC?\n- Poke + Korean BBQ \n- sushi rice (white and brown rice) and quinoa options \n- kimchi and other spicy toppings & sources \n- Aesthetics of the Poke bowls \n- generous amount of fresh proteins and toppings \n- people are very polite and friendly ! And the owner couple work at the counter together with their employees. \n- the point card is a little happiness for regular customers like us: one free poke per 10 poke bowls \n\nIt is very interesting to see how efficiently they use the store serving breakfast in the morning and running a cafe in the other half of the store. They serve La Colombe coffee a variety of baked goods and cakes." u"Always in the mood for poke or anything seafood I found this place near where my sister works. She's had delivery for late work nights so this was the first time we were both dining in. Came towards the end of the lunch rush so there was a small line before we got to order. \n\nThey have these nice laminated menus where you can mark what you want or pick a pre-built bowl. I made my own and my sister got the one with tuna and salmon. They have a heavy Korean influence so if you want cooked proteins that's an option. \n\nMy sister's bowl had the creamy sauce and mine was a soy based sauce. Both were delicious and a decent sized portion for a medium. Everything was really fresh and they were generous with add ins. We did have a small wait to get our bowls but totally worth it for the quality. \n\nSpace inside is decent but with the lunch rush it might be hard to snag a spot." u"The bowls here are good however there must be some sanitation issue at this location because I had food poisoning the next day and both my brother and my friend had stomach issues early next morning.  I normally wouldn't write this review if it was just me but there were two other people who ate here at separate times and both had issues." u'Acceptable-ish.\n\nI was on the way to good eats for lunch when this place caught my eye. Clean looking place but it could definitely use a little TLC and a good wipe down on its tables and window sills. Perhaps every 15-30 minutes for the tables at least?\n\nIt\'s modern and deceptively spacious before the lunch crowd. Bottles with red tips against the window sill are for aesthetic purposes only as indicated by the nice employee manning the ordering station.\n\nOrdering is done via sharpee pen and writable laminated menu. It\'s a nice method away from the usual assembly line pace and associated stress level without losing your place in life (line hehe)..\n\nThe actual red poke namesake was ordered and the large bowl itself came out to $16.28 with tax. What I received was a bowl of sushi grade tuna chunks cut completely WITH the grain as opposed to against resulting in a tough set of tuna chunks. Delicious yes but more work for my teeth than really necessary. They\'re doing the fish an injustice even after death. This is a meat/fish faux pas everywhere!\n\nAlso they shout/team build from time to time for the stamp card redemption from customers (I think). Not quite the venue but okay.\n\nThank goodness I ordered brown rice with my bowl. I would\'ve cried if I ordered white sushi grade rice that wasn\'t prepared traditionally with rice vinegar. The brown rice was decent but not great as it wasn\'t "nutty" at all.\n\nThe price versus protein ratio is pretty abysmal as well. I left this place hungry-ish.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
40.Izakaya MEW,[u"Hidden away from the commuters and tourists around Herald Square is this gem of a Japanese restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss and the restaurant is all underground but the space is quite big once you go inside.\n\nThe decor is casual and fun. The place overall gives a very laid back vibe. We came in here on a Monday evening and there was a bit of a wait for two. We got a beer and a Moscow mule at the bar while we waited - the mule was well made and quite strong! We sat on a long table next to another couple but far enough that we got our privacy. \n\nThe food is served tapas-style good for sharing.To eat we had:\n- Kimchi Udon noodles: No wonder they're so popular they were delicious! Creamy spicy and perfectly cooked with nice big shrimp in them. Really unique and completely tasty\n- Amakara ribs: These were literally falling off the bone. Deliciously fatty and covered with a perfectly balanced sweet and spicy sauce.\n- Mew special roll: We aren't normally fans of cooked fish on sushi rolls but this was perfectly executed. The sear was just right on the salmon and the sauce topping it was creamy and delicious.\n- Mochi ice cream: We got the chocolate which was perfect and the strawberry which was nice but on the sweeter side. Loved the little forks they served it with.\n\nFood is excellent the service is attentive and the decor is fun and casual. Izakaya Mew got everything right! We will definitely be back here for happy hour or in a bigger group to try more of their excellent food." u"LOVE this place and came here numerous times. The first time I came here it was a bit hard to find;\nhowever that's definitely part of the charm that you're going somewhere hidden. This place is usually packed not only on the weekends but also on weekday nights.\n\nSince I came here so many times I've tried the tuna tartar yellowtail carpaccio tuna tataki and the salmon salad. Their raw fish is fresh and utterly delicious. Besides the raw my favorite is the omu soba. The combination of the egg noodles and meat is to die for! I also love their cocktails especially the kimitachi kiwi drink. \n\nHighly recommend for getting food and drinks with friends especially if you're in the midtown area!" u"TLDR: I wouldn't return necessarily since there are so many other restaurants out there to try. I don't regret going there. That area off of Herald Square is kind of a food desert so there weren't too many affordable eats on a Sunday. If you're not very hungry (maybe just want a snack?) looking for an affordable chill vibe with a smaller group then stop by. Get the sweet chili chicken wings and a Mew Breeze cocktail or a Kirin on draft. Don't go out of your way for it though.\n\nFull review:\nI came here for dinner this past Sunday around 6:15pm. It was surprisingly crowded for a Sunday! Beware they don't accept reservations. I would not recommend this for large groups. The biggest group I think they could seat is a party of 6. \n\nHeads up: you might need to eat at a communal table like my friend and I did. The table we were taken to technically seats 6 and they already had a family of 4 there. So we were sat awkwardly at the end of their table. I'm not into sharing my dining experience with strangers especially as a surprise. It's a little loud but they have cool decor. They're quick to take your order probably too quick. My friend and I were indecisive so it took 3 check ins before we were ready to order. \n\nThe front of the menu suggests you order a couple dishes per person to share Japanese tapas style! So we did. The dishes come out as they're ready so timing is a bit odd. My ramen came out so much faster than everything else. As for the food it was pretty bland overall. We shared the following:\n1) Sweet chili chicken wings- Best dish out of the lot! 5 big plump pieces of extra crispy chicken (some were a little burnt but I dig that!) with a nicely balanced sweet and spicy glaze. Usually sweet chili sauces tend to be overly sweet and not spicy at all but this was just right! Must try if you like wings!\n2) Shishito peppers- This surprisingly was the last item to come out! It wasn't as charred as I like. It does come with a lemon wedge so that helped. Skip!\n3) Pork katsudon- Good katsu but the rice was lacking. The rice is supposed to be smothered in a flavorful sauce but it was very bland.  Skip!\n4) Tonkotsu ramen- I wasn't expecting much from this so I set my expectations lower. It was a cold rainy night and I just wanted a big bowl of hot soup. So this did ok in a pinch. The broth could've had more complex flavors. I liked that the broth wasn't overly salty as they tend to be. There was a nice fatty slice of chashu pork and salty crunchy bamboo. The egg was insanely overcooked. It was also topped with bean sprouts scallions and I opted out of the pickled ginger.  Skip!\n5) Mew Breeze cocktail- Nice light refreshing beverage! You dangerously can't taste the alcohol! Not too sweet. Just the way I like. Smaller in size FYI. Must get!\n6) Kirin draft beer- Your standard good mild cold beer. Must get!" u"As if this place needs another stellar review...\n\nAfter 1500+ I should keep it short and sweet....TO MY CALI PEEPS:  IF YOU'RE EVER IN NEW YORK you gotta come here vegetarian or not.\n\nUNDERGROUND CASUAL SEXY AFFORDABLE.  Thursday night after happy hour this was the spot.  After about 5 or 6 appetizers beer and dessert....DRUM ROLL....ONLY $48.00!\n\nDO order the Shiso Peppers.  A fabulous pop to the meal.\nDO order the Churros.  They come with sesame ice cream and it's DELISH.\n\nThe only bummer was that they last call was around 10pm or something like that.  I mean really? I thought NYC spots were open until 2am! \n\nWith that being said...If you just have a $20 in your pocket this is your spot!" u"I haven't been in a while but the place is still rock solid. The menu has some nice additions and the service is still fast and furious so order few dishes at the time or you'll have to eat everything at once. \n\nThe wait is still long but I got lucky: at 6pm on a Friday evening I only waited 10 minutes for a table for 2. 30 minutes later the line was huge.  \n\nSalmon sashimi tacos: phenomenal. A must. \n\nMr. frank with eggplant: delicious. The meat was so tender it was melting in our mouth. \n\nYellowtail carpaccio: also very good. Thick slices of delectable goodness.  \n\nHamachi tataki (seared yellowtail): not as flavorful. The yellowtail was kinda plain. \n\nTuna tataki (seared tuna): tasty. \n\nKimchi cream udon: the kimchi back taste complements the richness of the cream. It was a great dish but don't expect a lot of shrimp... in our dish there were only 2. \n\nOmu soba: a huge potion. Not as memorable though. I wasn't s fan of the overly sweet and syrupy sauce that came with it. \n\nOverall it was a very good meal. Although it looks like a cheap restaurant dishes add up fast so expect to pay a good amount if you want to get up full." u"The ambience at the place is great despite being in the basement. There is plenty of ventalation. We arrived after 7pm on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait too long (about 30 minutes).\n\n\nGreat food and great value. Staff is very friendly. \n\nThe kimchi udon recommended by waiter was best. The clam udon also tops.\n\nWe also like the sear tuna yellow tail kumbucha  mix skewers are all great selections.\n\nThe fried octopus was good but too greasy for my taste but an order of kimchi helped cut the fatty taste.\n\nI'm definitely a fan of this place. Great food fast service and good value." u"Loved this place! I came here at around 5pm for two and was immediately seated. It was quite empty at that time. I noticed that when we left the place was packed so try to get here before 6:30 or you'll be stuck waiting.\n\nAs I walked in I was welcomed with a joyful greeting by all of the staff and was seated. I ended up getting the kimchi cream udon and the October special pork skewers. My friend got the Yaki udon. Everything was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced!\n\nI have never seen kimchi cream udon before so I was very excited for it. Definitely impressed and I am now going to be forever craving it *sigh*. I took a bite from my friends Yaki udon and it was bomb as well. They have a huge selection to choose from so I definitely want to come back to try the other dishes on their menu. \n\nStaff were very friendly and informative! I would definitely recommend the kimchi. Re udon if you want to try something new! You don't find that dish anywhere else really." u'A lively spot for small plates and drinks a group of us came by on a Saturday night.  This place doesn\'t take reservations so we had to wait forty minutes - if you\'re smart park yourself here at 6 when it\'s empty then work your way through the extensive menu. This place is BUSY but the servers don\'t rush you to vacate your table - as long as you keep ordering more. \n\nThe cocktails were inconsistent some tasted watered down some were perfect the first round then super alcohol heavy the second round - but given the rate of turnover and the busy staff it\'s not too surprising.\n\nMoscow Mewle - jamaican style ginger beer fresh squeezed lime & vodka garnished with cucumber.  This was lighter than we expected and a little on the bland side it didn\'t have the ginger kick we expected.\n\nAki No Gogo - soju red wine darjeeling tea fresh lemon peach syrup - another bland cocktail that didn\'t resonate with us.\n\nTake Me Home - tripe sec peach syrup lemon strawberries - now this was one of two highlight drinks of the night - if you like fruity cocktails stick with this one.\n\nMatcha Sparkling - japanese matcha infused vodka sparkling water lime & mint - we didn\'t expect to like this but we loved the first round!  Second round was a little heavy-handed on the vodka.\n\nMew Breeze - sugar cane sochu vodka cranberry juice grapefuit juice tonic water - basically a fancified cranberry vodka - surprisingly bland as well.\n\nThis place was definitely fun but the food and cocktails were inconsistent (still gotta give the staff props for cranking out all the food and drinks so quickly)   I\'d definitely come back on a quieter night.\n\nI won\'t bore you with the entire list we ordered mostly since I can\'t remember everything we ordered but here are some "must gets" and some "avoids":\n\nDefinitely order:\nsalmon sashimi tacos (order multiples)\nhotate carpaccio \ntuna tartare\ngrilled short ribs\n\nPass:\nPork Skewers - super chewy\ngyu tataki\nudon\n\nForgot to add the guys had a great time as there were definitely tons of attractive women sitting at the other tables and working at the restaurant.' u"Every time I am in NYC I have a strange craving for Izakaya. Most recently I came here for lunch on a weekday. Cash only and very reasonably priced. This time I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and a tuna roll. The ramen tasted amazing (flavorful broth and not too salty) but it came with only 1 thin slice of the charisu. I hate to comment on portion since taste was on but 1 slice just isn't enough despite this being a lunch sized portion. The sushi was ok but nothing special. Overall the entire meal came to be with tip and tax $20 exactly. Service was quick and staff was friendly. \n\nQuick note this resturant is a bit difficult to find if you are coming here for the first time. There is only a small doorway on the north side of the street that leads to the resturant downstairs. \n\nOverall this resturant is a staple whenever I am in the area. I highly recommend it to you as a solid lunch spot! It will not disappoint!" u"I devoured the 2 items I ordered: pepper tuna salad and fancy roll. It was delicious. I cleaned my plates.\n\nI made use of every drop of the wasabi dressing in its pepper tuna salad. I rolled each piece of tuna and mixed salad in the dressing. The wasabi dressing made the salad harmonious. It's not a peppery salad at all. \n\nSince I've been craving cream cheese and eel I ordered the Fancy Roll minus eel sauce. Cheese and eel is an unusual pairing but it works for me. The cream cheese provides gooey goodness. It hit the spot!\n\nI wish the place wasn't in a basement. However place is nice clean and relaxing. The staff kept our water cups full and thirsts quenched for beer etc. Happy hour pricing on limited drinks menu 5-6 pm every day." u"Try it. If you don't try this spot you'll be missing out. Truly a great find.\n\nWalking down into a basement of the building you find yourself uncertain of what to expect. You see a large crowd big line and wait at least 20-30 mins usually. Let me tell you it is well worth the wait.  Bonus is that while you wait they have $15 pitchers of Sapporo at the bar. The seating is pretty packed together and sometimes you have to share a long table with another group but that's still fine. You're there for the incredible food after all right? Food actually comes out surprisingly quick for how busy it is and this is where this spot easily earns the 5 stars. My personal favorite is the shrimp udon and the garlic fried rice but I've been here a few times and I always get a mix of sharing plates with friends and everything I've had has been amazing. The biggest plus is that you can have a meal for 2 for like ~$40 which is crazy good for the quality you get.\n\nMake sure you try out this spot!" u'Came here on my first night in New York and I really enjoyed the Friday atmosphere and dishes! I am a big fan of tapas style where you can enjoy with a group of friends. Since it was my first time here I let my friends order. There was a mix of fresh tasting sashimi dishes that were seared and sauced a noodle dish and some skewer dishes. I also enjoyed the slush beer they have on draft. It was my first time trying anything like this and I really enjoyed the refreshing taste.' u"I really appreciate the server trying to seat us when we came in at 9:40 and they were closing at 10! The kitchen closes at 10 actually and since this place is so popular they have to turn people away. The server explained that we might not be seated if people don't leave but he went out of his way to ask the boss to let us stay. We got menus and got our food ordered before being seated and the whole process was fine because he let us know beforehand.\n\nWe were then able to be seated as some people finally left as well as the other two pairs that were waiting with us. My sushi was delicious and my boyfriend's rice bowl and other roll was good too. I love the ambiance here and the cocktails are even more inviting. It's a perfect place for a date or just a meal. Prices aren't outrageous either! Give this place a chance and you won't be disappointed." u"I think I'm obsessed with noodles! This place definitely is high on my list whenever I'm in NY.  \n\nIt took us a few minutes to figure out where the entrance is...it could pass for a speakeasy. The hidden door stairway leading down and a bunch of people waiting on a Tuesday night added to the excitement.  Our wait time was 30-40 minutes for 2 but we got seated within 20 minutes. The service from the hostess to servers was excellent. They were fast & attentive. \n\nSo the main attraction:\n\nKushi Yaki - an assortment of chicken skewers; I thought it's pretty filling so I waited to get my noodles before I finished it. The chicken balls were my favorite...very flavorful.\n\nYaki Udon - the description just says beef onions & mushroom but it had more complex flavors than that. It was so tasty I practically inhaled the food! :)\n\nOverall I had a great time continuing my birthday celebration there. Great food & service happy customer! Check it out if you haven't already!" u"We came as a group of 5 on a Friday night and the wait was about an hour. \n\nWe had the:\nTuna tartar dome: it was a small portion but the tuna was creamy and fresh 4/5\nSalmon tacos: This was hands down my favorite item! I could've ate 5 or more of these alone. 5/5\nDeep fried baby octopus: About the same breading as the chicken also tender. 3.5/5\nChicken karaage: Tender chicken but I think it needed a sauce of some sort. Nothing special 3.5/5\nGalbi: The seasoning was a little too sweet for me and there was no char on the meat 3/5\nOmu soba: A unique spin off omurice but the noodles didn't have that much flavor. Good filler dish though 3/5.\nMew special roll: 3/5\n\nWe ordered a variety of drinks including the Moscow mew sparkling matcha and a hibiki on ice. They were quite generous with the alcohol pour especially with the hibiki they also have a good deal on the Hibiki 17!" u'This place is one of my favorite place in midtown\nI went there last thursday at 7:30pm I was wait around 30min thursday night has 30min wait is not that bad Has waitwhich mean is many people love this place. While i was wait i grab a beer at front of bar and talk with my friend you can feel time goes really fast.\nthen when i got the table. i ordered "kimchi cream udon" and "nabe" for two of us first i thought it might be small for two but it was good enough for two girls.\nspecially i really really love kimchi cream udon if you guys love noodle and creamy food? then you guys must get a "kimchi cream udon" never regret !!\nand I was think about next time cuz their has a lot of my favorite food! i will try one by one.\n+during the wait host(the guy with grey shirt) was super nice to me that is big reason for wait the line.' u"Our first time at this awesome underground restaurant was a success! We ordered sushi and next time want to try other food because the menu is huge! We ordered the spicy tuna roll Maki Maki roll and the dynamite roll. Really enjoyed the dynamite roll! The sushi was fresh and tasted great! Love the restaurant's decor and the service was great! We will be back!!" u'My family and I actually really enjoyed our dinner here at Izakaya Mew. The service was great and attentive but we waited for about 1 hour (packed Saturday night). \n\nCreamy udon kimchi noodles was yummy! Very unique and different (kinda like an Italian dish). \n\nYakitori was good and plentiful and their takoyaki was nice and crispy. \n\nAll in all we had a good time despite the long wait! Would definitely come back - such a fun and hippy atmosphere downstairs in a secluded basement type walkway.' u'Lots of interesting dishes in this always-packed restaurant; Monday evening and about a 15 minute wait for a table of two. Considering the popularity they do pretty well with the space and frequency of service.\n\nDecided to share a few items: Sashimi Tacos ($8) Omu Soba ($11) and the Kushi Yaki ($14). Tacos have tender salmon meat to go along with guacamole on top. I did like the flavors though felt the filling could have used something crunchy in the center to counteract the intense creaminess. Omu Soba is fairly large: a generous serving of noodles underneath well cooked omelet with various sweet sauces. Everything is cooked well just needed a bit of a kick to bring it all together. Kushi Yaki are several skewers of meat lightly roasted. All very well made particularly liked the pork belly and chicken breast. To wash it all down had the "Frozen Beer" ($7) - a picture worthy beer slushy on top of a pint of Kirin. Decent taste that probably would be even better with a porter or stout.\n\nAgain speed of service here is key yet they don\'t rush you our of your table as well. Would like to come back to try the ramen.' u'This place was great and super accommodating. I came in with a big group for a friends birthday celebration. It was my first time and I was not disappointed because someone in the group said it was their favorite izakaya place. I shared an order of the omu soba with my boyfriend and I kind of wished I had ordered my own. Everyone had a little bite of each dish that was ordered at the table and everything tasted pretty good. I definitely liked the omu soba the best. I will be coming back again to try their other dishes. I liked all the cute little fall decorations that the place had going that night. Overall it was a good experience with good food.'],0.7003,0.492,0.508,0.0
52.District Social,[u"Love coming here after work with a large group of co workers. We literally raid the top floor. The decor and the vibe of this place is nice. Upstairs looks pretty fancy.\n\nI come here a lot to drink with co workers. The happy hour deal isn't insane but drinks are made very well and bartenders know their stuff. They have really good French fries and appetizers if you want to eat something while you drink.\n\nDistrict social is great for a small to large group after work if you aren't extremely money concerned." u"Hearing about District Social from a friend I went with 2 friends after work for Happy Hour during the week. \n\nHappy Hour is 4-7pm\n\nThere is a handful of beer options $4-5 drafts\nWell drinks $6\nHouse red/white & prosecco $7\nCucumber gimlet & el Diablo drink $8\n\nAlways a fan of happy hours like District Social were they honor happy hour whether you are sitting or at the bar. At 5:30pm there were a decent amount of people but by 6:30pm it was packed couldn't get a table if you tried in the upstairs dining.\n\nSince we were hungry we ended up sharing \nCroquettes (3 come in an order for $6)\n\nOther apps are a bit pricey ranging from $10-18\nFlatbreads $17 each & Entrees range from $19-29\n\nI got the Potato Gnocchi with king oyster mushrooms truffle broth ($20) it was good but much lighter than I had expected.\n\nWish they did have a food Happy Hour even if it was just until 7:30 I think they would have more people ordering." u"I came here to meet a friend who was in town for the week. We were trying to find a place that was middle-ish for the both of us and we ended up here! \n\nOverall I think it's a great place to grab a bite to eat and maybe a drink. I didn't get a cocktail although I was interested in them. We split a bottle of wine and it was fine. We stayed on the lower end and the one we originally went for was actually a half bottle but it wasn't mentioned on the list. So I'd make sure it's a full bottle before they open one for you. \n\nWe both got the burger. I believe it was happy hour when we were there so that's what we ordered off of. It was really good! We both downed them so fast. The fries were really great as well.\n\nYou have to order and pay at the bar which can get tricky if it's busy by the time you leave like it was for us. We had to wait a while in a crowd of people to pay our bill at the bar so that was a little annoying. But other than that this is a great place. The ambiance is cool and chill and the food is great." u"4 stars because one of the dishes was a complete miss otherwise the rest were perfectly executed and caused a pretty party on my palate.\n\nStarted with the croquettes got the goat cheese croquette and one that was a specially featured croquette. Also got the steak tartare which was the unfortunate miss of the night :(.  The steak tartare tasted purely of horseradish.  So very disappointing.  I did not even see nor taste a quail egg and I had been looking forward to breaking the yolk over the tartare!  Perhaps it was not a good cut of meat so the chef tried to overcome the quality with horseradish.  I am not sure.  Each of us in my group had one small bite and then we set it aside.\n\nThe entrees fared much better.  We ordered the duck breast with pureed carrot and the steelheaded trout atop potatoes in a sunchoked cream.  These two were great hits and we all fought over the cripsy skin and the last few pieces of the duck!!  The carrot puree was sooo smooth and had the right amount of flavor and acid to bite through the rich duck.  The brussel sprouts went down with equal fervor.  That creme fresh with the caramelization on the veggies brought out an earthiness to the brussel sprout that complimented the slightly sour sweet creme fraiche.  All in all great foods for the mains!\n\nWe splurged and got a three desserts to share amongst the 4 of us:  the flan another dessert (don't remember I concentrated on the flan and chocolate!) and molten chocolate cake with caramel.  \n\nAll in all a great atmosphere great service and strong drinks to wash down well executed food.  For the 3 dudes and myself that I went with we split all of the food and it was more than enough for us each to walk away feeling full.  This would be a great spot to catch up with friends who are in town to bring visitors to a typical after business place near Herald Square or for a good and stiff drink at the end of a long day." u"Very impressive.\n\nDistrict Social has the appearance of a trendy bar restaurant with New York flare but it's so much more than that. From well executed dishes stiff drinks and killer desserts District Social hits the spot for an after work location. This is the perfect place for drinks and small bites. The lamb skewers and charred octopus are a must and make sure to save room for dessert. \n\nCome for a cocktail but definitely stay for a bite." u"What a pleasant surprise! Great for a meal before any show or event at MSG. We were heading to Billy Joel and seems like everyone else here was as well. Maybe that explains the 40+ crowd (which unfortunately I classify as). \n\nWe started with the croquettes and two appetizers and all were delicious. The risotto was better than the goat cheese but both were great. \n\nWe opted for the fresh mozzarella with balsamic glaze. I am actually surprised they did not make a Burrata version. But it was really quite good. I could definitely see us coming here for happy hour and ordering a bunch of flatbreads. \n\nI had the chicken and my husband had the short rib fettuccine. Both were really good. We ordered the cauliflower but I did not love it. Sometimes I forget how bitter cauliflower can be. \n\nPros:\nNice atmosphere\nGreat drink menu \nGood appetizers \nReally good entrees \nNice staff\nClose to Madison Square Garden \n\nCons:\nNone really\nLow ceilings so hard to hear but that's par for a bar atmosphere (we did not mind) \n\nI recommend and was certainly be back." u"I wasn't amazed when i first got in looks like your regular midtown bar/restaurant i order the grilled pork chops and that's when i decided to leave this review its very rare for me to really appreciate a meal like this.. but i can tell without doubt that this was the best pork I've eaten so far with a beer on the side.. cant go wrong definitely coming back and super recommend this place" u"The food is amazing the service was horrible. Our waiter was maybe having an off day but we've only been there once and he was terrible.\n\nThey have a lot of beers on tap and a whole lot of ciders. They recommend you ask the server or check the app. Only the app worked for us. When the guys asked for just seasonal beers to be listed he listed one and said that was it. They had maybe 6+ on tap at the time. I asked about ciders and was told they had NONE on tap (not even close to true). I tried the one listed on the menu and tried one James found in the app for my second drink but the waiter was terrible.\n\nThe drinks were great and the food was WONDERFUL. I'd definitely go back. I now know to check the app so if the waiter sucks I'll still have the full selection of ciders to view and the guys will know what beers are available." u"I was in the area & decide to check this place out not sure why we didn't notice it before. \nDecent happy hour specials I tried the Diablo cocktail interesting mix w the tequila & ginger beer at first I wasn't feeling the drink taste wise but it grew on me not bad did end up getting a nice buzz by the end of the night. \nMy friend had a Whiskey & soda not sure what Whiskey they use taste wise .. ahh but ok but decent enough for happy hour. \nAs for the place not too bad decent since with plenty of room by the bar. \nThere is seating towards the back & upstairs plenty of room to hang around upfront by the bar area during happy hour it's not super packed but good enough. \nTypical bar decor service at the bar was not bad considering the place was crowded. \nOverall decent place to grab drinks for happy hour." u'Going out to a pre birthday dinner with dear stepdaughter Emily. It was extremely loud when we arrived. Well yeah cause it was still happy hour and boy was it happening. Good thing about that is Emily found a new place to go to. We sat in the back of the space and thankfully it became much quieter. \n\nWe had the oyster croquettes and grilled octopus apps. We especially lovedthe octopus perfectly cooked and prepared then displayed as if a painting on a canvass. The wine suggested by our waitress was perfectly paired with our meal.' u"Although this place is very appealing to the eye unfortunately it did not impress much to the taste buds. We started with a bubbly Sauvignon which was very good and enjoyed the croquettes- honestly can't say enough about how delicious they were. \n\nThe downside was the main course. I had the steel head- the fish itself was not bad but they put fish roe all over the potatoes which I had to pick out. They do not include that description on the menu and not everyone likes fish eggs. The potatoes were overpowered with cream and very salty. My gf had the short rib and that too was salty and dry. She had mentioned the sauce in the dish overpowered the taste of the meat and ate mostly the fettuccine. With the wonderful ratings on this place I was expecting more and left underwhelmed." u"Let's start by saying I love the lay of this place a little in the darker side but very nice set up. Good for after work drink which seems to be a go to place for a good amount of people. Now most of the food is Moroccan infused which in my book was a plus. We decided with a party of four why not try a few different things to that seemed interesting. We got the fried Fava Beans and fried chick peas .Amazing!!! You would never had thought they would have tasted so good. We also got the steak Tartare and for those that don't mind raw beef it's worth a try it was a good combo with the egg and greens with a touch of citrus. The pork Belly flat bread is a must try. Super crispy and full of flavors. The potato soup was yummy and had very nice flavors and very creamy . \n\nThe short rib pasta was delicious with a unique twist with the pasta and the short rib just fell apart. \nThe grilled prawns were cooked to perfection with a nice medley of flavors . The croquets were simple but delicious. Now we saved the best for last which our waiter recommended which was the fried red snapper. OMG amazing  crispy skin soft and flakey inside and stuffed with couscous. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions. I would definitely try this place again." u'The small pizzas we had were very tasty. The atmosphere was busy but service was also attentive. One thing that stood out was the Brussels sprouts. They were unreal. Loved them. One of the best I ever had.' u"On my short visit to NYC I heavily relied on Yelp reviews in search of great local spots to visit. District Social did not disappoint. I stopped in on a Thursday night and the bar was packed however the actual restaurant itself wasn't bad in terms of wait time. We were promptly greeted and seated upstairs. I tried the fried chickpeas; amazing. The pork belly flatbread; phenomenal. The spinach salad was also delicious. By the time I had paid the bill the restaurant became as packed as the bar. It was a full house all around but a chill/fun ambiance in general.  This seems like a great spot for happy hour/dinner.\n\nI really liked this place and am very glad I stopped by.\nTwo thumbs up from Miami Florida" u'Happy Hour Happy Hour until 8pm :-)\nMy group of three girlfriends were immediately received and seated on the second level in a cozy corner.  We enjoyed cocktails and ordered a few bites off the menu. The drinks came promptly and were delicious. I had the cucumber gimlet...well balanced great price with a mellow kick (I had 3). Our waiter was attentive and the venue filled up by 7 pm. Food was tasty although my favorite has to be the roasted brussel sprouts. Amazing. Sooo good.' u"Surprisngly good food!  I am not a fan of this part of Midtown near Penn station - it has the worst area of food drinks and fun.  BUT that being said this place is one of those rare exceptions.  I loved the food and vibes here.  My friend hosted a birthday dinner and I found the menu interesting.  I ended up ordering the yuca fries (which I'm not going to lie - I have had better yuca fries - check out Cienfuegos if you want some good ones!).  But I loved their shrimp pesto flatbread and everything else I munched from others including the lamb chops.\n\nMy drink was definitely strong and my server was always nowhere to be seen but for the price and food - if I want to have a cute date here or drinks with friends I might be back." u"I have mix feelings about this place because some of the food was good and some wasn't too good. I have the chicken and rice and some of the rice was not cooked all the way but it was a group of 30 so maybe that's why. The bar tender was kind of rude and that was a turn off because we were stuck with him all night since it was a private event. The appetizers were good and the chocolate dessert was good too." u"Good food for the location. We came here for a flavorful American dinner before our concert at Madison Square Garden. The decoration and menu feel like classic old-school Manhattan - this isn't necessarily a cute loud or hipster place. It's spacious and dimly lit. The food is good though. I ordered the short ribs and fettucine my boyfriend ordered the flank steak and we shared the brussel sprouts. Each dish had an umami edge to it - savory with a sidekick of sweet. \n\n\nThe portions were very generous. I couldn't finish the gigantic hunk of short rib. The fettucine tasted like it was infused with a bit of truffle oil which lent it a rich but not overwhelming fragrance. \n\nI enjoyed the brussel sprouts which were roasted and caramelized. We opted to get the creme fraiche on the side and it turned out the dish was tasty enough. A dip in creme fraiche made the brussel sprouts even richer so it just depends on your preference. \n\nThis would be a great restaurant to come to with a group especially if you have plans before or afterwards in the area (Penn Station.)" u"Really enjoyed our meal at District Social.  The steak tar tar was flavorful and delicious. I am a huge octopus fan so I ordered the octopus appetizer as my entree.  It did not disappoint; it was flavorful perfectly cooked and not at all chewy.  My wife's croquettes and flatbread were very tasty as well.  Our cocktails were expensive but hey you're in midtown and it could be a lot worse.  \n\nService was solid and the room was far enough from the bar that things weren't too loud.  Overall a great experience would definitely recommend to folks looking for a solid pre-theater meal." u"The service from the entire staff and our waiter Ben was amazing. \nThe croquets are a go-to appetizer for sure. The cauliflower pistachio croquets were little bombs of flavor & my boyfriend ordered the special octopus croquets which he said were amazing as well. \nWe then split the buffalo mozzarella flat bread which was perfectly crispy. The combination of the balsamic glaze and tomato sauce did put it a bit on the sweeter end of the scale. \n\nWe went during happy hour & while tequila is always my first choice the Il diablo cocktail was too sweet for me so I would suggest the house red for my taste buds. \n\nBen told us the chef Jiovanni makes almost all of the desserts in house so we had to try the molten chocolate cake. Which swiftly with the help of the dolce de leche made it's way to the top of my lava cake list...which is quite extensive. \n\nOverall we'll definitely be back."],0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0
201.Mozzarella & Vino,[u'I went to Mozzarella & Vino to experience diner and I have to say that I spent a really good time. My friend and I were given good advice as to which wine to choose and the plates were matched perfectly to the wine...\nWe had a classic tasting of Buffalo Mozzarella buffalo provola and burrata served with cherry tomatoes  as appetizer. I chose the chickens medallions flavored with black summer truffles served with French beans fingerling potatoes and organic cherry tomatoes as main course and the tarte du mascarpone tiramisu style as the desert. \nThe food was freshly prepared and it was delightful. The service was really good too. Mozzarella & Vino is definitely a lovely place to enjoy good food.' u'The design of Mozzarella & Vino" restaurant is very simple and upscale. The soft lights and classic music was great for our dinner. My friend and I started started with wine Vermentiono Di Gallura. I would say it was very good decision to trust the server\'s suggestion. Our waiter as I knew later worked here for long time had a pretty good taste of food. Our appetizer had 3 types of mozzarella: buffalo mozzarella smoked mozzarella and burrata. It was one of the most delicious mozzarella I have ever had. All type of Mozzarellas in the restaurant are from Italy. I would say they truly deserve to be known in New York for the Mozzarella cheese.  \n\nOur entree was lasagna. The server mentioned that it was one of their specials for today. The lasagna came very warm and delicious. I was very pleased with the taste of lasagna because it contained mushrooms. An interesting combination. \n\nWe finished our dinner with dessert. It was one of my favorites Carrot Cake topped with rabiola cheese and mascarpone mouse. To be honest I wasn\'t sure how cheese as an ingredient would make dessert sweet and delicious. Believe me the restaurant surprised me when I tasted it. It was not just sweet but very light taste. \nThe Service was very polite and friendly. The manager visited our table a couple times to make sure that we are good. It gave me feeling that they have high respect for their clients. \nIn the end of our dinner we were introduced to the owner of the restaurant Gianfranco Sorrentino. He is a nice man with friendly and open personality. \nAnd he also gave us advice us to visit their other restaurant Leopard des artistes I would definitely follow his suggestion. \nIf you would like to try different types of mozzarella light dessert with couple of good wines you should definitely visit "Mozzarella & Vino". You will be so pleased with the service atmosphere and of course their delicious food.' u"Nice dinner option if you're visiting any of the after-hours MOMA events.\nWe ordered the eggplant mozzarella rolls meatballs & tiramisu.\nI really enjoyed the eggplant mozzarella rolls. It was a little annoyed because it didn't really have much pasta options but then the name of the restaurant is literally cheese & wine so I let it go. It does have an extensive wine menu and alot of cheese options.\nDon't get the meatballs. It looked great but it was really dry. The tiramisu was good and the host was really attentive so I would give them 3 1/2 stars if I could. If you're looking for wine and cheese come to this place but if you are looking for Italian food with pastas etc... then I would go somewhere else." u'The name says it all. Stick with cheese and wine and you will have a good experience. As my son said don\'t try the "after- pasti".  We ventured to the entree section and that was a bad idea. Meatball entree was over priced and dry as was the chicken. The waiter was inexperienced and uninspiring. \n\nThe rolled mozzarella with pesto and prosciutto was very good. The ricotta and honey was well presented and tasty.' u"I must say this is the BEST restaurant I have been to. Their appetizers are delicious so are their drinks and entree's. I had Niola as my waiter and he was very attentive and great with recommendation on certain dishes. My boyfriend and I had the meats and cheese for appetizer and lasagna for entree- must say is delicious. We both had drinks which were super tasty! My favorite spot by far." u'Just got two glasses of delicious ros\xe8 from northern Italy and some complementary bread focaccia with tasty olive oil.\nSuch a great place to hang out after a MoMA visit. Right outside the museum 54th exit. \nLovely atmosphere. Great service.' u'Had a good experience here though nothing too special. BF and I shared:\n\n+ citrus and avocado salad\n+ meat and cheese platter \n+ ravioli of the day\n+ braised lamb and mashed potatoes\n+ dark chocolate almond cake\n+ mascarpone "tiramisu" style\n\nThe salad was great. Charcuterie (you can customize it) and chocolate cake were the standouts. Prosciutto was probably the best I\'ve had outside of Italy. The ravioli had a nice texture but the sauce filling and flavor were a little watery. The lamb was decent. Didn\'t care for the tiramisu - it was kind of bland. 3.5 stars overall because some dishes fell flat but the others were quite tasty. Excellent service and lovely ambience.' u"We explored this Italian space and appreciated the quiet in the heart of midtown for dinner. Don't come here if you are looking for a bar scene. \n\nWe enjoyed some classic Sicilian dishes like caponata and wine. We also tried the mozzarella and prosciutto. We shared some good pasta and caught up on our lives. \n\nI did feel the wine was at a premium but the waiter was kind with the pours. I wondered if that was part of the trick or if they seriously want to charge those amounts for 4oz and 6oz. glasses. I understand specialty wines have a premium but not every wine. \n\nWorth a visit for a quiet time after the museum or work." u'For nyc the prices are reasonable but the food was ok its good but nothing really special.  Wait till you get home instead and skip the nyc price and food.' u'pretty neat place. right by the MOMA which is a area with not a lot of food options specially for a lower price range than fine dining. I have the barbera red wine and the mortadella panini all was very good. Service was great though I was the only person in the restaurant haha. \n\nI was enjoyed it very much they have a patio area as well which I will explore if in the area again.' u'ambiance food and wine is excellent. Must try the lasagna!! stop in after MoMa...right across the st and you wont be disapointed.' u'Kinda felt like I was back in Italy.\n\nGreat meat and cheeses.  Like really great.. the real stuff from Italy.  They even had some of the more abstract items that you rarely see in the US.\n\nGreat wine at a good price.\n\nAttentive service (which is different than in Italy generally where they kind of just dissapear) \n\nAbsolutely loved the place and will be back again soon.' u'I like their breadsticks. I like the crackery sticks these were good a bit stale but still tasty. the bread was good.\n\nI got the lasagna. I enjoyed it.  My girlfriend go the mozzarella wrap. that was also good. \n\nthey have a nice room in the back. I enjoyed the ambience of the place.' u'Great food and service the salmon dish was the best Salmon I ever had. \nCarrot cake is a must \nDefinitely will come back' u'Real rating is 2.5 stars.  Don\'t let the 4 star reviews fool you.  If you want expensive wine and meats and cheese place then this place is fine 3.5 stars.  If you want anything further than that find another Italian restaurant there are many to choose from in the area.  At first my wife got the chicken it was disgusting.  Completely dry no taste and cold.  The waiter came over to ask how everything was.  And then right away ASKED US if they chicken was dry.  This is obviously a common problem shouldn\'t have served it.  Instead she got the "homemade ravioli"... side not the other people with us ordered the lasagna but they brought out the ravioli by accident so brought it back in the kitchen when realized it was wrong.  When my wife changed to ravioli it came out in about 1 minute.  They obviously didn\'t throw out the ravioli that they brought out by accident and reused it for me wife instead.  It was cold and blah tasting.\n\n  The "homemade lasagna" was subpar.  Minimal taste mushrooms in it looked like they were straight out taken from the package and just thrown on top. \n\n  On good note the buffalo ricotta cheese was good.  Nice waiters.' u'Good ambience. Good service. Food was really good. Get the calamari. Food was a bit expensive but all in all a good place.' u'We had a lovely evening here with friends.  We were able to move our reservation forward and got a table in the covered outside area.  Our waiter was attentive without being intrusive.  We ordered wine appetizers entrees and coffee/dessert separately and it seemed seamless.  Our food was tasty and was reasonably priced.  The Midtown location is perfect for us. We will definitely return.' u"Came here for a company dinner.  Service was fantastic and we really enjoyed the wine. We had three appetizer options and all were great I'd say highlight of the dinner: spinach salad Faro salad cheese/tomato/eggplant. \n\nI asked our server whether I should go for cheese ravioli or chicken and he replied ravioli. He should have asked me how hungry I was... When the dish arrived it was significantly smaller in portion compare to the other dishes that our table had ordered from the prix fix menu. If I had not had so much bread I would not get filled up with the ravioli as entree even with the appetizers. The flavor was also OK to me so overall a 3 star dish for my taste. if I go back I'd order something else or maybe the ravioli as part of the appetizer dish to share with someone.The portion of the chicken was more generous and fit for entree. \n\nDessert got the chocolate cake an it tasted very good (love that it was low sweet) but it was more on the dry side. Coffee had really good flavor. \n\nIf I had to rank I'd say appetizer/wine was my favorite then the dessert and then the entree." u"We had a great experience here for dinner the other night. Walking out of the MoMA earlier I saw the adorable tables and facade of this place and couldn't resist asking my fianc\xe9 if we could come back later that night. We had a lovely cheese and charcuterie plate along with a very fresh salad and the homemade lasagna and loved everything. Would recommend" u'A small restaurant for snacks Mozzarella & wine! directly across from MOMA Museum on 54th street a casual spot for a break from the city streets. just a nice place to relax & have a wine & cheese! Perfect for a lite bite! owned by Gatopardo restaurant down the street!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
70.Royal Halal,[u"I recently moved away from New York and this place is easily one of the spots I miss most about living here. however I'm fortunate enough to still have a job that lets me come back up roughly once a month. and yet the lovely couple who runs this cart still remembers me. I walk up he immediately starts making kati rolls. even if I haven't been by in a month plus. he'll even get creative and make new concoctions which are always delicious (eating one now). \n\nattention to detail like that really make this place stand out. can only imagine how many people come thru on a daily or even weekly basis. would give them 6 stars if I could." u"The couple that runs this cart is SO SWEET! They are so kind all the time and the food they make is of great value! A friend recommended this cart to me and it's been such a great spot to grab a quick meal. I tried the mixed combo plate $6 which was enough for about 1.5 meals and the flavors are great. I recently tried the lamb Kati rolls (2 for $6) and the wrap itself was so buttery which was probably really unhealthy but it tasted great! The owner will probably remember after your first visit which is so nice of them and they let you adjust the spice level!\n\nPros: kind owners great food fast stamp card!!\n\nCons: none as of now!!" u"Royal Halal is a paradise for savory oily cheap eats. \n\nI came here on a weekday evening to catch a quick dinner. The man at the cart surprisingly remembered my friend's previous orders and welcomed me with friendly and genuine service. \n\nMy Kati roll was deliciously greasy. The wrap itself was thick and buttery encasing copious amounts of sweet and savory chicken. The red sauce is actually spicy here; I'd probably recommend going easy on it if you are unaccustomed to spice. \n\nThis food is great to cope with a hang over or as an occasional treat. I'll be sure to come back to try other items on their menu." u"It was late and our options are limited and we found this food truck with good rating so we tried the lamb briyani.\n\nFood came fast and I have to say it's better than the halal guys. Meats were very juicy moist and tasty. Portion is less than halal guys but the quality took my loyalty from halal guys. I would come back again to try other stuffs from their menu." u"5 stars. And for good reason. Royal Halal is run by a Bangladeshi couple with the help of a couple relatives/close friends. Really friendly people.\n\nComing here a few times now I've tried their Kati roll and chicken/gyros over rice and both were exceptional. One thing you will notice about the food here is that it is extremely savory and colorfully flavorful (makes me want to write a song about it). Especially their wrap/naan: butterlicious and easily the best I've ever had.\n\nThe price is expected for Halal carts at $6. For $6 the quantity is generous. They will usually take about 4-6 minutes to get your food ready but luckily there's rarely a line. Another plus is that they have a stamp card that lets you get a free dish after you buy 7 entrees.\n\nIt'll be hard not going here 5 times a week tbh." u"Ok for halal street food it's actually pretty good. Street meat is highly processed and will be high in salt. So if you can't handle that do what I do and I take it home and mix it with more rice veggies etc... \nI liked that this place has a more Indian influence in the food. I've only tried this cart once but I'll definitely come back. We had the chicken masala and lamb and one with fish. Both were very good spicy... definitely better than the halal guys. That place is all hype. \nPortions were great. Meat was tender. Will stick with the usual chicken and lamb next time. \nThis is only something we'll eat a few times a year since it's greasy and street food isn't very clean/healthy." u'We were in town for a few days and needed our chicken and rice fix. I was worried about spice levels but the owner was happy to keep my chicken tikka on rice order mild. My husband ordered the chapli kabab on rice (melt in your mouth kababs).\n\nDelicious and will visit again and again! \nPS I loved it way more than halal guys. I usually feel bloated and unwell after a splurge at halal guys- but this place I felt light (and no carb coma either!).' u"I have to up my rating to 5 Stars. After a month of eating here once a week trying different dishes he has never disappointed. There were a few times he surprised me how good it was particularly the Chapli and curry chicken. Don't get any add on sauces for those and he'll do some magic on them.\n\nHe truly takes pride in his cooking.  He was beaming when he showed me that he was #2 in a grubstreet article." u"This place is amazing. Everyone who works in the cart (it rotates!) is impossibly friendly and warm no matter how busy or how bad the weather.\n\nThey treat you like family! They're making great food too. You gotta go here! I love this place so much.\n\nGet the chicken Tikka or the biryani!" u"Great hospitality great food and great price! Can't go wrong here. If you haven't tried it yet make the trip!" u"Found this place through a Yelp search. \n\nMost of the well known Halal carts in midtown are near Rockefeller center. I was looking for something closer to Port Authority. Royal Halal fit the bill. It's located about a block away from Bryant Park on 44th St. and 6th Ave.\n\nThis cart is run by a nice couple. They are always smiling and saying hi when you approach the cart. It's quite a different experience from the rudeness I've experience at most of the halal carts in the city.\n\nI've ordered the chicken and rice here. $5.50. It's very tasty and served to order. They ask how you like it and adjust the spices and sauces according to your preferences.\n\nThe chicken and rice has an Indian flavor to it. It's somewhat similar to Sammy's or the Soho halal cart.\n\nThey also have a punch card. Buy 7 and get one free. Not a bad deal with the price and the punch card. They have some other dishes that I haven't tried but probably will in the future that look interesting like the chicken biryani and chicken tikka masala." u"Great food for a great price lunch without the hassle in the city you can't beat that for lunch." u'Royal halal was ranked #2 for halal chicken rice in nyc on grubstreet\nhttp://www.grubstreet.com/bestofnewyork/best-halal-cart-in-nyc.html\n\nMy coworkers and I eat here at least once a week.\n\nThe price is right and after 7 purchases you get 1 free.  \n\nYou can also have it be a low carb meal if you tell them you want your chicken on a salad instead of rice.  You can make it low cal if you tell them to go easy on the white sauce as well.' u'"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" is absolutely right. I\'m talkin\' creamy white sauce spicy hot sauce and tangy green sauce (chutney) drizzled over perfectly seasoned tender chicken tikka that lays atop a bed of flavorful basmati rice. You really can\'t go wrong here. I have seen the quality of food from other famous halal trucks steadily decline but not here. I\'ve been here several times and each time I\'ve had consistently excellent service. The meal was not greasy at all the portion size was just perfect and the salad was fresh and crisp as it should be. I ate this meal two hours ago and don\'t feel the post-prandial crash I usually do after eating platters from any other establishment so that\'s an excellent indicator of quality. Check out the picture and I\'ll be darned if the sight doesn\'t put your salivary glands in a frenzy (in a good way of course haha)! \n\nThe auntie and uncle who run the cart are very pleasant and always greet customers with a smile which is always uplifting after a long day of travel study or work. I can\'t wait to try out the other items on the menu (they have a pretty extensive menu) because I know that the quality will be top-notch and the flavor spot-on!' u"I came here with 2 other friends. First off he messed up all 3 of our orders. We were too far away to do anything about it so we decided to started eating. After about two bites they could not eat anymore. The taste was so terrible it was too salty and there were cardamons strewed all over the food for some reason. I continued to eat only to suffer severe indigestion halfway through. I had to stop because the salt was too much. After about 30 minutes I had to run to the restroom because the food destroyed my system.\n\nTL;DR: Avoid eating here. For your stomach's sake." u'I LOVE Royal Halal. I come here once a week for an amazing plate of Tikka Masala Chicken over rice and salad. It tastes delicious its fresh its prepared by a very friendly couple and the price point is solid. Why go to a chain for a salad burger or pre-made sandwich - when you can get a fresh hot meal and support a family run small business. You cannot go wrong with trying this out and getting hooked. OH - and after you buy 7 meals - the next one is free. Amazing!' u"As an Indian food snob I really go to South Asian joints for fear of a 'currified' version of my favourite dishes. Royal Halal sounded promising in reviews and I walked over this afternoon to try it out. \nI ordered a Kathi Roll ($6 for 2 pieces) which made for a very sumptuous lunch. A little oily but the food was pretty authentic and the spices were on point. Fora moment I was back in Mumbai!\n\nThe cart offers a better variety than most other carts - mostly South Asian and this play to your strength strategy works very well for them - and us!\n\nYou can always order online and go pick up your food. It's clean and the quality is pretty good too. The best part - you can always walk 2 blocks to Bryant Park and enjoy your fresh hot meal there. \n\nI will be visiting soon." u'In midtown Manhattan there are two food vendors worth note and Royal Halal is the best of them.\n\nFreshly prepared and as spicy as you like - this is a welcome break from the numerous chained restaurants that fail to deliver. The Chana Daal is fantastic and never fails to deliver. The owner has a keen eye and never fails to recognize his repeat customers.\n\nBeyond veggie the chicken is also excellent if you are so inclined. Generally I would recommend anything - for the price the taste and the expediency I cannot imagine even the possibility of a better alternative. \n\nPlease for your own sake - visit Royal Halal it is well worth it. Perhaps you can even plan for a later lunch to avoid the line entirely if not it remains well worth the short stop off for excellent fresh and healthy fare.' u"I had chicken and lamb combo over rice this time I went last time i had chicken tikka and samosas. Everything is great so it doesn't matter. I asked for it to be very spicy and he legitimately took out a fresh jalapeno and carefully chopped it over my food. You get the point. Food is cheap tasty and Alam is the nicest guy in the world. Disregarding all that what makes the food here stand out to me is the rice. HOW DO YOU MAKE SUCH FLAVORFUL RICE? I'd be very happy with a bottle of water and his plain rice with nothing else. I've seriously never had such tasty rice at any halal cart physical food establishment or anything. It's layered with so much flavor and it's not overpowered with any single spice. Michelin 3 stars Zagat 360 no scope 420 slowly blazed best food in North America dank friggin rice." u'This definitely lives up to the hype. Walk by at least a dozen closer halal stands to go this places on the south west corner of the intersection the most westward one.\nGuys working there are great people and the food is as good as some of the bomb places in Queens. Easily the best one in the city that I know of.'],0.765,0.452,0.548,0.0
182.Zest Szechuan,[u"90% of the time I trust yelp with my life. 10% of the time I can't especially when it comes to more ethnic especially Chinese cuisines.\n\nwhat's the fail proof way to telling if a Chinese restaurant is good? how many Chinese customers are present at any given time. as many yelpers mentioned Zest is almost always PACKED with Chinese customers (seems like there's a lot of international students and ABCs which to me means Zest is doing something right).\n\namazing food service (thank you Lisa!!) and overall dining experience!\n\nps OTGW and Worth It approved - see the vid above ;)" u'Restaurant is a little plain not much decor plenty of tables with a few booths along on wall. I stopped by for lunch and was in and out on thirty minutes.  I walked in close to Noon and the place was not busy.  I did not notice any background music.\n\nBy the time I left the place was packed. Most customers seemed Chinese or other Asians which I take as a good indication.\n\nI had the Kung Pao chicken which was spicy but not too hot.  A good portion.  Could have done with less of the dried red chilies which were chopped up and annoying to separate.\n\nNice place worth a try for a combination of good food at affordable prices. My lunch with entree rice and soup was $9.95 plus tax.  Well worth it for food right out of a wok.\n\nI saw a listing as opening for lunch at 11:00 but that is not accurate.  I stopped by a week ago at 11:30 and the place was not ready for guests.  Which is why I stopped by today at Noon.' u"Overall I had a great experience here. My friends and I were craving some Asian food and came across this place. We ordered the dan dan noodles and the Chong Qing hotpot fish. The dan dan noodles were decent but not amazing. They were just noodles in a spicy and garlicky sauce which I am not opposed to.\n\nThe hot pot fish is brought out to your table in a large rectangular stainless steel tray and is enough to feed 3-4 people. There was a lot of fish in the pot and a bunch of different vegetables to go with it. Of course Szechuan food is chili oil on chili oil and is really heavy so just prepare yourself if you don't eat Szechuan food often. We all ordered a bowl of rice to go with the fish to cut the oil a bit. Neither dish was that spicy and I wish it had a bit more of a kick. I thought the hot pot fish lacked a bit of flavor but it was definitely still really good." u"Honestly this place is just ok !! The hosts here are not very welcoming ! They don't even greet you with a smile ! The person hosting us wouldn't smile or say anything when I asked him for something !! I asked for a bowl and without responding he just walks into his kitchen just comes out and drops it on the table without even looking at you !! While I was ready to go after my meal I stand up to put my jacket and another guy who passes me doesn't even say excuse me just squeezes his way through me !! We ordered schezan shrimp fried rice and crispy thin rice noodle !! Both of them came in with good spice but the fried rice was just bland on the lower portion of it (either they dint mix it well or something )..but given a choice I think I'd choose better places !" u'Very reasonable prices for midtown especially so near Bryant park. Offers hot tea and complimentary fresh orange slices after your meal. \n\nWe had braised ribs with potatoes and dan dan noodles. The braised ribs were delicious and we still had 2/3 of the bowl left with 2 people eating as there was so much food! We finished the dan dan noodles though as that was our appetizer. \n\nOverall large portions and authentic feel. Would definitely come back.' u"Pretty authentic sichuan restaurant in a very centralized location. I really enjoyed the Chong Qing Grilled Fish which is a whole lightly batter fish grilled with variety of veggies including lotus root seaweed mushrooms tofu potato. The dish tends to become oily as it gets more heated at the table but the contents become more flavorful like a dry pot.\n\nThe appetizer are equally tasty and generously portioned. The wife and husband tripe dish is fantastic. The dan dan noodles are on the softer side but good for sharing. \n\nVeggie dishes like snow pea shoots and string bean with minced pork are must haves to balance out the heavy grilled fish. \n\nIt's best to come in a group or more than 2 people to be able to enjoy the family style selections. They take reservations but generally can accommodate for dinner even on a weekend." u'I was super disappointed because the food was almost not spicy or hot at all. Almost no taste of the typical peppercorn in Szechuan cuisine.\n\nOnly the fish hot pot dish had the peppercorns. \n\nWe had the fish soup (which was the best dish in all evening) the twiced cooked pork (underwhelming) the duck (nothing special) cumin lamb (not hot /spicy at all!) string beans (unimpressed) bean curd (no comments) chongqing chicken (not hot and spicy at all) and fish hot pot (a-ok).\n\nI was super disappointed (have to say this again) because a lot of dishes were supposed to be hot/spicy such as chongqing chicken or cumin lamb. It got to the point that we had to ask for extra satay.' u"Amazing Szechuan cuisine! I usually don't get much exposure to good Szechuan food so I was sure glad to discover this gem in Midtown. I came here on a Friday night and found this place to be jam-packed around 8pm which is always a good sign for things to come. The restaurant is clean and simple with various tables and booths to serve many guests. My friend and I were seated quickly and the feast began!\n\nWe started off with the dan dan noodles and wontons in chili sauce. I loved the dan dan noodles! Plenty of noodles with fragrant spicy red sauce mixed in the dish. It was plenty to share between 2-4 people. I also really enjoyed the wontons in chili sauce. The chili sauce was addicting on its own. I could not help but get more and more sauce with each and every bite. As for the wonton I really liked the flavor. It had a nice chew from the wonton skin. Definitely a fan!\n\nAs for the main entrees we first shared to double cooked pork belly. The pork belly was thinly sliced with plenty of cooked-down leeks in the dish. It was definitely a family-style dish plenty to share for a group of friends. The flavoring of the pork was delicious! It paired perfectly with white rice. It had a nice spiciness to it that wasn't overwhelming. \n\nWe also got what seems to be a very popular dish at Zest the Chong Qing Grilled Fish! At $36 this entr\xe9e can feed the whole table on its own. A whole filet of tilapia the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. Super soft and flakey nicely absorbing the spicy sauce in the dish. Not only was there a whole filet of fish there were plenty of pleasant surprise add-ons in the dish including fried tofu lotus root seaweed clear noodles mushrooms (I believe king trumpet mushrooms) and thinly sliced potatoes. A surprise in every bite. I absolutely loved it! It was just as good the next day when we took the remainder home.\n\nOverall a wonderful delicious meal. The service was impeccable regularly filling up our waters and ensuring we were enjoying our time. The atmosphere was comfortable and full of enjoyment with everyone just enjoying their Szechuan dishes.I will definitely be going back just for that fish. Make sure to go earlier rather than later because that fish dish can sell out!" u"Located right by Bryant Park Zest Szechaun is a restaurant specializing in Szechaun cuisine which is typically known for their bold spicy flavors. I was hesitant about trying this place as I can't typically handle this type of spice but they were able to adjust the dish so it was just the right amount of spice that I could enjoy. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the following:\nDan Dan Noodles\nBeef tendon and tripe \nChong Qing Grilled Fish \nChong Qing Rabbit\n\nMy favorites were the Chong Qing Grilled Fish and the Dan Dan Noodles. The grilled fish is definitely the most popular dish to order here as I saw almost all the other tables had an order of it as well. It consists of whole tilapia in a hot chili sauce with peppercorn lotus root mushrooms thinly sliced potatoes seaweed and clear noodles. This is a HUGE dish enough to feed 4 people by itself. The dan dan noodles were a good complement to the fish and I loved how fragrant the dish was. I also have never tried rabbit before and decided to go out of my comfort zone to try it here but ended up not liking it. It tasted like very tough chicken to me and difficult to chew. But at least I can say I've tried it now!\n\nDef recommend if you're looking for some authentic Szechaun cuisine!" u"I had an excellent experience at Zest Szechuan and will definitely be back. \n\nWe started with the Celery and Wood Ear small dish. Wood Ear is my favorite vegetable and this dish was delicious. It was gobbled up quickly. We also had the dan dan noodles which looked a little boring at first. But do not fear! Once we stirred the dish up and mixed around the delicious sauce we enjoyed every single spicy bite. It is definitely a must-try. \n\nThe owner Lisa let us know that her father goes to the market every morning and buys whole fish for the Chong Qing Grilled Fish dishes for the day. When they are out they are out - so make sure to come early! If they don't use all the fish for the day they throw it out because they care about quality and freshness. I highly recommend this dish. At $36 it seems a little pricey but when you see that it can easily feed 2-4 people it really isn't. It satisfies all my hot pot cravings without having to go to Flushing. There is a lot more going on in the dish than just the fish and sauce - there are seaweed knots lotus roots noodles and more. I am craving it more and more as I write this!\n\nWe also tried a dish that I can't remember the name of - but it was basically popcorn chicken with peppers and fried noodles and it was salty and delicious. \n\nFor about $60 bucks for two of us including a beer each we had stuffed ourselves and had a ton of food to take home. The service was awesome - the owner was friendly and explained a lot of the menu to us - and our waters were kept full the whole time - which was good because woooooo there is some spice going on!\n\nHighly highly recommend!" u'Fried pork dumpling were amazing!  Service was fast and thorough. We will definitely make this a staple for anytime we visit NYC.' u"Really authentic yummy Szechuan food! I had just gone to the city SiChuan recently and thought the food here was very comparable to the real thing. \n\nMy bf and I got:\nTendon & tripe (\u592b\u59bb\u80ba\u7247) \nQuarter chicken (\u53e3\u6c34\u9e21)\nSliced fish (\u6c34\u716e\u9c7c) - from their signature dishes menu\nSnow pea leaves (\u7092\u8c46\u82d7) \n\nI personally loved the cold appetizers (first two). I'm also not a big spicy eater myself and Lisa the owner accommodated my need so well! It was just the right amount of spice and tingle. Although the fish looked very spicy since it was swimming in a red broth Lisa assured us that it was just the chili oil color. Those 4 dishes were more than enough for 2 people. I even left with some leftovers :) \n\nOverall service was great. Our food came really fast and we were checked in on consistently with water glasses being constantly filled as well. The owner is really friendly and personable as well! Highly recommend. And I'm def coming back with friends and family!" u"Zest Szechuan is tucked away on 39th between 5th and 6th and it would be easy to walk right by. The bright space is atypical for Chinese restaurants at least those that I've been to in the past. It has a much more modern feel to it. \n\nThe menu is comprised of dishes from the Szechuan region of China where the head chef is from. Those dishes are complimented by Westernized dishes like sesame chicken and General Tso's chicken. If you can tell how authentic a Chinese restaurant is based on whether the patrons are Chinese Zest must be incredibly authentic. The restaurant was almost completely full on a recent Saturday night and my friend and I were the only non-Asian diners. We took that as a great sign!\n\nWe started with the scallion pancakes and pork dumplings both of which were tasty. The pancakes were a bit oily but the soy sauce and vinegar/ginger sauce cut that grease nicely and was a great start to the meal. For dinner my friend and I split the Chong Qing spicy diced chicken and the eggplant with chicken and garlic sauce.  The spicy diced chicken was super crispy and I loved the taste but it would have been nice if some sort of fresh vegetable was included in this dish rather than an abundance of inedible spicy red peppers. The eggplant in the other chicken dish was phenomenal and both my friend and I deemed that one our favorite.  \n\nIt seemed like we were the only table that didn't order the whole fish platter as we saw waiters bringing out large pans of fish and vegetables to nearly every table other than ours. We'll have to try that on our next visit as well as some of the vegetable dishes. For someone who isn't intimately familiar with Chinese cuisine Zest was a great way to try authentic Szechuan cooking with the backup option of ordering Americanized dishes for the less adventurous eater." u"You want authentic chinese food but you don't want to make the trek down to Canal St. Your wish has been granted by the food fairy!\nZest Szechuan brings the authenticity of szechuan food to midtown with clean interiors good service and home made style food. Well deserved addition to the midtown family. \n\nPortions portions portions. When dining here you'll feel like you're being fattened up by your grandmother who is constantly under the impression that you are too skinny. Dishes may seem a tad expensive but most are meant to be shared for at least 2 people.\n\n*Chong Qing Grilled Fish: Best dish in the house. this dish alone deserves 5 stars. Authentic szechuan style whole tilapia in incredible sauce with whole peppercorn red pepper mushroom etc. Perfectly cooked fish the meat literally falls off the bone. For those who are like me and don't like to use your hands to peel of meat away from bone this dish is for you! We looked around the restaurant and about half the table ordered this dish. For 2-3 people if you order this dish alone. \n\n*Chong Qing Chicken: don't underestimate these. AMAZING! It's a dry spiced chicken dish so no wet sauce (ie. kung pao sweet and sour). The cubed chicken is super moist and had the perfect szechuan kick to it. If you want to get a poultry dish but you dont wan't to settle for the Americanized kung pao chicken/orange chicken try chong qing. Not too spicy for the sensitive souls. \n\n*Dan-dan noodle: another popular dish. Super flavorful and a lot of scallions just the way I like it.\n\nNewly opened about a year ago definitely worth a try. If you are craving that ma la style chinese food zest szechuan will be your go to.\nThey have a second floor too great for family gatherings club events." u"This place prides itself on authenticity and freshness and while I can't say that I am an expert in Sichuan cuisine I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the food here. \n\nMy friend and I came around 7PM and the place was pretty crowded. We ordered the fuqi feipian string beans chongqing beef hot pot and dan dan noodles.\n\nFuqi feipian is my absolute favorite Sichuan dish. It is a spicy tripe (was the first cold appetizer listed on the menu) and I was excited to try it. I was a bit nervous that my friend who doesn't like spicy food too much wouldn't enjoy this dish as much as I do. However we both ended up LOVING this dish and it was our favorite out of the four we ordered.\n\nThe dan dan noodles were also amazing! Definitely something I'd recommend ordering if you want something filling yet small. It isn't too spicy and I really like the texture and freshness of the noodles they used. \n\nThe string beans on the other hand were not as good. They were a bit too salty for my taste and very mediocre. If you're looking for a vegetable to order id recommend skipping this one.\n\nFinally the beef hot pot our entree was SO GOOD. I originally wanted the rabbit hot pot but unfortunately they did not have rabbit for the day. The beef was still very good and I can only imagine how good the rabbit would be. Flavouring is very strong and as someone who cannot handle spice too well VERY spicy. There are mushrooms bamboo shoots seaweed knots and other vegetables in the hot pot. The portion size is HUGE and I recommend sharing the entree among 4 people. My friend and I tried to eat it and it was definitely too much. I can say that this dish again was a bit salty. At 40 bucks I'd definitely order the dish for a larger party or you'll end up taking a lot of it home for leftovers. \n\nOverall I'd definitely come to this place again. The freshness of the food and the great balance of spiciness and flavor definitely wowed me." u'If you are looking for authentic Chinese cuisine look no further than Taste of Schezuan. The food and staff reflect real wholesome Chinese cooking. We came here on a Friday right before dinner time and people were flooded in. This is definitely a hot spot for great food.\n\nTo start we ordered the Beef Tendon and Dan Dan Noodles. The beef tendon and tripe is served cold with a light seasoning and delicate flavor. The tripe was cooked perfectly. Dan Dan noodles were soft and bouncy. Pro tip: Mix well! The noodles taste best when you get a bit of the beef and sauce. Though it said the noodles are spicy it is not that spicy. There is a nice heat to it.\n\nFor the main course we ordered doubled cooked pork belly and their famous grilled fish! The pork belly is thinly sliced saut\xe9ed with green onions. It was perfectly seasoned and goes well with the white rice. Tip: They also serve brown rice on the side as well. Lastly their famous grilled fish. The fish comes out bubbling in a huge hot pot dish. The fish is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is served on a bed of bakchoy radish and taro. Needless to say it is the star of the show and for good reason. You must order this dish when you eat here! The entire experience was amazing and well worth it!' u'Highly recommended midtown gem for authentic Szechuan food! \n\nI was invited with a friend by the owner Lisa to try them out and when we went the table was set aside for us in the front and Lisa personally came over to tell us a bit about her restaurant. She was very attentive to what we were looking for and recommended the wonton in chili oil wood ear salad chong qing spicy fish hotpot and chong qing spicy chicken washed down with a cold glass of beer. \n\n1. Atmosphere - Place it nice and bright with just enough space to not feel too crowded nor low-energy. It was a weekday lunch and the place was packed! If it weren\'t for the special case reservation we would\'ve had to wait for probably 15 minutes. \n\n2. Service - Lisa set the tone and the serving staff were really friendly. Though given the occasion maybe they were a bit TOO forward/friendly (^^;) as they kept coming every 10-15 minutes asking how is the food or whether we needed anything. I think the third time was the charm... but not the 4th 5th 6th and 7th time... =P \n\n3. Food - \na. Appetizer - I didn\'t expect it but I loved the wonton in chili sauce - i mean it\'s hard to go wrong with this dish but the sauce was light with just the right amount of spicy high tone and subtle sweet body. Lisa recommended the wood ear salad which I found was savory but perhaps not distinguished as its texture was a bit too soft with not enough bite... and I know my wood ear! \nb. Main course - Chong qing fish came in all its splendid get-up and overall was satisfying in its amount of ingredient. Fish was moist and flaky so I commented to Lisa about its freshness. However I found that the other accompanying ingredients like fu zhu lotus root etc. were a bit hastily prepared because lotus root was pretty meh (no crunchy bite slightly undercooked) and fu zhu likewise was a bit undercooked so it failed to fulfill its part in a hot pot dish acting as the sauce sponge bursting with Szechuan flavor. Chong qing chicken was an interesting dish with moist chicken and right amount of spice. I found the rice twist cracker(?) a bit confusing as I wasn\'t sure how it added to the dish. I probably would\'ve preferred something that soaks what little sauce there is better than this rice stick thingy that kinda did its own thang just a-chillin\'. \n\nSo overall the whole experience was pleasant with on-point dishes that may just need slight more attention here and there to get to "Great". I for one love these authentic gems making themselves more available to the everyday American diners (who definitely don\'t know what authentic Chinese is) and would strongly recommend anyone wanting to explore the beauty of Szechuan cuisine to check it out without hesitation.  I will definitely go back to try the spicy tendon dan dan noodle and other goodies for sure. \n\nThanks Lisa and go show some love @ Zest Szechuan Yelpers!' u"This restaurant specializing in Szechuan food is located not far from Bryant Park with convenient access to via subway. There are ample amounts of tables and booths for large parties within the space and when we came during lunch were immediately seated. \n\nWe had ordered their speciality Chong Qing grilled fish the Chong Qing spicy diced chicken as per recommendation fungus salad and the dan dan noodles which is a must at any Szechuan restaurant. The grilled fish was served in a large platter that could feed way more than a party of 2. My favorite was definitely the diced chicken because it was so crispy and flavorful from the spices. My tolerance for spice isn't very high so the chicken was great! It looked spicy but it wasn't. The fungus salad was very refreshing and light balancing out the other heavy dishes. \n\nService was really good and attentive as well. Lisa was so nice!" u"Wow I have just found a gem in the busy streets of NY today. Being from Toronto I have my fill of authentic tasting Chinese food. However I was blow away from the amazing tasting dishes I had today! I ordered the grilled fish and the pig feet in dry pot. The fish was their most popular dish and it certainly tasted like it! What surprise me was the pig feet. OMG I was just blown away from the tender and delicious meat. The meat actually falls from the bone no joke lol! I have almost been to all the legit tasting restaurants around the Toronto area and I'm still amazed at the taste of this restaurant. Definitely and I mean definitely come and give them a go you won't regret it! \n\nP.s. I heard that seeing Chinese celebrities at this restaurant isn't a rare occasion" u'Super authentic Chinese food. I I got think what is really worth noting is that both more traditional sichuan spicy dishes and the more bland dishes are pretty good. I ordered fish fillet w/ soft tofu pudding \u8c46\u82b1\u9c7c\u7247 and baby Napa in chicken broth soup \u6d53\u6c64\u5a03\u5a03\u83dc to even it off. I was kind of worried that the soup will be too bland coz it is not a Shanghaiese place but it is actually surprisingly good! \n\nThe service here is really nice too. I was waiting for a friend who was late for about 1.5 hours because of crazy NY traffic. The staff not only did not express any negative emotions but they heated the food for us when my friend came. I left extra tip lol. \n\nHighly recommend!'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
80.John’s of Times Square,[u"A great place for pizza beer and d\xe9cor in the Times Square area.  I specify in the Times Square area because there are two establishment with the same name.  Well you can't order just a slice but need to order a whole pie and the beer cold and tasty.  Being by myself I ordered a small cheese pizza and a pint of the local Brooklyn ale.  The small pizza is actually pretty big consisting of six slices so I took half of the pizza home to eat later. \nAs others have noted the restaurant is a refurbished church so there are evidence of it's original purpose stained windows.  \nThere are many options in Manhattan for pie and beer.  John's is definitely on top of the list." u"In the heart of The times Square. Lovely Victorian designed building. Nice and dim you can visibly see the beautiful 2 Brick ovens. \nAlthough this place feels homey the pricing and selection of pizzas didn't add up. There's only 4-5 pizzas to choose from. All are which basic pizzas. The only one that offered Meat was the Hawaiian. To add extra toppings it's around 4-4.50 each. No deluxe no pepperoni no Meat lovers every topping is an extra 4 bucks. \nHowever I ordered the Small Traditional add Pepperoni and mushroom which was $25. It was really good. Thin crust authentic tasting mozzarella cheese. Also a small order of wings $9." u"Pizza and garlic knots were excellent and delicious!  The only reason for a 4 Star is that it's a little on the slower side for service.  Not terrible service we had a great waitress. I would really give it 4.5 if I could.\n\nWe got a traditional pie with pepperoni and sausage.  Those garlic knots were epic!!" u"I love Johns.  I have eaten here many times.  I overlook the fact that the service is not very attentive.  Mostly ever. \n\nHowever tonight was bad.  We ordered the fried mozzarella appetizer and it came out with a side of marinara.  In an effort to share a large appetizer one person in our party tried to pass the clear glass sauce cup.  It slipped and boiling hot sauce spilled on her hand causing serious first and second degree burns.  It was bad.  I have no idea why sauce needs to be so hot. \n\nWe got no apology from the server.   Not a single expression of concern from the first manager who brought a bag of ice - after we asked.  Finally the second manager made a bunch of excuses and he did apologize.  Unfortunately it was a little too late at that point to make anyone feel better.  No break on the bill either of course.\n\nThe food was great but the caring for the customers was seriously lacking.  I can't look past that anymore." u'John\'s on 44th is a huge operation being located in the heart of Broadway making it the perfect casual place to stop and get a meal before or after a show.  We came here at 3pm on a Wednesday and it was very busy.  We were seated right away but not many tables were available for an off time and it being a huge place.  The waiter took our order rather quickly with my one daughter ordering chicken fettucine alfredo and the other one splitting a Margherita pizza with me.  They do not serve pizza by the slice and they play that up pretty big with their waiters wearing t-shirts saying "whole pies only" on the back.  \n\nThe chicken alfredo came out 1st and my daughter said the texture of the chicken tasted weird.  Our pizza came out next both of which came out very fast.  The pizza was only luke warm.  My guess is they cook up a ton of them and they sit until someone orders it then they give it a quick reheat in the oven.  The crust was perfectly thin and crisp but the sauce was a little too thin.  \n\nIt\'s a solid pie but there are definitely better in NYC.  If you have time venture out of Times Square and you\'ll find better if you are in a hurry John\'s will work though.' u"30 years ago when it was hard to find a neopolitan brick oven pizza John's of Bleecker Street was an oasis: thin charred crust sparingly dotted with super-fresh ingredients. It was a destination in and of itself and worth waiting in a long line to get a table.\n\nNowadays neopolitan pizza isn't so rare and John's has a monster-sized Times Square location. The pizza's still terrific and an outstanding value compared to most midtown restaurants. I just wouldn't call it a destination worth waiting an hour for anymore.\n\nHighly recommended for a value-priced meal in Times Square especially if it's an off-hour with no waiting. \n\nGet your pizza simple but with strong flavors: maybe a little garlic and onion or garlic and fresh sausage." u'DH was set to visit this place on our last day in NYC so I gave in. \n\nPizza is ok although I could just be saying that after 5 days of eating out (I\'m usually a health nut!). DH thought the pizza was ok didn\'t stop him from eating his half though! Crust not thick nor thin. We got a "small" that  "small" pizza could feed a family of 6!!\n\n Could crank up the AC it felt warm inside. Pricey place!\n\nWe probably won\'t remember this place.' u"Picked up pizza after a dinner with friends (tapas are not a meal). Pizza was amazing. Sauce was not overly spicy and the sausage was not over cooked. So happy with our random pizza choice. We ordered and picked up and didn't have to wait long. Perfect foldable pizza. Great place for a quick to-go order!" u"This place is amazing! I didn't have the pizza but it looked really delicious! I had the pasta and the wings and they were amazing. The pasta was the chicken Alfredo and it was to die for the service was amazing they took us right in no wait time and the food came out quickly and the only reason I know that is because we only had 30 minutes before our broadway musical." u"Went into this location on a whim as we wanted to grab some lunch before the show. And oh my gosh what a treat. The foot was delicious. Possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust was perfect and the sauce great. Also the atmosphere is great. The place itself is beautiful." u"New York style pizza is hotly contested against Chicago style pizza and this place's offering kind of loosely represents New York.\n\nHow so? Well if you're a tourist and thought prices were sky high even a native New Yorker like myself finds it absurd that a large (normal) round pie starts at $22. Add toppings and you'll find yourself scratching your head at how anyone could spend that much for a slice when you break it down.\n\nThe service was okay and the waitress was cordial and pleasant. The former church has a huge mural of the city which was also pleasant but the place overall was a bit dark. I felt like I was dining romantically with my two coworkers during lunch munching and critiquing on pizza.\n\nThe thin crust pizza was good with the typical crispy-on-outside-chewy-on-the-inside texture we all know and love. Thank goodness for the lower levels of calcium carbonate and magnesium in NYC water! At least they got that right.\n\nHowever the margherita pie with toppings was mediocre as the sauce was bland and flavor less. The chicken and mushroom toppings sparsely populated the pie and was unfortunately dry.\n\nIf you want to judge NYC pizza by this place please don't. There are so many other awesome pizza joints in the city. I'm not judging this place by only coming here once but my wallet can't take this kind of abuse." u"You aight.  We came here because my hunny and I like pizza.  Also we always hear it advertised on the radio.\n\nService-very mediocre.  It was chilly inside and our waitress wasn't friendly.  She did her job but we almost felt like we were bothering her.  \n\nDecor-it's plain.  The area in the back is dark-seems like a food hall.  The front is nicer but our booth looked worn and dirty.  \n\nWe began with wings and a Caesar salad.  The wings were meaty and good.  It came with celery but no carrots.  The Caesar salad was large.  It was so cold which makes me assume it was pre made and waiting on the fridge.  It was a creamy dressing that lacked flavor.  The pizza was okay for a $24 pie.  I got garlic on it which added some flavor but overall it didn't have much flavor.  I liked the thickness of the pizza.  \n\nThe menu stated that they don't give free soda refills.  This went along with the overall cold vibe I felt here on a Sunday afternoon around 3.\n\nWould we return?  Probably not." u"Pretty good pizza - I got a half traditional/half margherita and the traditional was definitely better. However service was slow and the small pizza was $20 so be prepared to pay a lot for an average-sized pizza. Also you can't order slices: whole pies only." u"I don't feel I'm qualified to fairly judge pizza. I've put some world class pizza in my mouth so nothing ever lives up. It was decent pizza though. The service was pretty slow and we were never offered refills. I thought I was gonna have to sic snapping turtle on him aka miss cookie dough aka lover of dry aka the girlfriend." u"This place was DELICIOUS. My service though sucked. I'm not going to call out my server name but he sucked. I ordered a pizza 6 wings and mozzarella triangles. The server looked at my party of two and goes umm I think you guys ordered to much food. We were a little baffled on why he would say that. \n\nWould recommend this place but the service sucks." u"This restaurant was one of the highlights of my NYC trip. It's been almost a month and I'm still dreaming of the perfectly crisp fried mozzarella and the fresh sausage on my pizza. Seriously...my mouth is watering just writing this review. \n\nIt seems my group of 5 were the lucky ones as we walked in and were sat down right away (though it did look like there were quite a few people waiting). The ambience is nice- dim house lights and fairy lights add an intimate feel while the bar area managed to keep it a big casual. We ordered garlic knots and fried mozzarella as our appetizers but everything on the menu sounded good. No complaints there. The garlic knots tasted of fresh garlic and were filled with cheesy goodness and the fried mozzarella made a Instagram-worthy cheese pull. Three of us shared the smallest sized pizza with pepperoni sausage and extra cheese. One of the best pizzas I've had. Not greasy not flimsy and could be eaten with hands or a fork (classy). \n\nThe only negatives were the chicken fettuccine alfredo that came out cold and bland and the dry service. I think our waiter smiled at us once between mumbled words. But I can look past that because everything else was amazing and I'll definitely make this restaurant a must every time I visit NYC." u"We came here based on must visit places in the Broadway district.  So happy we did!! \nTo start.. it was a Friday night at 6pm no reserve. It was packed full in the lobby/bar area. Hey no worries.  The guy behind the bar was ready to take our order! Beer and a midori sour coming up! Great heavy pours so don't sweat how much it will cost.  It's worth it! 15 min wait and we were right in the beautiful dining under that famous old stainless.  Our server recommend the Vodka pasta and it was incredible! The sauce was so ridiculously good that we were lathering up our perfectly roasted pizza crust in it. We ordered the traditional pizza with added pepperoni and bacon.  Sheer heaven.  Great attentive service too. Calamari was cooked perfect! Give it a shot.. and you'll fall in love too." u"WOW. This place is nice with the decorbar guy was friendly and served cold beers for our wait on a table. We ordered a pizza on the well side. It was perfect. Looking at the picture on their wall of NYC. People hustling to serve it's people. Beer was a Sam Adamspizza was pepperoni. We enjoyed it very much. Now for the down side it's a bit loud. Overall we came back had the ravaloi and spaghetti. Wine list was not too bad either. They had a Columbia Crest Cab. Could not eat it alland gave the next table the rest of our wine bottle. Good things to pay it forward. I should have picked up a t-shirtmaybe next time when we are there again and yes we will come back." u"I really enjoyed my second experience at John's. Though known for being touristy I think it's for good reason. I've seen some negative comments on the service but that was not my experience at all. The hostess was very nice and asked us if we wanted to change tables after she seated a large family next to us. We didn't - we had a great balcony view of the church interior. Our server was also helpful and guided us away from ordering two pizzas because it would have been too much food. The pizza bianca came highly recommended by a friend so I got that and the large amounts of ricotta did not disappoint. Great crust too. The other items I got were somewhat average - undercooked broccoli and average sangria. But stick to pizza and you won't be disappointed." u"Dodged into this place after a long flight in fighting traffic all the way tired and starving...but was soon to regret...\nAs far as their pizza goes it was mediocre at best! \nDry cracker-like pizza..zero olive oil taste less...so disappointing!\n..I'm a nyorker I know good pizza!\nNot good and the prices were quite high. We spent over $50 for a small pizza (to share )and a salad. Scandalous!!!....won't be returning  and cannot reccommend."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
196.Mémé Mediterranean,[u"This has become one of my go-to brunch places in mid-town west! I wish I had discovered this sooner! I've been here a handful of times now and everything that me or my friends have ordered have been delicious! I also love how they have an outdoor patio so I have been able to bring my dog with me for brunch each time. Service here is also excellent and everyone is super friendly and attentive. \n\nI love the chicken skewers and the meme brunch. Definitely try out this brunch place if you're in the area or even if you're not it will be worth the trip!" u"Brunch. Brunch. Brunch.\n\nThings to note:\n1) Reservations are available through Open Table\n2) Seating for 2 and round tables for like 8\n3) Intimate and decent service\n4) Must must get the Combo Vegetarian Platter to Share. The roasted beets carrots hummus falafel with pita is delicious\n5) Very good jam/butter offerings\n6) Coffee is great but I wished they had dairy-free creamer options. This is NYC where the hell is my cashew milk?!\n7) Ahi Tuna Salad is delicious\n8) Egg White Fritta is okay and the sweet potato fries stood out more. \n9) Lots of patio seating when there is no NYC Rain\n10) Top shakshuka in the city\n\nI can't speak for dinner but if you need a solid brunch with a variety of options and excellence service while not waiting in line for hours - come here!" u'Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a Sunday night. We were able to snag the last table outside which was great.\n\nAfter perusing the menu I decided to go with the chicken tagine. This dish was totally fine--chicken was tender it was a decent size--but it just lacked any sort of flavor. The textures were definitely there but I could hardly tell what was in the dish because it turned out to be very soupy and bland.\n\nNevertheless the wait staff was very friendly and the food came out quickly. In addition the outside patio makes for a great atmosphere for dining especially on a warm summer night.' u"The complimentary olive bread and dips were very good. The pickled olives and vegetables in particular were top notch. \n\nWe had three tapas between the two of us - bless the waitress for telling us that 3 between 2 is a good size. Got the hummus (with falafel) Polenta with halumi cheese and the truffle gnocchi. The polenta was very well made with a nice complementing tomato topper and the cheese was fried in little cubes adding to the texture and flavor. The gnocchi was like soft pillows in a creamy sea. The portion size was just right else it would've been overwhelming. \n\nThe hummus and falafel were meh - the falafel was a tad dry and under seasoned. Won't get these the next time we're here. \n\n\nOverall - good food and service and will be back again!" u'Service was a bit slow but food was pretty good. My favorite was actually the complimentary bread with olive oil. I ordered the octopus salad which was pretty good...If you are looking for  something on the lighter side. \n\nBe careful it is a bit cold inside the restaurant. Make note of the air ducts and try to get seated away from the air vents if you are sensitive to cold temperatures.' u"What an amazing place!!! The food has left us speechless!!! So fresh and unique. The amazing spices and the flavor fills every dish. If you're in the mood for a good quality Middle Eastern and Israeli food then look no further!!! Outstanding service from the moment we were greeted at the door to the waiter who was extremely caring and has suggested a few dishes to order. Will definitely be back!!!!" u'Ended up eating here due to the heavy rain. It was rather empty in the AM and we were seated promptly. They provided two types of brunch menu - one was more "entree"-centric while the other was more "brunch"-centric. We both opted for the latter as neither of us was hungry and would like to try something smaller.\n\nI loved my shakshuka - my easy-cooked egg was marinated perfectly well with the tomato sauce! Pita was also soft and chewy. My friend got the Mediterranean pancake - very different from the traditional American one for sure! It was similar to the middle eastern bread which can be eaten with hands. They matched the "pancake" with the sliced egg pieces hmm interesting! \n\nHighlight was definitely the latte. As a regular latte-drinker I would rank it at least within top 5 if not top 3 - the espresso was balanced and carried a slight nutty flavor. Well done!' u"Great dinner at Meme. Had the hummus appetizer brussels sprouts small plate chicken kebab and the two way lamb entree. All incredible- I highly recommend the two way lamb and chicken kebab. I didn't really feel the hummus to be worth $13 and I prefer the brussels sprouts at District Tap House (so not worth $8 either).\n\nWe asked to be moved and the manager addressed the issue promptly by moving us across the room- not like it really mattered because the kid was SHRIEKING and could be heard across the room.\n\nDear parents please leave your kids at home on a Friday night unless they are well-behaved. I don't want to hear your adorable kid scream nor does the screaming really add to the ambience of eating mediterranean tapas (and spending a lot of money to do so). Of course this is based on the understanding that I am a very cranky and pretentious individual that considers atmosphere to be a huge component of a great meal. Go to a family place or a restaurant that has a kid's menu and thank you for ruining my date." u"Excellent falafel and lamb burgers.   Comfy with great service.  Perfect for the late lunch crowd.  Can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu." u"Such a great neighborhood gem! Place is cute and outdoor space nice & shady. Staff are so friendly and the food is fabulous!! \nToday we had brunch. I had MeMe's Breakfast. Scrambled eggs cooked to perfection. Hubby had MeMe Brunch ... wonderful platter of French Toast Mini Bagel with Salmon Herbed Scrambled Eggs & Greek Yogurt with Granola & Fresh Berries.... simply Delish!!!\nMeMe starts you off with Warm Fresh raisin bread and mini corn muffins. An Aperol and a Sangria started our Sunday morning ... Heaven" u"Had a wonderful lunch here and can't wait to come back!\n\nI ordered the chopped salad and it tasted super delish and fresh. I loved the lemon vinaigrette and soft pita on the side. The chicken was sliced thin and tasted good. My co-workers ordered the hummus veggie pita and Moroccan brunch. Both enjoyed their meals." u"This restaurant is a huge No-Go. Came here for dinner with my parents because I wanted to take them somewhere farther from all the noise and commotion on 9th Ave. They basically got one star for their olive oil and for their service otherwise they would have been a zero star. The tapas are all $14/$16 and the entrees hover around $24-$30. I ordered the moussaka which I usually love but their mousakka here is tomato based so it's just like eggplant Parmesan. So for $14 you get a tiny ceramic dish worth of eggplant Parmesan (moussaka). My dad got a chicken entree and the chicken wasn't fresh. Just poor quality and overpriced restaurant. I would stay away. I've been hugely disappointed by most of the restaurants around my neighborhood :(" u"Great service and good food - only down side are the portions of each plate.\n\nWasn't too happy that each plate could literally feed 1 one person :/ \n\nBest to go in group of 3 - the dishes come out with 3 pieces of meat/fish (odd amount)" u"A few years ago I used to go to the other location in the Village regularly and Meme has always been my go-to recommendation for people who want to try Mediterranean food. I don't know if the Hell's Kitchen location menu/restaurant is really different or if Meme in general has just gone down in quality but I am really disappointed and am now in need of a new go-to Mediterranean restaurant.\n\nMade a reservation in the morning for a table of 3 in the evening. We got there 8 minutes late and they said they had given our table away and to expect a 20 minute wait. I understand we shouldn't have been late but wow that's a strict policy - most restaurants give a 15 minute courtesy so that was very off putting. We decided to eat at the bar and then 10 minutes later they move us to a table. But anyway all of this is not why I think this place deserves 2 stars although it did make for a bad introduction to the restaurant.\n\nThe food ... was just bland to not good. I ordered the couscous and it was really meh. I don't know how to describe it other than blah. Dinner came out to about 30 something per person including tax and tip and we didn't order drinks or appetizers - for meh food I think that's pretty overpriced and not worth it. There's better restaurants in Hell's Kitchen and now I need a new Mediterranean go to place." u"On the way to a concert at Terminal 5 I was searching for a restaurant in the Hell's Kitchen area and I was pleased to discover Meme Mediiterranean! The restaurant was cute had some outdoor space and delicious food.\n\nI was with my parents and we started with the Combination Platter to get a great sampling of babaganoush hummus beets tabouli falafel matbucha carrots and roast peppers ($18). It was sizable and gave us a opportunity to sample manny items. I loved the roast peppers and babaganoush.\n\nWe also split the Laffa Taco ($12) and Moussaka ($12). The Laffa taco was interesting and chicken schawarma was tender and tasty. The Moussaka was piping hot and absolutely amazing. I also had a glass of red wine that was good but their food and service sealed the deal. I would certainly come back to this restaurant especially before seeing a show at Terminal 5. Next time I would love to try the Black Mission Figs and the Baked Meatballs!" u"Great local Mediterranean spot with outdoor seating. Food is fresh and tasty. The standout dishes were the saut\xe9d wild mushroom (probably our favorite) soft parmesan polenta the lamb two ways pan roasted salmon and the duck breast. The meatball and halibut was ok and seafood grill suffered from an overlooked salmon (not surprised since it's grilled with scallops). Great atmosphere and overall enjoyable restaurant!" u'Great food great service just love this place.\nDuck breast is awesome\nDefinitely gonna come back again' u'We arrived by accident and afterwards could not believe our good luck!\n\nWe had seven in our party and were on the hunt for brunch. Our original spot fell through but they directed us here and swore it was "lovely." We walked by looked at the menu then wandered in. First of all the space is beautiful. Bright clean artfully decorated. They quickly put two tables together for us and each one had a sweet floral arrangement that looked hand-picked. Then they brought out complimentary bread butter and jam (all of which looked and tasted like it had been made in-house.) These little touches were the start of an excellent meal.\n\nI had the house-made chicken sausage with salsa verde over-easy eggs and butternut squash/green apple hash. Heaven! I\'m still thinking about how I can replicate it at home. The flavors came together so beautifully. Several in our party had the french toast made from thick-cut slices of brioche. It was so decadent few could finish. \n\nThe service was also wonderful. Our waitress and the manager (or perhaps owner?) made sure that we had everything we needed. It\'s a miracle they were able to accommodate us when they did as the place quickly filled up. Still we never fell to the way-side! \n\nAfterwards with full bellies we all remarked what a wonderful meal it was. Would come back!' u'Service - 9\nFood - 10\nDrinks - 9\nAmbience - 9\n\nThe food here is amazing. We tried four dishes and two appetizers and they were absolutely delicious!\n\nDefinitely a place to try out.' u"Wonderful new spot in Hell's Kitchen with a great atmosphere for brunch time. Seating under an awning outside and many open tables inside Saturday morning. Greeted by a friendly host as we looked through the menu.\n\nFree bread to start is always a plus - served with butter balls and fruit preserve. For food we shared the Shakshuka ($15) and Melawach ($15). Shakshuka had three poached eggs floating in a thick tomato broth with pitas along the edges. Flavorful broth and a huge portion - wish they had more pita to dip into the meal. Melawach has amazing hummus on top of a hearty crisp pancake that doesn't leave you overly full. For drinks we had the Bloody Mary ($8) and Aperol ($8) which are both strong and made well.\n\nService here is fantastic; server was kind and kept checking up on us and the water was constantly refilled. Like that it's open early don't like that it takes an hour siesta in the middle of the day (can't blame them too much). Will certainly come back for brunch again."],0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0
155.Joe’s Pizza,[u"My husband and I went to New York for our honeymoon. Our mission? Find the best New York pizza and indulge as much as possible. Well we found this high expectation in Joe's. \n\nOn our honeymoon we tried 5-6 different joints but at the end of the day Joe's beat them all. We had Joe's EVERY NIGHT of our week long honeymoon. I think one of the cashiers started recognizing us because we were becoming regulars!\n\nThe reason why Joe's is so good is because for me the sauce. It's bright in the mouth and you can taste the beauty of the tomatoes and spices. The crust is thin and crispy. My favorite slice to get was the fresh mozz. The slices aren't very filling I usually eat about 2-3 while my husband can pack 5 of them in one sitting. It is a little pricey but for the NYC experience well worth it. I believe the fresh mozz was $3.50 per slice. It might sound steep but it truly is worth it. The $1 slices spotted around NYC is ok but very greasy and just not as good as Joe's. Coming from someone who is careful with how their money is spent I'll tell you right now that this was worth all the money and more. \n\nThe various times we've come here the line hasn't been long. Another plus of this establishment. If the line is a bit long they run through the line quick. The workers here are efficient and good at managing big crowds. There aren't many places to sit so I've always taken my order to go. It was convenient though because my hotel the Hampton Inn on 41st was like a 3 minute walk. \n\nMe and my husband just want to say THANK YOU JOE'S PIZZA for making our NYC experience perfect and giving us a taste of what real NYC pizza should be like." u"I threw out the slice I bought. \n\nIt was pepperoni. They use the big and flat ones which are greasy and lacking a really good meaty/spicy taste. The sauce has an oddly sweet vitamin/sweetener aftertaste as well. Bottom was pretty burned too. Won't go back. We deserve a better quality slice for the price." u'Bumped into Joe\'s because i was in Times Sq and it was getting late and i was starving like a maniac. Saw the bright light coming from this place and i was like "ah the heck i\'m gonna go in and grab a slice". And i did not regret it.\n\nYes $3 seems like a steep price tag to pay for a slice of cheese pizza but it\'s better than the dollar pizza nearby. It was not greasy and oily and the flavor was well balanced. I know it is sorta hard to adjust especially if you are used to the thicker slice one.\n\nthey have plenty of other selections but of course it is much more expensive than the cheese slice. I\'ll def go back to try the mozzarella and sicilian slice. Funny enough that when my bus passed by their Bedford av location in Brooklyn couple months ago i told to myself that i\'m gonna stop by at Joe\'s one day to try their pizza. Ha!' u"Look it was good pizza I just expected more. Definitely crowded with plenty of choices but I can't classify it as great!\n\nCrust was actually tough in some places and made it hard to eat. Staff was decent." u"Wow.... I'm all about pizza (especially in midtown) but to my surprise this pizza is is really good! \n\nI got there  around 12:30 and the line was out the door. Moved pretty fast which was a plus. All the pizzas were fresh coming out of the oven and lots of helpful folks taking orders. \n\nThere's limited seating. Most folks eat while standing up using the tables in the center of the room. You can try grabbing a stool if one is available.\n\nThe pizza it's thin perfect amount of tasty sauce and cheese. It wasn't greasy which for me shows the cheese they used is good quality cheese.\n\nMy favorite pizza spot for lunch! Will be going back" u'Pizza was great but not the best we\'ve had. No bathrooms though and its pretty dirty. Not meant to be a "sit down" eating establishment. We spent $50 on 5 slices and 3 drinks. The hype is definitely the celebrities on the wall and their history not so much the location or pizza.' u'The regular cheese pizza was great in terms of taste. The crust is done perfectly at this place. I thought the mozzarella slice was not as good a little bland. \n\nPrices are not bad service is alright but the wait was about 10 mins for them to heat up the slices. \n\n\nFood: 4/5\nValue: 3.75/5\nService: 3.5/5\nOverall: 3.75/5' u'Late late last night I decided to stop here because I wanted some authentic New York pizza. Yelp did not fail me! \n\nThe pizza slices are huge and the people are very nice. The place I originally wanted to go was closed but this place stays open very late and I love it! I had a little distance to walk so they gave me a pizza box and some crushed red pepper per my request. \n\nThe pizza was amazing minus the crust. The crust was pretty hard and had a few bits that tasted like burnt dough. I do not know if this is the style here or anything but I did eat it anyways. The sauces and cheese was delicious and surprisingly good despite how thin it is. I had a good experience!' u"Good pizza! Had a pepperoni slice and a white cheese slice. Really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza! White was good but I've had better. I wasn't expecting much in time square but pleasantly surprised. You will not be disappointed." u"I was pleasantly surprised with my NY pizza experience here. The place wasn't crowded but didn't disappoint with the flavor and amazing crust! It was a traditional thin crust that had a nice char on the bottom. \n\nUpon ordering a slice of pepperoni pizza ($4) they popped it into the oven to be enjoyed crispy and hot! I bought an additional water bottle from the fridge ($1.50) and was readily rung up. \n\nThey have a bunch of squeeze bottles with red pepper cheese oregano and garlic powder to add on your slice if you wish. You can enjoy your slice whilst looking at walls filled with pictures of famous people visiting Joe's! :D" u"One of my fears is that Joe's Pizza will turn into another Ray's (or Famous Ray's or Original Famous Ray's or Ray's Famous Original etc.).  I'm happy to say that Joe's latest outpost in the Times Square area keeps up the tradition of great pizza served quickly.\n\nIf you've been to other Joe's (I've been to the ones on Carmine St. and East 14th St.) you'll get the same here.  You'll have to wait on a line but the line moves quickly.  There are some stools along the window but if you eat there there is a good chance you'll be standing up.  And the end product is definitely worth the line.  Also since there are many customers the pizza turnover is quick and your odds of getting a hot fresh out-of-the-oven slice for lunch are quite good.\n\nBest of all this latest location is a short walk from my office so I have a new lunch venue!!!" u"The Times Square food situation keeps getting better and better now with a new Joe's.\n\nIt's just like the other locations but is a bit bigger than the rest. They have the same great slices so it's definitely one of the best food options around here now even though Rock Pizza Scissors is only a block away too. Now tourists can get an actually good New York slice around here." u"My office is across the street from this place. Joe's Pizza opened up in Abitino's old spot when they went out of business a few months ago. \n\nI've never been to their other locations but this place is LEGIT. It's easily one of the best if not THE best pizza by the slice spots I've ever been to in NYC. The crust is thin and perfectly burnt the ratio of cheese sauce and dough is spot on. It doesn't get much better than this. \n\nCheese slices are $3 (tax included) -- so a bit high but delicious. I've tried almost all of the spots in midtown and this is hands down the best in the area." u"Amazing pizza if you're visiting NYC go here! Great quality and fast service. First time having NY pizza and I loved it. Caprese is awesome I also got the white pizza yumm and great place to people watch" u"Once a week late night! Our pizza spot!! Just got our team there for a late night event dinner everybody loves it. I've previously met James spader in the carmaine street one. \n\nNo celebrity so far but awesome pizza each time! Think the guys there know me already!" u"I'm a fan of Joe's pizza! I don't think I'd go as far as to say Joe's is the best pizza in NYC like all the celebrities lining the walls do but it's not as bad as some of my friends made it out to be. It's surprisingly very good! My favorite thing about it is that the crust has a nice crunch to it. Even the tomato-lined pizza had a crunchy crust and tomato notoriously makes pizzas soggy. We got three slices tonight - one supreme one with mozzarella tons of tomatoes and basil and one margherita. The margherita was my favorite but all of them were delicious! I'll definitely check it out again when I'm craving a slice!" u"Came for the pizza but I spent the majority of my time checking out the wall of photos of the owners with numerous celebrities. He's seem to have met just about everyone. But more about the food. I had a slice of pepperoni for about $3. The Pizza itself tasted good only con is the crust was a little burnt but tasty nonetheless." u'Great pizza -- one of the best slices I\'ve had in NYC.  $3-4.75/slice which is substantially over the "standard" NYC pizza price but well worth it.  Crispy thin crust flavorful sauce (without being so much as to be messy and classic toppings -- I had pepperoni and supreme and I\'d say the supreme was better but both were very good.  The white pizza is what I\'d try next time.' u"I can't explain why but this pizza is DELISH! I am not a fan of thin pizza but since this was a new place and half a block from my work I took a chance and I got hooked!!!\n\nI tried all toppings they offered and the plain pizza still the best for me. The secret is the sauce guys -- It reminds me my childhood going to the authentic Italian Pizzeria in the corner Street.\n\nThe atmosphere is also very cool and the staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong with a $3 dollars slice in the  heart of Times Square." u"Joe's Pizza came highly recommended from friends. We stopped by around 11PM and there was a line out the door! It wasn't the fastest line but the food was hot and delicious. Their cheese is $3 with topping $4 is slightly high as I'm use to the $1.50 giant slice of pizza from Costco. \n\nThe slices are large and they're thin and crispy. Slices are fresh and hot. I highly recommend trying a slice if you're in the area!"],0.474,0.278,0.722,0.0
137.Dafni Greek Taverna,[u'Very good option in this touristic hood. A very friendly affordable oasis.\nI had the arugula salad & the greek yogurt .\nPerfect!' u'I came for lunch had the three course special for $29. Skip the salad not that great  salad dressing too vinegary not a fan.\nI had sea bass it was excellent and veggies flavorful . The portion however was ridiculously small.\nDessert was baklava  a little too hard for my taste but three pieces.\nWine was good picked by waiter.\nService was excellent table was comfortable.' u"I don't write many reviews especially negative ones. But I am because I'm astounded at the ratings it has.\n\nWe had chicken souvlaki and it was dry over cooked with almost no flavoring. The tzatziki sauce was good and the potatoes were good.\n\nService wasn't good at all they were unfriendly to the point that we started wondering if we were dressed wrong because that's how unwanted we felt.\n\nWhen I brought up to her nicely that the chicken was dry she didn't even acknowledge it.\n\nI don't care much for service if the food is good but I know most people are up in arms if a waitress blinks wrong. So it's shocking to see their reviews as it was almost the worst chicken souvlaki I've ever had and service was probably bottom 25%. Maybe I got unlucky but I suggest not looking at the stars the price is absurdly high too. Would be fine if it was even ok. Not even close unless chef was off today........" u'A lovely atmosphere friendly and caring service.  Two of the three wines we had were inexpensive and wonderful.  The Octopus appetizer was really delicious as well.   All this buys the first two stars.  However the bread and gigantes (beans) were okay but nothing special.  The main course the branzino (fish) was dry without much flavor and disappointing.\n\nDinner for two (three appetizers one entree one bottle + two glasses of wine) was $120 (tax inclusive).' u'A beautiful setting great food and fast services sums it up for this Greek restaurant.\nI have the Greek salad with gyros on top for dinner followed by baklava for dessert.\n\nThe salad was fresh and the gyros was full of taste and juicy. The baklava was just right not too drenched with sauce and no to dry. It was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. \n\nThe service was impeccable. If you are looking for Greek food give it a try.' u'Good wine and nosh. We happened to be in the area.  The spreads and zucchini fritters were great. Noise level is low enough that you can have a conversation but loud enough that you do not feel self conscious.  Service was prompt and attentive.' u'Very good. Fava bean appetizer with fresh pita. Shrimp with tomato and olive over rice was good - heavy on rice. Salad that came with shrimp dinner was simple and delicious. Seemed like romainefeta either dill or parsley or both and if there was a dressing it was very light. The Pinot Noir sold by the glass was very good.' u"Beautiful dinner at Dafni's we had lovely glass of wine with Greek Salad Chicken SouvlakiLamb Chops with side of lemon potatoes. Service as friendly and quick. We will definitely return if in the area." u"Enjoyed a recent pre-theater Sunday lunch here. Shared the three dips plate (we chose eggplant tzatziki and taromosalata -- although they brought is skordalia instead of the latter we didn't complain) the greek salad and the meat balls (meat patties) for a Sunday lunch. Good portions and great flavors all around. Also had a pretty tasty walnut cake for dessert. Will be happy to include this in the pre-theater restaurant rotation!" u"This is a cute family-owned Greek restaurant that has amazing service and food. My friend and I both ordered fish - I ordered a whole fish - and it was such a large portion that I didn't even finish 3/4 of it (and I'm usually the number 1 member of the clean plates club). Everything is fresh and authentic. I also had some Greek wine off their menu and it was great as well." u'My friend picked Dafni for my farewell dinner. The food were amazingly great. Every single dish delighted us with its freshness and tasteful savour. Staff was very friendly providing excellent service. Will go there again next time I visit NYC.' u'So the week oh 5/10/17 I was on a short vacation in New York for the first time. I found this restaurant and decide to eat here. I was pleased with the food and location but the waiter Petros was a different question. After I was done eating I asked for the check and my total was $58.15. I added 15% tip and figured it was good. Few minutes later the waiter returned back with the check and he had wrote a note on top. "Tip is not included 20% thank you"\n\nI thought this was very disrespectful and unprofessional. \n\nOverall food quality and price was amazing!!' u"The Quick: Flavorful juicy lamb and tzatziki paired with fresh out of the oven pita.. Opa! *upgrading to 5 stars this spot really is amazing \n\nThe Details: If I was served by a gorgeous blue-eyed Greek man I might be persuaded I was in Greece. Note my female waitress was lovely but it's not the same effect.\n\nThe lamb Gyro is fantastic as is the homemade sauces and pita. Get this with a side salad and you've hit a home run. The pork souvlaki was less impressive I would stick with lamb or chicken. I recommend the saganaki to start which is literally gooey fried cheese; diet friendly?\n\nThe Damage: Four entrees and one split appetizer came to $23 each with a generous tip. Highly recommend." u'We picked this restaurant because it was conveniently only a few blocks from the theater we went to this weekend and we were not disappointed! They serve delicious fresh pita bread to start and we ordered a trio of dips app (garlic eggplant and cheese spread with a little kick) with vegetarian dolmades. They were all so yummy. We also devoured an entree each not knowing portions would be huge and split a large baklava for dessert anyway! The vegetarian moussaka (eggplant and carrots with mashed potatoes on top) was superb. The spanakopita was also very flavorful. My sister enjoyed a seafood dish and I also got a poached pear salad (the dressing was a tad too sweet). Three entrees would have been plenty for the 4 of us!' u"Hubby and I have been here with a Groupon twice and each time we are blown away by the quality of the food! The lobster is exquisitely seasoned; the octopus is amazing; the Greek salad is to die for! It's quaint and cute and perfect for a date with your spouse!" u"So ordered Pastisio. Comes with a basic salad. Wanted to 'upgrade' to a Greek salad - yes a little feta comes with the green - the add on charge was nearly as much as the meal. Outrageous. \n\nFood was acceptable but certainly not outstanding. Busy theatre neighbourhood makes Dafni a pass by for me next time. Better Mediterranean offers in the hood" u"This is some of the best food I've ever had. The lamb gyro was so deliciously cooked. The wait staff are very hospitable. It's a nice restaurant. Definitely be back!" u'So glad my bf and I decided on this place (thanks Yelp) over our usual go to food: Asian cuisine. It was different (Greek) and we had no regrets after dinner! \n\nAlmost every table was occupied when we walked in but I love that we got seated right away! I also loved the ambience of the restaurant; the mood lighting was romantic. And the customer service was A1! \n\nMy bf and I kind of ordered the same meal but with just different meat/side dish. I got the lamb shish kebab and my bf got the chicken souvlaki. The dish came with your choice of rice or potatoes tzatziki and cucumber relish. The meat was tender and everything on my dish was delicious!! Very generous portions and I actually was not able to finish my dish as I ate a couple of the pita bread that they serve you right after ordering. \n\nIf you are looking for something new I would totally recommend this place!! Wish I can go back and try their other dishes!!' u'i had high hopes for dafni... whoops. \n\nreservation: easy peasy. would\'ve been fine without one on a sunday evening- the resto was only about 1/4 full. \n\nlocation: convenient for lunch before a show or dinner after. located on 42nd between 8th and 9th ave so if you\'re walking from (or back to) penn or the port authority from times square or the theater district it\'s on the way.\n\nmenu: looked promising. lots of options for meat lovers and vegetarians too. rather large range of choices from cold and hot apps to salads meats seafood and dessert too. the prices seemed a bit better than average for the area too. \n\nso far so good. seemed like a  winner for dinner after a show with mom. until...\n\nshowed up about 30 min prior to our reservation only to be told that they were cash-only for the day. umm a phone call would\'ve been nice - they had my number since i had a reservation. not everyone from out of the area carries cash at all times. to top it off i didn\'t even bring my debit card into the city with me so i couldn\'t use the ATM around the block. at peak dinner time it was not gonna be easy to get into somewhere else without a reservation. fortunately mom had some cash (leaving me feeling guilty since i had planned to treat her to dinner). there was no apology from the resto just a shrug of the shoulders. i should\'ve trusted my gut and left right then... \n\nwe sat down and ordered: a trio of spreads and stuffed grape leaves for an app then moussaka for mom and gyro meat with potatoes for me. the app came out seconds after our waitress walked away after taking our order. the spreads were decent- the eggplant one being my fave. the pita bread was warmed up but sadly not homemade. as soon as we began to dig in mom\'s side salad (comes with the moussaka) appeared at the table. i mean "salad" might be an overstatement - it was really just a plate of chopped lettuce with a sprinkling of feta on top. \n\nnot even half-way through our app our main courses came out. since there wasn\'t enough room on our 2-top for all of the plates they dragged over another table to put our main-course dishes on umm... hello? we\'re so not ready for mains. also no need to hover and fill our water glasses after every sip. sheesh. \n\nanyway... the food was overall mediocre. not bad but definitely not good enough to go back for or even recommend. the gyro entree was ice cold by the time i was able to dig in. the strips of meat were good with a side of potatoes and tzaziki. the tzaziki was probably the highlight of the plate tbh. mom\'s moussaka was cold but pretty tasty and the peas were ok too. nothing spectacular.\n\nfunny thing is it took foreverrrr to get the check at the end. finally hunted someone down plopped down cash and bolted. \n\nresto deserves 2 stars... the extra one is for location and reasonable pricing. \n\nbye dafni.' u'Good choice for delicious food nice atmosphere. From the charcoal grilled menu I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki ($16) and my boyfriend ordered the Pikilia ($20) combination platter. The skewers of meat and vegetables were delicious! The meats were well cooked and seasoned. The meals came with cucumber relish rice pilaf and tzatziki sauce. We left full (with leftovers to bring home!) and satisfied. Will definitely be returning here in the future!'],0.4574,0.299,0.701,0.0
98.Steak Freak,[u"The first thing you noticed when you get on this block is like 7 or 8 food carts but only two of them have really long lines (the other is the Lil Zeus Lunch Box cart) there is a reason for that good food and great service.\n\nOne of my favorite food trucks the steak is surprisingly tender and is tastier then some of the pricier steak house I've been too.  The wait is a little longer because they make everything to order but it's totally worth it.  During the regular lunch hours around 12 to 2 is probably the worst in terms of wait time so I like to go earlier if I can." u'Absolutely amazing tasty food! Service was friendly & pleasant! \n\nI arrived at closing but as I begged them to serve me whatever they had as I came from far I managed to get the Kimchee Sesame Steak w rice & salad for $9. \n\nThe guys that served me were super sweet & gracious. Am so grateful they did not turn me away despite having practically nothing left. \n\nThe steak was juicy tender & delicious. The sauce had a bit of spicy kick & just right. The rice was aromatic & very flavorful. \n\nWish I worked perm across this truck as I could easily eat their food daily! \n\nThis was a yelp gem find! Thank you yelp!' u"This is the best meal I've ever had from a food truck!\n\nBased on reviews I avoided the 45min wait and planned a late lunch. I put my order in at 2:15pm and got it 13 minutes later. There was a steady stream of customers both before and after me. \n\nI ordered the half Manchurian chicken and half steak basil over brown rice. It costs a little more at $10 vs the usual $9 for steak alone or $8 for chicken but it's so worth it. I liked being able to go back and forth between the two dishes because just one of the tastes would have been too much for me. I love the way they do their chicken - fried on the outside without heavy batter in a sweet sauce. The steak is also delicious and the meat is not too chewy. They give a LOT of meat too. I ran out of rice early and still had a good 6 chunks of meat left. As for the salad that comes with the meal I'm not sure if they dress it or it soaked in flavor from the meat but the it was tasty!\n\nThe guy manning the window was very polite and friendly. He must have a high stress job so props to him for being so happy all day!" u"There are so many food trucks in the area but I find myself coming back to this one at least once a week. So good. And so much protein. The sesame beef is awesome the sauce is great without being overwhelming. And everything is made when you order so expect to wait a few minutes for your order.\n\nThe guy somehow remembers everyone's orders without writing anything down; sometimes I like to walk around and take off my jacket to try and throw him off.\n\nDon't be fooled by the (relatively) short line this is probably the best food truck on 50th & 6." u'I got here at exactly 11:00am so there was no wait yet.  Ordered the Steak Frites.  They make the fries first and add a small salad on the side then put the steak on on top.  Total cost $10.  The fries get a bit soggy since they close the lid but flavor wise on both the fries and steak is good.  The steak is surprisingly tender for a food cart.  Would definitely recommend if you want a cheap steak fix.' u"The Quantity and the flavor didin't disappoint  Will definitely go back even though its a .5 mile walk from work :)" u"OH MY GOD this is by far my favorite food cart!! Yes the line is like 45 minutes but it is what it is. Delicious things require patience. I ordered the honey chicken and although it looked nothing like the picture on the food cart it was still delicious and yummy and amazing and ya. I did notice that everyone seemed to be ordering the noodles so I definitely FOMOd out there but guess what I'm getting this Friday...yuppp the noodles. If you could kindly all go when  I'm not there so I don't have to wait forever that would be great! :)" u'Reading on yelp that it would be packed at 12 i got there at 11:20ish. There were a few people but not too bad. I ordered a steak frite the steak was soooo juicy and tender. The fries had an interested seasoning it tasted like salt pepper garlic powder and maybe a touch of grated cheese. The salad was decent. But the star was definitely the steak. The guy owning the food truck was very nice and you could see he genuinely took pride in being there. I got all of that for $10. I will definitely be coming there again.' u'WOW\n\nLocation: Steak Freak is lining up with all other food trucks. You will definitely see the line when you got there\n\nI had their signature dish - steak fritas. It is good steak is seasoned so well and so fresh. The best part is their fries. Crispy and every bite is mixed balanced with canju sauce\n\nThe food is so good that you might lose your lunch time and just wanna simply enjoy it.\n\nPrice: less than 10 dollars.\n\nOverall: best steak fritas in town!' u"STEAK IN A CART?? I was really wary about trying this place out but I'm glad I grew a pair. \n\nSteak Frites - The beef is OK (it's a cart not Peter Lugers dammit) and the fries are good. I always ask for extra white garlic sauce. Obsessed with that. \n\nSteak Basil - My favorite! Always get it with the brown rice my personal preference. \n\nThe wait is a little long but the food is good." u"I just can't give this place four stars even though the line can be soul crushing. The food is too good and these guys making it are too nice. Highly highly recommend - just not between 12:00 and 2:00. Pictures" u'An excellent lunch option...so long as you get there before 11:30 or after the lunch rush. The wait can be a bit overwhelming at times but is well worth it. \n\n"Steak" may be the operative word in the cart\'s name but the Chicken Manchurian is by far my favorite dish. It\'s got a lot of flavor juicy and generally very tasty. I usually opt for a combination with the Chicken Manchurian and Beef Basil. For $10 the beef chicken brown rice and salad are a bargain. You get enough food to fill you up but not so much that you are inevitably lulled into a mid-afternoon nap at your desk.' u"I REAAAALLLLY want to like this place because the food is absolutely delicious and it is the best affordable food that I've had in Midtown but.. I waited almost an hour and thirty minutes for my meal so.. I would love to try this place again but the line has definitely scarred me.\n\nThis place was kind of difficult to find since the Yelp address is misleading. It's in front of a chase bank located on 50th street between 6th and 7th avenue. There's a whole row of food trucks here and the line for Steak Freak is always the longest so.. it's difficult to miss. As I mentioned early I was on this line for practically an hour and a half since they only take 3 orders at a time and when people begin ordering more than one plate for themselves the wait is extended even more. Their system of ordering really needs to be improved the guy in the front memorizes them.. when it would be much more efficient to write it down or as others have said give out a number. It takes a little bit for the food to be prepared probably 10 minutes after you've ordered. I guess it's my fault because I got here around 1:15pm just in time for the lunch rush.\n\nThe food itself is delicious and goes well with the spicy mayo and white sauce that they give you. The meat is a little rough and overcooked but not a dealbreaker. The salad is crunchy and tastes good mixed in with your meal.. nothing bad I could really say about the food.. But please!! I can't spend my entire lunch break waiting on line!!\n\nOh.. You also pay AFTER you receive your food so.. if you don't have cash you definitely have time to go to the bank to get it." u"I find it hard to give 5 stars for a food truck-- it has to be reallyyyy amazing so consider this a 4.5 (because I didn't get to try their steak frites since they alwayssss run out of fries early).\n\nI came here for lunch and ordered the sesame steak. The sauce was flavorful and the steak was just right (just the right amount of chewy and tender). You can choose between white or brown rice and it comes with some salad.\n\nThe guy handling the truck itself was SUPER NICE. Always smiles and always polite-- excellent service.\n\nI will definitely be stopping by again. Awesome food decent prices and excellent service." u'Excellent food cart. The Honey Chicken Glaze is like food crack. They give healthy portion sizes and every menu item is good. Only down side is that the service is a bit slow so be prepared to wait.' u"I don't normally eat at food trucks but this one is great. They are friendly and fast and the food is hot and fresh. I highly recommend!" u"I think I've once again fallen victim to the hype.\n\nIt's possible I just got a real doozie of a poor quality batch of meat but I doubt it because I've been there 3 times. I have had the Chicken Manchurian the Steak Basil and the Teriyaki Noodles. The steak and chicken were both chewy and grizzly each time I ordered them. The noodles were lackluster. I was disappointed. I won't bother waiting on the lines to give their meat another whirl I just feel it'll be wasted time and money.\n\nThe only other time I tried to go I really wanted cajun fries and saw that they offer them. They told me no problemo if I didn't mind waiting 20min. Wasn't worth it for me to stick around just for fries. Also 20min? ..... Anyways I guess either some people are cool with this quality meat or I've had the worst possible luck." u'Steak frites and basil steak are absolutely delicious for lunch! They really pack quite a lot in there too so make sure you have room for it.' u"The line takes much longer than it looks like it will take!! Keep that in mind if you're on a lunch break or go before noon when it's not as crowded.\n\nI only got to visit this truck once because I just don't have enough time to wait in line and I don't yet have an intern that I can send to get it. But it is still my favorite food truck around. Get the steak basil it's awesome. A great blend of steak and Asian fusion sauces. The two guys working here really work hard and make amazing food go check it out!" u"Affordable and tasty food in Midtown.  Who doesn't like food truck?  Whenever I'm visiting my friend's office he always takes me here.  Steak chimichurri is our fave.  Generous portion for the price you pay.  I also tried chicken basil but .. it's not the kind of basil I used to have.  It tasted more like ... general sao to me.  Nonetheless it's good.  \n\nThe line can be long during lunch hours but it moves pretty quickly."],0.6486,0.264,0.736,0.0
24.Taste Kitchen,[u"This is a great place. The soup buns are excellent. Wow! Definitely get those as an appetizer. The beef and broccoli is pretty salty but the broccoli is huge and fresh. Few places have fresh broccoli. The beef was plentiful and cut thick. It was a delicious dish aside from being salty. The service is excellent. The place is not fancy but exactly what you'd expect at the price point. Very clean smells nice. They deliver too. We will be back!" u"My friend and I are always shopping for good Chinese delivery. \n\nTaste kitchen is a two thumbs up.\n\nFirst of all the lady taking my order was super nice and double checked my order and cc # before hanging up. Maybe it's just me but I've had pretty crazy convos where I would call order and all they asked was for the address (while they speak 100 words per sec). I had to call back to give them my cc #. So compared to that this place was awesome.\n\nDelivery didn't take long (sorry I didn't time them or anything or ask them for the estimated time). \n\nWe ordered the egg drop soup egg rolls house special chow fun pan fried noodles and pancakes. \n\nMaybe they added this because they just newly opened but we also got a $5 discount card for our next order orange slices and a container of kimchi! All for free. \n\nI personally had the egg roll and chow fun. I enjoyed both! Egg roll is veggie so all you vegetarians you're good! Chow fun could have had a little more flavor but it wasn't greasy as ones I've tried prior. So that's always a plus. Oh I had the pancakes too. Nothing special (clearly since I forgot I ate them). My friend said the egg drop was too eggy. But if you like eggs thumbs up! \n\nWe'll def order from this place again!!! \n\nOne downside I think it closes at 10pm. A little earlier than others but as long as you're not having late night drunk cravings you're set." u'Soup buns are great!   The hot and sour soup has a lot of black pepper flavor but the quantity of stuff in it (mushrooms tofu etc.) makes up for that.  The service is friendly and very accommodating.  The brisket soup with udon noodle was sooooooo good.  Has lots of meat tasty bok choy an the depth of flavor in the broth is spot on!   My wife had the beef and broccoli.  She liked the flavor and the fact that the beef was not overly silkened. We will definitely come back and try something else.' u'Great service and friendly staff. This was the BEST sweet and sour chicken my family and I ever had.' u'Awesome spot if your in the city. Very friendly and great customer service. The food is very flavorful. For 2 people we got the broccoli in brown sauce boneless spare ribs and order of white rice. Great amount to share. Plus freshly made chicken wings as appetizers. Definitely recommend it.' u"By far the best Chinese spot in the neighborhood. Pricewise it's not bad for midtown. The place is clean friendly and it's between 8th and 9th so far less tourists and annoying people." u'Quiet place with mainly Cantonese and Shanghainese dishes. On a lazy Sunday the chef prepared a phenomenal Cantonese roast chicken -- authentically rustic with coarse cut ginger garlic and scallion in a stone pot; very nice with sticky rice!' u'This a special place on the left side of Abaya Thai restaurant. I found this restaurant to be clean and fresh.The food amazing. I expected the regular Chinese food taste like from around the block but its fresh and tasty. It is mostly a lunch crowd.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
114.Paul’s On Times Square,[u"Never been here nor have I ever seen this place before and why is that?\nWell it's in a hotel - fancy huh?\n\nBut anyways - came here for dinner with the boyfriend since he got a groupon. \nThe deal includes two apps / starters and pasta. \n\nI looked through some pictures the night before to see how good the food looks and of course skim through the reviews. I had two pastas in mind ; the penne with salmon and the squid / black linguine with shrimp. \nIt so happens my boyfriend wanted the black pasta so I went with my second choice; I mean I have a bf for something. To steal his food  ...DUH!\nWe also got the duck pizza and the smoked sausages. \n\nI'll talk about the food first since that's one of the top important things...hahaha. \nWe were given some bread with olive (?) oil and it was pretty simple but a good start. Our apps came out - both at the same time. \nThe sausage was pretty smoky which was good but to me it was a bit salty. It could be that I'm not into the sausage scene but my boyfriend liked it a lot. I mean if I had rice or something with it maybe it won't be salty? But it could be my own preference of course. \nSo we got the duck pizza that came with plenty of sweet onions - I really dig the pizza. It wasn't super bread-y or too much crust. It was just right and the overall flavors weren't too overbearing or powerful.  The duck wasn't gamey and didn't have any sort of smell. It was pretty tender and there was no pull needed. You can just simply take a bite and enjoy! I love caramelized onions and the pizza we got had just the right amount. It wasn't too much or too little - just right. \nAH! the pizza wasn't tomato based btw - it was light cheese duck onions and olive. And it didn't feel too heavy since I was able to get to my pasta once it has arrived. \n\nNext was the pastas! although when it came out i didn't think it was small I didn't think it was big either - portion wise. But I think at the end I figured it was about the right size since we had our apps.  So for my pasta; the penne salmon - there were a few big chucks of salmon. They were pretty good in that they weren't overcooked and dry. The pasta was al dente and you can taste that it was fresh and not from the box. Although I liked penne el vodka I kind of thought it got heavy for me since it is made with heavy cream. Or usually it does. Luckily  the BF was there and I asked if we could trade. (I asked and was given consent!!) I liked the black pasta more since it's tomato based. (I personally like pesto or tomato based pastas) So that pasta comes with shrimp and they were decently sized. They tasted fresh as well  - not the frozen kind. I should know....I don't like shrimp much either lol. But they tasted clean and sweet not from the pasta sauce but from itself. \n\nSo overall the food was great!!\n\nShort note on the service : They were AMAZING!! The staff were friendly helpful and attentive. They were attentive that they weren't overbearing like some places and they gave you space. They just always re-filled out water and asked if the food was good. \n\nI would come here again - without the groupon too! Deff give it a try if you want some quality food." u'So we came here on a Friday night after work and it was cool had reservations and no wait time.\nAppetizers : We had fried calamari which was so good. We also tried the bruschetta with goat cheese. Yummm! \nEntree: I had the smoked salmon penne which was good though I\'ve had better at neighborhood corner pizza shops. Serving size was not that big either and the pasta was warm not so much "hot and fresh" though. \nMy husband had the filet mignon with potatoes. The potato serving was small but the steak was great. Flavor was delish and cooked well. \nDessert: cheesecake now I can\'t discriminate because I love all cakes and all cheeses. So I loved it! \nDrinks: Sangria was good. Mojito tasted like soda to me.\nAmbience: Touristy casual but because of the location you may see some suits and ties. \nOverall it was a nice place service was great. Just a bit pricey and didn\'t live up to the prices for me.' u"Purchased the Groupon deal as most did on here based on the rave reviews. I definitely agree with the majority of the reviewer's opinions. Nothing to fear here the food is excellent however the service could have been a bit more swift. Things started off a bit rocky because I made a reservation as the Groupon stated however when my bf and I got to the restaurant the hostess indicated she did not see it in the system.\n\nLuckily the restaurant was very empty so we got in with no problem. With the groupon you get 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. For apps we chose the margherita pizza which was outstanding and a delicious caesar salad! When I tell you the pizza and salad were fabulous I am not kidding! Some of the freshest and most flavorful pairings I've ever had. For my entree I chose the penne ala vodka with veggies instead of salmon and my boyfriend chose the spaghetti with veal. Both dishes were awesome and beautifully presented! On the downside they served us some bread in the beginning that was stale and the oil was just pure sad but the rest of the meal made up for it certainly!!\n\nThe style of the restaurant blew me away! The decor is so beautiful classy and inviting and overall just very New York!!! My reason for not giving 5 stars is due to it taking so long for us to be served in the beginning. Our order was not taken for quite some time with only about 4 other patrons in the restaurant. Our waiter though was very attentive and kind!" u"My boyfriend and I came here after watching a Broadway show. We used a Groupon which was TOTALLY WORTH IT!!\n\nI'm not sure if it's because we got there at 10:45 p.m. and the kitchen closed at 11 p.m. or what but the service was pretty fast. If they did rush I must say they still did a great job because all the flavors were there and everything tasted great! \n\nI was happy that we went as late as we did because it was pretty empty and we were able to really enjoy the atmosphere. It was almost as though we had the place to ourselves. Our server was really nice her name was Ardijana. We loved her! She always had a smile on her face and was attentive to us (again probably because it wasn't too busy - nevertheless she was still great!).\n\nThe Groupon was for 2: 2 Appetizers Salads or Pizzas and 2 Pasta Entrees. We decided to mix and match:\n\nAppetizer:\nFried calamari\nDino's Duck Confit w. Caramelized Onions\n\nPasta Entree:\nCapellini Al Frutti Di Mare\nPenne Vodka Al Salmone\n\nAs I mentioned before everything tasted great! I bet it would have tasted even better had taken advantage of the beautiful outdoor seating however the choice was ours as it was just way to hot outside.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and modern with a beautiful bar filled with variety. They even have a television for view sports. Two things I would like to note are the bathrooms the prices and the location of the restaurant. The bathrooms are gender neutral and single rooms. There are two and could use a little more work and care in cleanliness department. The prices are pretty steep so if you do not plan on purchasing a Groupon and would like to come here plan on spending quite a bit. As for the location of the restaurant it's not in plain sight as it is located on the second floor of the restaurant. If you are a tourist you can easily miss it if you are not paying attention to the outside of the hotel doors where a menu/sign is tapered to the wall.\n\nAll in all I would definitely return with a Groupon and possibly without one although only for a very very special occasion. Also you do have the option of ordering entrees outside of the Groupon but just be aware you will be billed and taxed separately from it. If you're near by and would like a semi-fancy new place to try definitely pass through (with a Groupon if you'd like to save some dough) otherwise\n\n\n- Don't go hungry in the city who's nickname has Apple in the title!" u"Paul I'm impressed!  I debated buying the Groupon due to it seeming to be too good of a deal.  From the service to the food you aced it!  \n\nWe scored a table outside.  From our seat we could see the Times Square ball.  It was a pretty sweet place to sit.  During happy hour you can sit at any table and still score the happy hour prices.\n\nI began with the prosciutto pizza.  This was probably one of the best specialty pizzas I've ever tried.  The crust was just the right amount of thickness making it crispy and allowing the other flavors to shine.  The fig jam.  YUM!  Who knew fig jam could make a pizza.  Then the prosciutto so tender with just the right amount of saltiness.  I can be very picky because some prosciuttos are fatty and stringy but not this one.  The pizza was so good my hunny even liked it and he's not a prosciutto fan.  Way to go this means I'll be going back!  My hunny had margarita pizza.  Once again a quality cheese with a tasty sauce.  We agreed we'd return for the pizza alone!\n\nI had the frutti di mare. It was very good too.  It had a decent amount of fish.  Everything was fresh and tender.  \n\nI feel Paul's works hard to ensure the customer is happy and leaves satisfied.  Our waitress went above and beyond to accommodate us.  She even offered us more water after we paid the bill on a Saturday around 6.  I will absolutely be returning!" u'Food was very good. Staff very attentive.\nHad a great experience. If you want to see the street mention that you want to sit at the windows Street side.' u"Groupon deal is awesome!! You get so much food! We always get one pizza and a salad in addition to two pasta entrees. It's tucked inside the Hilton Garden Hotel on 42nd Street." u"First time eating at Paul's for restaurant week. I would have to say that the quality of food was great but it tasted mediocre. My boyfriend asked about the beers on draft and the waitress said the pump at the bar is broken so there's no beer but any other drinks are available. I'm thinking if you own a bar and have happy hour prices you should probably fix the pump as soon as possible because a lot of people are going to ask for beer! But anyway...The appetizers we ordered were mussels and fried calamari. These were okay. Didn't taste like anything special. For our entrees we had the salmon penne vodka. The salmon was cooked perfectly! However the penne could have been softer and the sauce became a little overwhelming. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the chocolate mousse. The chocolate mousse was a little too sweet for my palette. My boyfriend said the tiramisu was pretty good though. \n\nWait staff were kind of slow. Although we got our food pretty quickly it took a while to flag down the waitress for our check.\n\nNot sure if we'll come back as it wasn't anything too special but thank you for restaurant week deals!" u'This place is hidden in a hotel. Loved the food here everything was so delicious. But the service could be improved.' u'My fiance and I went on Saturday night. Used the Living Social coupon which was definitley worth it. All the food was very good except for the calamari. It was undercooked and we did not eat it. The Quattro Formaggio Pizza with Truffle Oil was tasty. Ordered the Ravioli and Penne Vodka for entrees which were small portions and did not leave you feeling overstuffed. Both were excellent.' u'Food was delicious. Ambiance was romantic and well decorated. Thought  I would get  a better view of the city but that wad not the case. Staff is friendly and food did not take long to come.' u'Used Groupon for 4. Everything about the place is excellent. The wait staff was attentive and accommodating. The food was delicious. We had seafood and everything was fresh and well-seasoned. We were seated outside in the small balcony. Great view of the famousNew Years Eve ball. Drinks were a bit pricy but this is NYC afterall. Would definitely recommend.' u'Nice setting little confusing as they hand you a menu and a tablet so I thought I was supposed order with the tablet but they came and took my order so I have no idea why they give you a tablet and a menu. Had a martini which was OK olives were terrible. Had shrimp cocktail and cocktail sauce was very good but the shrimp is very tough. Margarita pizza was excellent nice flavor cooked well and very tasty. A descent place to eat.' u'Came on a Groupon deal I found on while surfing Groupon. It was $40 for a 2 appetizers and 2 entrees which I thought was a wonderful deal given the restaurant\'s price point and the location. My friend was visiting from California so we got a quick meal before her flight back to LA. The food was impeccable - the tomato mozzarella appetizer salad was delicious the prosciutto fig pizza "appetizer" was HUGE - honestly we could\'ve just stopped there and been fine. We ordered a seafood red sauce pasta of sorts as well as an Italian sausage marinara sauce pasta and both were delicious as well. When it came to the end of the meal though they brought out a bill to sign for $30 - I didn\'t really understand where it came from but signed it anywas and we left. I guess they charged us tax and tip for the original price of the meal?? I didn\'t catch this caveat in the Groupon I bought (don\'t know if it was even on there) but it kind of caught me off guard. Overall good meal but was not expecting to pay $70 since I\'d already paid $40 beforehand and thought that was it. Location is lovely though - a classy restaurant and addition to the Hilton in Times Square.' u'Great spot  drinks are priced right for being in a hotel and so was the food. \n\nWe enjoyed the music and chill spot service was good and I loved that they have a menu on a tablet with pictures ! You know exactly what your getting  they should however have the waiter explain the menu a bit with the pictures  would make the experience a bit better ! Overall great though' u"Buyer beware.   Two double Stolis and a cocktail landed us with a bill of $83. We were a bit surprised since the same drink order at a bar on 43rd street was only $40.  Our bar waitress was rude and I'm pretty sure I saw her pour a glass of red wine that started with 1/2 glass of water!" u'The restaurant is located in the Hilton garden inn. Very stylish restaurant. I purchased a groupon online. Not a big menu. Appetizers salads personal size pizza and pasta dishes. The appetizers and salads were overpriced. The pasta dishes were priced just right. Did not look at the pizza prices. Pappardelle with mushrooms and a truffle cream sauce . Outstanding! Black linguine with shrimps in a spicy tomato sauce. Outstanding! Mozzarella and tomato salad so so. Crispy squid so so. Great service! Average appetizers plus great pasta dishes plus great service equal I will be back. But I would eat at the bar eating pasta and drinking a glass wine.' u"We went here based on location from where we were and Yelp reviews.  It did feel weird eating at a hotel restaurant that as not on ground level.    I got the pasta with eggplant which was good and they serve it right out of the eggplant.  We had an amazing bottle of wine which we have tried to hunt down the last few days.  The service was good but it definitely wasn't busy as we didn't even get there till after 9:30pm.    The bar which was small was full but probably with hotel guests.   Would I go again yes.....for that dam wine (Amanda Valpolicella Ripasso) which we can't find!!" u"Staying at the hotel grabbed A quick lunch- Paul's salad was amazing! Only thing is you have to add chicken or shrimp to any salad which makes it a bit pricey but not was it good.\n\nAt night grabbed the goat cheese bruschetta with a drink and I would get that again for sure. Very small pieces but plenty of topping! A lot of choices with their apps so was hard to choose!" u'I love this small dimly lit  restaurant. We began with the "Breakfast " pizza of bacon eggs and  I liked it. It is filling but I ordered it as an appetizer for me and my two children one of whom is an adult. We also ordered the fried calamari. That was fried nicely and delicious.  I had the Salmon with Vodka sauce WOW  that was as good as it gets. We also ordered the Fettuciine Alfredo. Fantastic flavor. One problem though; the pasta portions are just too small. They give you these gigantic plates and you would expect at least a half pound of pasta in it but its about six or seven forkfuls. Not enough for a hungry man like my son. He had six or seven fork fulls and the dinner plate was empty so I told the waiter who brought  him another serving (free) and that too was as cheap as the first. What ? in a great place like this skimping on cheap spaghetti or noodles is not the right time or place to do that.  Increase the volume of pasta to the people. Its better to have them take it home in a take out bag than to feel cheated with the amount of noodles. That is why I gave it four instead of five stars. Everything else was great.  Shout out to the Excellent waiter and staff working the floor. They are second to none and fabulous.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
167.Five Senses,[u'A friend recommended this place to me and i sort of went with no expectations. As i was looking through the menu most of the things were very typical korean food that i usually see back at home. I saw couple things that i never tried before and something that i usually dont see at a korean restaurant i decided to try it. I ordered this oyster soup and it was delicious...it was beyond my expectations and the flavor to seasonings it was perfect for my taste. It had good amount of oysters and other vegetables(tofuenokiradish etc). \n\nAlthough the soup is as good the cheese seafood spicy rice cakes we ordered as an appetizer was just too sweet for me... it was good portion and they put generous amount of seafood! But just too sweet!' u"After a night of going out my friends and I were in the mood for korean food (specifically soup).  The funny thing was that we were recommended the adjacent restaurant and mistook this place for it.  We saw a line out the door and assumed this was the place.  The restaurant is small  but definitely bustling.  The wait for a party of 8 was 30 mins or so.  They will ask your party to come in and stand in the back of the restaurant (near the bathrooms) until your table is ready.  We were split into 2 groups (no big deal).\nAmbiance:  A typical mom and pop korean restaurant.  Tables are close together.  Not good for big parties unless you don't mind sitting separately.  \nService:  Fair considering it is a korean restaurant.  We had to flag someone down to place our order.  They spoke and understood english.  I flagged someone down for water.  Food came out at a decent pace but not all at once.\nFood:  They had a wide variety of korean dishes.  We opted to try the kimchi fried rice.  Cool thing is that they mix it table side on a hot plate.  They also add cheese.  I thought the rice was really good.  Loved the burnt crispy rice at the bottom.  Great flavor.  I got the galbi tang (beef rib soup).  IT was really good.  Nice flavor and the meat was soft and tender.  You have to ask for the sauce (soy sauce with mustard).  That took it to another level.  They give you a fair amount of banchan to go with it.  The soup really hit the spot.\n\nI would come again." u'When you crave something new something bold something to chew id recommend the savory umami laden Gabli (short ribs in sauce) with Kim chi fried rice. The mothers black cod and seafood hot pot came with approximately half a lb of black cod 1 scallop 1 prawn 3 little neck clams and two large slices of tofu. We were served ample portions of each dish. \n\nService was attentive and they made every effort to keep our glasses full napkins aplenty and table clean. I will definitely be back to Five Senses in the near future. Next time I will order the triple fried chicken wings and another mozz covered Kim chi fried rice.' u"We gave it another go. We arrived on a Friday at around 6pm and the line was already brewing up a hungry crowd. \n\nThe food was much better the second time around - sad considering we had ordered their signature dishes on our first go and were very disappointed. We went with more traditional dishes this time and it was a success. The bathroom is absolutely disgusting but otherwise I'm upping this to 4 stars. It's a busy spot so service isn't par but I have no problem yelling for attention. \n\nThe galbitang had good depth in its broth and the seafood cheesy dukbokki had a good kick. The banchan was better this time as well." u"On the street that is K-town in NYC this is my favorite restaurant. No matter what I'm in the mood for Five Senses delivers. Overall I do think it's pricer than other spots around but the quality and service and atmosphere makes it all worth it. \n\nFirst I think Five Senses has the best mul naemyeong in K-town. Ice cold broth with chewy noodles  and beef and topped with melon and pear. Always ask for the vinegar and mustard. It's so good and refreshing. I think it's the melon and pear that makes it stand out above the rest!\n\nThe fried chicken here is also really good--juicy chicken extra crispy skin. The only thing that's lacking is spice. I typically like the option to get the wings hot but they're mildly spicy at best. Still really good though!\n\nI'm not a massive fan of dukbokki but my husband is and only when he orders it at Five Senses do I share with him. The rice cakes aren't overly doughy it has good heat served with lots of seafood (squid clams scallops prawns and shrimp) and topped with gooey cheese! It's so good and is great as leftovers too ;)\n\nThen the kbbq. It's not the type of joint where you grill your own meat. In some ways it's a perk for those times you don't want to walk out and have everything you're wearing smelling like you has kbbq. The galbi is my favorite of the meats--so tender and well marinated. Delicious! But definitely pricier than I would like. \n\nAnyway there are many more delicious options and the restaurant is always pretty busy. Going off-prime meal times will ease the waiting time. Usually though the line moves quickly. \n\nJust go!" u'A rare spot that does love up to the hype! Even though it was a busy night I never felt rushed by the staff. The food came promptly and the portions were generous. Due to my friend not liking spice we asked for everything to be mild. They accommodated and even put the fried chicken sauce on the side. The ginseng chicken soup was perfect for a chilly night. It was a pleasant surprise to have brussel sprouts in the japchae.' u"Raining hard one day but this place was still packed during lunch.\n\nThe man who looked like the owner takes my wet umbrella and places it in the umbrella bags so water won't drip everywhere before my party was seated.\n\nWas hoping to choose the lunch special but Columbus day was a holiday so the specials wasn't available.  Had to choose from the regular menu which was like 4-5$ more for the same dishes.\n\nGot the army stew and beef fried rice.  Both tastes really good and not overly salty.  The army stew was lacking in noodles.  If I were to go back I would skip on the army stew unless you are really craving for a soupy meal.\n\nService was really good and the side dishes were your normal kimchi string beans tofu cakes radishes and some japchae noodles." u'What a winner. Stumbled in at 9:30pm on a Monday night was seated within a couple minutes and was brought ban chan as soon as we ordered. I couldn\'t get enough of their ban chan; it includes some tried and true items and some new ones. They do kimchi so well. I typically dislike it but I think Five Senses marks my turning point to where I\'m saying "I love kimchi!" \n\nWe ordered the Hae Mool Dae Gae Jaongol Casserole which includes snow crab blue crab scallops octopus squid conch clams monkfish shrimp and udon noodles in a mildly spicy broth. If you like seafood like me this one\'s obviously for you. It was fantastic. It felt like we were exploring the ocean with our mouths. Everything was so tasty and fresh. They cooked it for us on our table and after five minutes it was ready to go. The dish is enough for four people so I think it\'s worth the price. The two of us had half of it and got the rest to go.\n\nWe also got their barley tea. I thought it was so good! Went straight to H Mart and bought me some. \n\nThe table next to us got their scallion pancakes which I\'m so returning for. It was huge and looked so intricate! \n\nOn top of the gorgeous meal the place itself is classy clean and great for conversation. No need to yell but it\'s not too quiet where you hear your neighbor. If you want to impress your date this is the place.' u'My girlfriends and I stumbled upon this place on a late night looking for food. Price was a little higher than what we expected but you definitely get what you pay for. We had the soon du bu ji gae with seafood which had A LOT of seafood! We also tried the stir fry pork and squid which was super tasty!:) \n\nAlso they have a late night special for soju only $8.88!\n\nThis place is definitely worth going to if you are looking for a late night snack!:)' u"Not sure if it was the dish I ordered but I wasn't blown away by Five Senses. I ordered the cha dol bae ki and the dish was just okay to me. \n\nI do however love the banchan. Most Korean restaurants I go to usually have the same thing like fish cake kimchi spicy radish etc. but Five Senses' served banchan I've never seen before. The green bean dish was probably far by my favorite out of the bunch." u"Came here with my aunt around midnight after finishing a comedy show in Times Square. Both of us have never been here before and had heard good things. There were a few tables occupied. I think they had a HH going on at midnight so if that speaks to you....\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Kimchi fried rice (with beef) ($17.99)\n2. Tofu stew with vegetables ($13.99)\n\nI believe that we got a total of 5 banchan. My favorite was the green beans. They were chilled and crispy.\n\nThe fried rice was the first dish that came out. It was served on a hot plate with the rice piled high in the middle. The server then poured egg onto the plate and mixed together the egg and fried rice. I really like how there were crispy rice bits to eat. The flavors also really came together.\n\nBecause we wanted something that had a lot of vegetables in it and the server recommended that we get the tofu stew with vegetables. The tofu was not the soft kind that I had expected. It was closer to firm tofu. When they said vegetables they meant vegetables. There were all kinds of vegetables in there almost too much. This was definitely on the mild side in terms of flavor. I would not recommend this dish unless you are a vegetarian. \n\nThe service was super attentive and our food came out rather quickly. I don't think I would order the tofu stew again but the fried rice was good. It is no wonder that many people recommend it.  I would come back if I crave some good Korean food." u"A chill korean restaurant in ktown that is exactly what you'd expect- small packed and busy! I came last Friday to check it out after hearing so much about it but the food wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped... really long lines but efficient staffers got food out and moved people quickly. \n\nFood: 3/5\nSide dishes (banchan) to start- average tasting kimchi broccoli and fish cakes. Their potato macaroni salad was a bit dry but I liked that they gave you spicy rice cakes.\n\nBeef Tartare (yukhwe)- was in the mood for a little something light and delicious. This dish had ok flavor but disappointingly too many pieces of the meat were frozen yes frozen. Not worth trying.\n\nSpicy seafood rice cake w/cheese- the side dish put us in the mood for more of these tender cakes with spicy sauce and gooey cheese! Quite delicious with the bits of cabbage in it too (though it could've been spicier).\n\nKimchi fried rice with beef- heard raving reviews so had to try it! The aesthetic was cool where they cook it at your table but unfortunately the rice and beef turn really dry...\n\nService: 3/5\nNothing really notable here but can't complain- the standard polite push for a quick meal in & out.\n\nAmbience: 3/5\nFairly standard korean restaurant but cramped as expected in the small streets of ktown. It's a decent place to have a few quick bites." u"Had lunch with an old coworkers and she recommended to have lunch here and I absolutely love this place. It's a bit on the pricer side but well worth it. We ordered the clam soup and the kimchi fried rice. Both were huge portions and flavorful. They provide a lot of side dishes and were attentive to us even during busy lunch hours. I would come here again!" u"Came here midnight they weren't that busy. I ordered the kimchi soondubu Busan  style street jap chae peach and pomegranate soju.\n\nWe got our banchan with the rice for the soondubu but the soondubu wasn't ready yet. Don't let the kimchi color fool you it wasn't that spicy to me and it was missing that garlic and sour fermented taste.\n\nKimchi soondubu was very tasty. Good amount of spicy it wasn't too watery and I think the size of the pot is bigger than BCD Tofu House. \n\nBusan street jap chae had a lot of seafoods; decent size and peeled shrimps clams squid and scallops. As it cooled off it was a tiny bit too sweet for me. But overall a good price for the dish. \n\nThe peach and pomegranate soju's tasted very similar. Even though peach was 12% and pomegranate was 13.5% I think it was easier to drink the pomegranate one. At first the pomegranate flavor tasted like a mild cough syrup. Still good for $8.88!\n\nService was quick and staffs were efficient.i would definitely come back!" u"So bomb! Left with a full and happy tummy haha. We just came from the Empire State building and everything around us was Korean and I didn't realize till later that we were actually in Korea town. We came for lunch at around 11.40am and we were seated immediately. Right after we ordered a bunch of people started coming in and there was already a wait. We ordered seafood pancake chicken wings and galbi. \n\nA couple of minutes before our food came they gave us some kimchi. The kimchi's were different from the Korean places we tried back home but it was good different. Shortly after we got our seafood pancake and it tasted so delicious! I absolutely loved it. It was crunchy and wasn't salty at all. It also came with a dipping sauce. My bf thought his chicken wings were pretty good and I absolutely loved the Galbi! The chef cooked it perfectly! It wasn't burned at all. No complaints about the food! Totally loved every bite of it yum! \n\nAs for service most of the servers were pretty attentive. Before it got busy our water would be refilled quickly and when we asked for more napkins it was given to us fast. It did take them a long time to get our check though but that's okay we were in no rush." u"I love this place especially for their kimchi! I've never really been a fan of kimchi because it's usually soggy or plain from other establishments but Five Senses changed my outlook. Their kimchi was light crisp and better quality. You can tell immediately just by looking at the dark red color.\n\nMy friend and I came by late Saturday night at around 11:30pm and were seated right away. Surprisingly there was no line. Once we were seated and received our banchan the line had already started to build out the door so definitely come before midnight to avoid a long wait.\n\nWe ordered the kimchi pancake and the Yangnyeom Galbi. The waiter originally said that the portion was only enough for one but it was actually just the right amount for us to share considering the banchan and app. We didn't even touch the rice that came with the order.\n\nI usually order the seafood pancake but since my friend preferred kimchi we got that instead and was I glad that we did! Again Five Senses came through. The pancake wasn't oily dry plain or crunchy; it was fried just right with a soft center loaded with kimchi all throughout the pancake. I'm starting to see a pattern for all their kimchi based items.\n\nThe galbi was tender flavorful and cooked just right. It wasn't too sweet or too salty. The meat was easy to chew and cut up nicely. The only downside was that the raw onions weren't cooked even though they were on the sizzling platter." u"With plenty of Korean restaurants in the area how will you know which one to choose? Well five senses is one of my personal favorites and let me tell you why! They're open late and have great food. If you come here you have to try the kimchi pancake and the seafood spicy rice cakes. The kimchi pancake is made to crisp perfection and one of the best Korean pancakes I've had. The seafood spicy rice cakes is delicious - the rice cakes are chewy they are generous with the seafood and the sauce is flavorful with a nice spicy kick to it. I also tried the signature kimchi fried rice with high hopes since so many people raved about it but when it came out the fried rice was dry and bland." u"My new go-to in K-Town the doorway gets packed and the restaurant itself doesn't know the meaning of 'personal space' but I'll be damned if the food ain't worth it!\n\nThere is always an interesting variety of banchan at Five Senses and there's always an interesting mix of non-korean vegetables in their food in general. I mean please correct me if I'm wrong but brussels sprouts in a bokkeum??? But it's like - omg brussels sprouts in a bokkeum!!!!!!!! It's crunchy and perfect and I love it. As I love everything else I've ordered from here. \n\nFood's just a liiiittle on the pricier side but the portions are quite large so I really can't complain." u"Come for the lunch prices! Hot comforting Korean stew was just what I needed for a cold day. The food is a little average for it's high price but it gets you satisfied." u"Wow this place exceeded expectations! We came as a group of two around 1pm and were seated right away. Our table was right by the kitchen so one of us had to sit on the side of table by the wall so that people from the kitchen could get by. Kinda inconvenient but it turned out to be fine. I didn't have any problems with the service - the Korean ahjumma who took our order wasn't the most welcoming but that's nothing new for Korean restaurants. The younger servers were very nice. The banchan was good including kimchi fish cake (odeng) and a tasty spicy fish dish. \n\nI got the seafood soon dubu and my sister got the LA galbi and bibim naengmyun (both are lunch specials). The soon dubu came out still boiling and the portion was huge. This might have been one of the best soon dubu's I've eaten (and soon dubu is like my favorite food)! It was a good level of spiciness (spicy but not painfully so) and the broth was very flavorful. They gave a lot of seafood AND a lot of tofu AND a lot of broth. Thumbs up I would come back here and recommend this place to friends!"],0.4199,0.202,0.798,0.0
158.Casellula,[u'I can\'t say enough! Exquisite! From the wine/cheese pairing to the spinach dip "pig\'s ass" pork sandwich -- and to top it off a magnificent chocolate cake covered in fresh cream! \n\nPerfect place to grab a bite to eat before a Broadway show especially if you forgot to make a reservation somewhere. Casellula is great for walk-ins!' u"I came in on a Tuesday evening around 7 PM and there were a few open tables. Definitely very busy definitely postwork crowd. We did not have to wait for a table which is great because they don't take reservations.\n\nWhen you first look at the menu and can be quite daunting. A lot of the cheeses and winds are very unique to this store so you won't be able to recognize them. However the waiters and waitresses here are amazing at giving recommendations. I simply told them what I'd like it and they pair the cheese for us. They gave us a great selection of hard and soft cheeses with different kinds of milk. They were very sensitive to allergies and preferences as well. I wish I could tell you what we had but trust me when I say just trust your waiter.\n\nOverall the place got very loud so it was difficult to hold a conversation at times but it's a great place to bring someone if you'd like to simply have a conversation!" u"An intimate wine bar in Hell's Kitchen. Besides other small snacks I think the best part about this wine bar is that you can have experts pair cheese and meat for the wines you're drinking. I don't quite remember what the three cheeses we ordered were because my cheese palate is quite crude but I thought they were all excellent choices and went well with both the wines and the meats.\n\nI think the place would be great for dates because the place is fairly small and intimate and the dim lighting and the quiet music make for a great setting for dates. I'd definitely come back here for intimate conversations." u"The ambience was nice and I like wine cheese and small plates. But while the service was nice enough it was bordering on neglectful. We sat at the bar and after we ordered there wasn't much follow up and it was hard to get the waitress' attention as she wasn't exclusively behind the bar. The chicken liver p\xe2t\xe9 was tasty but came with like 7 tiny pieces of baguette and it was hard getting someone's attention for more. The mac and cheese completely lacked salt. Meaning I think no salt was added at any point to this dish. I'm not a big salt person either and less is more in general for me but this had NONE and it really needed *some*. Overall disappointed." u'The place was busy and packed but we were seated immediately. We went for a pre-show snack. We had a cheese plate paired by a fantastic red wine blend. I definitely recommend this spot!' u'I recommend this place of you like wine and cheese! The cheese plate was delicious as well as many of their small plates. Cozy environment likely good for groups of 2-4 people or come early. I will go back!' u'Definitely a hidden gem. We were quite a large party and they were really accommodating. The wine selection is great (by the glass or by the bottle) the food was tasty and the cheese was great. The decor is nothing special but the place feels intimate and welcoming. The staff was knowledgeable about wine. We had a wonderful time.' u'Very nice venue- good location small but cozy cute  good lighting. Offered excellent selection of wine and cheese. We ordered meat plate cheese plate and ricotta crostini. Everything was delicious but especially loved ricotta crostini. Must try!  \n\nThe highlight of the night was seeing Andrew Rannells from the new normal!! It seemed that he comes pretty often. \n\nOne thing to note is that since the space is limited and the tables are small its not suitable for big parties.\n\nOverall very nice experience :)' u'Romantic wine bar tucked away off of ninth avenue offering up a significant wine list and some moderate bites. Monday evening and plenty of space at both the bar and the tables. \n\nAfter getting a seat at the bar settled on a couple of glasses of their Spanish red wine ($12 each). Pour is generous though price is still a bit high and tasted excellent. For food shared the Seasonal Crostini ($12) and Roasted Eggplant ($12). Crostini is three small slices of bread with rich ricotta and diced shiitake mushrooms. Strong flavor yet a bit small for the price. Roasted eggplant came out next - three slivers of eggplant drenched in oil and some feta cheese crumbled over. Soft to eat but a little overrun with oil; better with more feta cheese on top. Again as a shared plate was hoping for more than just three slices.\n\nService here is excellent with our food and drink coming fairly quickly. Overall if you are to come here the best bet is to share a bottle over some conversation. 3.5 stars.' u"We stumbled upon this place to get a quick bite before a show and BOY were we lucky! This small place had one last table - at the front window! - just for us. Our server was friendly and quick! We split a bunch of small plates: watermelon salad spicy kale salad gazpacho and the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. Everything was beautifully presented and the grilled cheese sandwich was THE BEST I've ever had. (At $16 it should be...) Kinda pricy but quality ingredients and terrific flavors! We'll return!!!!" u"Casellula is a cute place with limited seating I swung in for a quick glass of Finca Decro Cabernet as well as a small cheese platter.\n\nWhat threw me was the size of the place I can see this place getting packed out during the summer. I'm not sure if I'll be back because of the tight space" u"While visiting my former neighborhood Hell's Kitchen my husband and I were looking for a good happy hour spot with a decent beer selection. Every one we stopped into was SO disarmingly loud we immediately walked out again. Then we got to Casellula and it seemed open and airy and not nearly as noisy (thanks in part to the patio and open windows I presume). We settled in at the bar and had a couple rounds. Our bartender Leah was extremely knowledgeable friendly and gave us a lot of good recs for breweries and distilleries to check out in the area. If I still lived in the neighborhood I have a feeling I'd be a regular at Casellula! They call themselves a wine bar but there's hardly any kind of beer or liquor they don't stop. Two thumbs up!" u"This is a fantastic date location! Great romantic intimate restaurant for wine and cheese.\n\nI've been to Casellula twice now. The restaurant is usually pretty full but there always seems to be at least a table or two open - especially if you come later in the night (post 8pm). \n\nBoth times I ordered cheese and meat plates with wine. The cheese plates that I had were AMAZING. They will pick cheeses for you and pair them with a sauce. Last time I went I had a passionfruit spread with a very creamy cheese and an apple spread with another soft cheese. Each cheese costs $7 and you can order as many or as little as you want (I recommend 3-5).\n\nThe restaurant can pair cheeses according to the wine choice you make. Their meat platters are pre-set with whatever they have for the evening. \n\nI would also highly recommend the Pig's Ass sandwich. The meat is extremely tender and served with the most amazing sauce. The sauce is seriously so good.\n\nFood: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nAmbiance: 5/5\nValue: 4/5" u"My friends and I had a delightful dinner at Casellula! The chef and FOH staff were all so friendly and made wonderful recommendations! If I lived here I'd be a regular for sure!" u"Pig sandwich cheese flights and amazing pates. What's not to like?? Well often a long wait and no reservation policy... can make for tricky planning in this cramped spot. Sometimes borders on being trendy but given the flavors delivered there is more substance than sizzle here (often not the case in NYC!) Solid 4 stars." u"Continues being a great choice for wine and cheese lovers. It's nice seeing businesses keeping high the quality and service throughout the years!" u'I\'ve been here several times. Except for the summer - when business is noticeably lighter - you typically can\'t get one of the few tables in this small space without a wait. I\'ve always sat at the bar (which also fills up btw). \n\nBecause it\'s a small space and very busy it\'s also really noisy. In nicer weather the door is often open however and the super high ceiling and wall of windows on the street helps to make the noise level a little more tolerable. \n\nService is mostly good - can be spotty. The food is tapas style which requires frequent re-ordering through the meal and it can often be difficult to get a servers attention when it gets too busy. Also a bar that doesn\'t automatically place a glass of water in front of you is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and this is one of those places... \n\nThe food is really delicious though - most of it showcasing one or more of their many cheeses. They have one of the best mac & cheeses I\'ve had spinach & cheese dip burrata with roasted peppers pulled pork sandwich with yet another melty cheese... as far as I can tell you can\'t go wrong on the menu. They also offer custom cheese and charcuterie plates which always have some unique pairing that perfectly complements (last night they paired a blond fudge with a delicious blue cheese - incredible!). \n\nAnother specialty is their wine and with a few exceptions they will likely be bottles you\'ve never heard of. I\'m always a little skeptical of these obscure "curated" wine lists but so far I\'ve been pleasantly surprised. \n\nI think what makes all of this work is the really cute only-in-NY neighborhood sophisticated-yet-cool feel of the space. In Hells Kitchen these spots are rare. I\'d recommend in a heartbeat. Would be especially good for a first date!' u'I went alone (as per usual) and sat at the bar. I felt completely comfortable and the white wine was amazing decent pours. I tried two types of cheese which were paired with a spread and bread I left the chef pick. The French goat cheese was not my taste but the hard Spanish cheese was veryyy good. I would 100% take friends and go back.' u'This place is one of my regular haunts in the neigborhood.  Staff is always so lovely and very knowledgeable about their wine and cheese.  As many others have noted the atmosphere is really warm and cozy.  Perfect place for a date or just a fun meal with a good friend.  It is by far one of the best cheese plates you will ever have.  Trust the staff and let them put together a cheese plate for you.  You will be happy.  Make sure you have a truffle before you leave!' u"I really enjoyed my visit to Casellula! As soon as I saw a cheese knife on my table in favor of a steak knife I knew I was in the right spot. My friend and I were seated next to the window so we were able to do a little people watching while we waited for our food.\n\nWe opted for a bottle of ros\xe9 and our server noted that their fromager would pair the bottle with a few selections of cheese based on our preferences. Since we love *all* the cheese we were provided with a beautiful platter of three cheeses paired with spreads and dried fruits/nuts. The most memorable to me was a brie paired with passion fruit spread ... I honestly couldn't get enough and still think about it from time to time (meaning I'll definitely be back for more).\n\nThe meat platter was a great pairing and we ended up scarfing up an order of mac and cheese along with it. Next time I'd love to try some more of the shareable plates since the food was so delicious. Excellent service and food and great ambiance for a date or social gathering."],0.8316,0.438,0.562,0.0
31.OBAO,[u"I love wandering NYC and finding new restaurants but I needed to work from my hotel and order delivery. OBAO was the perfect choice! Pad Thai with dumplings met the $10 minimum order.  I asked for 'medium' heat --- but it arrived milder than expected so don't be afraid to boost the heat level here.\n\nThe poached egg made the takeout dish rich and luxurious. A great addition. Delivery was to my room and paid for in Yelp. Easy!" u"Found this place on yelp highly praised...so I decided to try it for the first time for dinner arrived at 5:44pm...No tables available bar seats only ....Wait is about 20-30mins for a table\n\nOverall this was an overpriced Vietnamese restaurant but because it's manhattan and it's within a ten block radius from Time Sq...It was expected. But the happy hour drinks were great for $8 cocktails. They have a good bartender.\n\nThey have rough 7-8 staff working the floor plus the hostess and bartender. So roughly ten people but they are popular and busy...\n\nThe highlight of this evening...\n1) If you ever need recommdations ask Ali she was spot on with everything....And very friendly she checked on me throughout my whole dinning experience.\n\n2) Their nicely well hiden Bathroom was very clean and had a rustic feel to it. Who ever designed the sink...Props...\n \n3) Being surprised that they have \nMichelin Recommended icon next to dishes...\nSpare rib on sugar cane skewer $9 \nBo Luc Lac $17\nBun ($11-$14 with your choice of Sauteed flank steak grilled pork and shrimp sauteed chicken or sauteed vegetables)\nOrdered it with pork and shrimp.\nLast item was Pho Bo $14 but didn't order it...\nSambal spiced calamari $10\n\nIt was underwhelming....Except the spare rib on sugar skewers that was interesting\n\nLastly the setting looks cute for date night....That is unless you're allergic to dusts.....They haven't cleaned those lights in a while...Saw quite a few dust bunnies..." u"Decided to try this place with my sister because of the reviews and because we were nearby. The place is very cute nicely decorated but the light bulbs decoration that we sat under were very dusty (I am allergic but I am glad I didn't start sneezing like crazy). First floor is small and has few tables not sure  about upstairs. \n\nWe ordered two Thai iced teas ($4 ea) Pad Thai ($14) Pad See Iew ($14). Food came out fast and presentation was good. The Thai iced teas were really good no complaints. My sister commented on the pad see iew being on the small portion side but it had a generous amount of meat and was tasty. As for the pad thai when popping the poached egg I realized that all the noodles were clumped up (not sure for how long they were sitting there) and when eating I am not sure if it was because of the poached egg but the dish felt heavy noodles were dense and I had to drink a lot of water and tea to be able to finish my food. \n\nAt the beginning I was debating whether to order the Khao Soi or the Pad Thai. Should've ordered the Khao Soi instead. Will I come back? Yes but only to try the Khao Soi nothing else caught my attention and the pad thai was dissappointing." u'2 hour delivery. 45 minutes "out for delivery". Do yourself a favor find a different place to order.\n\nUpdate: Got food poisoning.' u"My mom and I came here before a Broadway show on a weeknight and while we had a decent dinner I was not really impressed. The interior space is beautifully decorated with whimsical lighting but the food left something to be desired.\n\nI tried not to let the B grade from the health department posted outside deter me because I'd already made a reservation and did not want to look for another restaurant last minute. We were seated upstairs right away. The service was good... our waitress checked on us frequently and was able to answer questions about the menu.\n\nWe tried the vegetable spring rolls and the chicken and shrimp dumplings from the app menu and got just one entree the crispy duck red curry. The vegetable spring rolls would have been good except they were just too salty. The dumplings were mediocre... no specific complaints but I have no desire to eat them again. I liked some aspects of the duck curry such as how the broth was seasoned well and the vegetables and fruits (pineapple and lychee) in it were nice. However the duck was not tender and was hard to cut off the bone so that was disappointing because I usually love duck in Thai food." u"I would say that the food here(after my one visit here in October) is closer to 3.5 stars however the lively mood and decor which creates a fun atmosphere drives this closer to 4 stars in my book so I'll round up.\n\nWe shared several not memorable dishes but what I do remember is the Kimchi Fries which were maybe the most amazing fries I've ever had. Yeah trust me that's saying something. What I definitely did not like was the Tom Yum soup which was bland and almost tasteless to me and yeah I've had a lot of Tom Yum soup growing up and living in the Bay Area.\n\nSince we had to wait for our table even though we had a reservation we decided to have a drink at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helpful. Our drinks were super strong which was perfectly fine by me. The service here was pleasant and overall our experience was solid." u'Yelp definitely steered me in the right direction with this place! Came here for my lunch break looking for some authentic Vietnamese food. Not only did I get great food but the inside of this restaurant is amazing. The memorizing light fixtures on the ceiling and Buddha statues in the back transport you to a far off world of elegance of zen. \n\nThey have a great lunch special with an appetizer and a main for only 9$. I went with the Obao salad and the Pho Bo. The tofu in the salad was surprisingly dry and shriveled but still had some good flavor. But the peanut sauce on the salad was out of this world amazing! Like drink it right out of the bowl good which I may or may not have done..... The Pho was tasty as well. The thin sliced steak in the Pho was really the shining star of that dish. So tender and flavorful. When I saw a nearby table get served the Pad Thai I immediately got order envy. Will definitely have to return to try the Pad Thai!' u"Again on the hunt for Bun Bo Hue I decided to give it a try here. I came here on a Friday night around 10 PM and we had to wait around 15 min.\n\nPros:\n-The flavor of the broth here is acceptable but not the greatest. I felt that they could have added more lemongrass because I honestly did not taste it that much.\n-Even though it was not very spicy they gave chili flakes on the side which made it taste better. Together with the lime the broth was actually somewhat decent.\n-The decor was very nice; a fusion between traditional and hip decor. They were blasting EDM music which I thought was interesting but I get it.\n\nCons:\n-Price and portion size. The bun bo hue was $14 and it didn't come with that many noodles. I wish they just gave a little bit more.\n-I could definitely tell that it is Americanized but that can be a good or bad thing. The meats they used were brisket and pork belly which isn't traditionally used. I can see why they did that though.\n-Too much meat (for me). They gave so much pork belly! For once I thought the meat/noodle ratio was off but opposite to what you would expect. The pork belly was also a bit weird for me since it's the type that belongs in ramen or something.\n\nOverall this place is fun but pricey and the portion sizes aren't great. My friend previously told me about their lunch specials and I did glance at them. They seemed more affordable and I believe they start at around $9." u'We were seated very quickly for lunch. Workers were attentive and friendly. The drinks were soooooooo tasty. Highly recommend the Flunk Flink and Fig-a-tini. The flunk flink was fantastic. It was sweet and tasted like lychee soaked in vanilla liquor (so delicious). We also tried the fig-a-tini which was just as tasty and not over powering-ly sweet. I would go back just for the drinks!' u"My favorite Thai spot in Hell's Kitchen. And not because it's an intimate cute Thai couple that makes the perfect Chiang Mai Khao Soi. I love coming here b/c there is happy hour it's fun yes it trendy and they make some amazing Banh Mis and Pad See Ews.\n\nThings to Note:\n1) Get the Thai over Vietnamese offerings (No Pho) except the Banh Mis are delicious\n2) Love the Kimchi Fries\n3) Pad See Ew is delicious and large enough to share\n4) Make reservations online\n5) Always sit at the bar for cocktails\n6) Two floors and lots of room for groups\n7) Pass on the Tom Yum Soup\n8) Excellence cocktails\n\nI really love this place but if you need some authentic Khao Soi while the curry soup is good - it is slightly salty. So I'm still in search for that perfect curry noodle pickled soup.\n\nBut come here b/c you can actually get a reservations online while enjoying some pretty decent Thai food." u"I finally came to dine in. We had reservations before and good thing we did. The restaurant was packed when we arrived Friday night and still packed after we left. Though we had reservations we still had to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated. \n\nThis location takes up two floors but like most restaurants in the city the tables are pretty close together. I came with five other friends and we were seated on the second floor in a narrow table in the center of the space. Throughout the night the serving staff would be squeezing past us to serve other diners in the back. It wasn't super uncomfortable but it was noticeable. \n\nWe ordered the sambal spiced calamari ($10) pork belly ($9) and two spare ribs on sugarcane skewers ($9) for our appetizers. Each was good but not amazing. The spare ribs were my least favorite. The meat was chewy and it was hard to tell if we were supposed to swallow the sugarcane or not. I guess that's up to personal preference. \n\nI ordered the khao soi ($12) as my main. The portion was very generous and the flavors were on point. I believe that the kitchen is on the first floor so by the time the dishes arrive to the second they were warm not hot. After digging around in my noodle soup I found clumps of egg noodles (not a fan). \n\nIt seems that Obao does Thai better than it does Vietnamese. My friends who ordered the pho were disappointed by the portion size and the taste. Those of us who ordered the Thai dishes had no complaints. \n\nThough my take out experience was better than my dine in experience Obao is a good place for a date night or dinner with friends. It may not be the best Thai or Vietnamese food (though you're better off ordering Thai) but the prices are fair and the service is decent." u"I was looking for a place to go in Hell's Kitchen with a friend and I am so glad I stumbled upon Obao! I had an excellent dining experience from the quality of food to the atmosphere to the service. If you're looking for an Asian fusion restaurant to take a close friend or date then this is the perfect place. Now onto my experience. \n\nImmediately on entering you notice that the design of this place is spectacular. There are pretty lanterns hanging from the ceiling which creates a beautiful decor. Their menu really has something for everyone and has dishes from both Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. \n\nMy friend and I decided to order three dishes and share them which worked out great. We got the cashew chicken the flank steak banh mi and the pad kee mao (noodles and chicken). The cashew chicken had crispy pieces of fried chicken with vegetables roasted cashews and a sweet and savory sauce. The flank steak banh mi came with chopped pieces of steak in a baguette served with a spicy mayo. It was absolutely delicious my friend and I got sriracha sauce to put on top of it and that really took it to another level. Last the pad kee mao came with lots of tender sliced chicken and wide rice noodles. The basil flavor really stuck out in this dish. The pad kee mao was actually my favorite out of all the dishes and I am not even a huge noodle fan. Our total came out to $40 ($20 pp) which I thought was totally reasonable. \n\nNext time I will have to try the pho as the table next to me got it and it looked so good! Overall a great place in HK to go for dinner with great value and excellent service." u"I always hate giving negative reviews but my lunch here was far from great.  We took advantage of the lunch menu which comes with your choice of appetizer with entree.  I had the Steamed Dumplings to start with and the Kui Teaw Laksa for my entree.  Both of the items were bad.  The dough from the steamed dumplings was overcooked so it was falling apart.  But the components inside tasted very grainy; it was quite odd.  There were two dumplings for the appetizer but I only finished half of one.  However the Kui Teaw Laksa was worse unfortunately.  I really like laksa for the coconut milk base and how spicy it is but neither was the case here.  The soup base was super water-y so seemed to not have much coconut milk in it.  And it was not spicy at all which is how I prefer my laksas to be.  Even with the chili flakes on the side I had to dump all of the flakes in it for any kind of spice in my soup.  It was hardly noticeable even after that since the base was so water-y.  It was as if it drowned out any kind of spice or flavoring.  It was very bland as if it hadn't been seasoned which is definitely not the case with laksas.  Of the dish - I liked the three pieces of prawns in the soup but everything else was disappointing. \n\nService on the other hand was a positive especially from our hostess.  We had planned to head to the airport after this lunch so she allowed us to store our luggage in the storage closet.  But I can't say I'd be back given the lackluster food.  It was a waste of a $14 lunch so would advise to eat elsewhere." u"The food here is absolutely delicious but I'm not sure whether they use MSG or not. I had the Khao Soi (curry noodle) and it was delicious. However I was VERY thirsty afterwards for like 8 hours and drank a lot of water. Not sure if it's from Obao but everything else I ate that day was the same as my mom and she wasn't thirsty at all so I think it was the Khao Soi. My mom got the curry duck entree which she really liked. We also shared the Spare Ribs On Sugar Cane Skewer and that was really delicious too. I wish they had put more meat on the skewer but the taste was on point.\n\nService... oh the service. I hadn't even finished my dish and the waiter was about to take my plate. I had to tell him I wasn't done yet. Then when I put the last spoonful in my mouth and haven't even chewed the food the waiter came back again and took my plate away. Like darling what's the hurry? There are so many tables open yet and it isn't even lunch/dinner rush hour. It left me in quite an agitated and unsatisfied mood. Overall good food but a lot of room for improvement in terms of service and quality of food." u"Stopped by this place because of their decor! The place is simply beautiful and well designed.\n\nEven though it's a bit of a walk from the train station their food is certainly worth it. Their lunch special is also great! A very small price for the amount of food they give you. Everyone here is friendly and very accommodating. It's also great that I work a few blocks away from here so I'm able to get my OBAO fix. \n\nTry their thai ice tea! It's not watered down compared to other places :)" u"EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing. All great flavors and the group of four of us ate every last bite.   \n\nI don't typically order fruity drinks but the cocktail I ordered off of their specialty drinks menu was good. I ordered the Flunk Flink.  I suggest you try it or one of the specialty cocktails just because you can. \n\nOne more thing... this might be weird but.... if you order your cocktail at the bar close your tab and make sure to immediately tell the host you closed your tab so that they can seat you right away." u"We were looking for a place by one of the local theaters so that a friend of mine could grab a bite with us and then head over to dinner. Obao appeared on the list of Yelp recommended locations and I hadn't had Thai in a while. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the friendly staff and ordered  a drink while we waited on a friend cabbing over. The cocktails were really yummy and had some creative combinations of tropical flavors. Some were sweet while others had a lightly spicy kick. My personal favorite was the Fig-A-Tini but I also enjoyed the Flunk Flink!\n\nThe wait staff was attentive and the environment was absolutely gorgeous. The lamps downstairs had an incredible visual effect especially coupled with the Thai statues against the back wall. The upstairs vibe was also very effective with thousands of little bells on the ceiling and the bamboo umbrella chandelier. My only negative comment was that the downstairs lamps could use a bit of a dusting. Outside of that it was a super cool effect.\n\nWhen our apps arrived we shared to get  a taste of everything. I was thrilled with my Steamed Dumplings (shrimp & pork) and the Crispy Vegetable Spring Rolls were very good -- slightly different from other places with a soy dipping sauce instead of the typical sweet chile sauce but good nonetheless. My friend's Tom Yum Soup was very good but bordering on way too spicy for all three of us. Finally the papaya salad was very good and had just the right amount of kick without going overboard. \n\nFor my meal I ordered Khao Soi (Chiang Mai Noodles) which is a northern Thai style crispy egg noodle curry with chicken pickled cabbage red onion and bean sprouts. It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be looking for that in other restaurants moving forward. It was prepared like a coconut and yellow curry soup had a small kick to it and really blew my socks off. Great job Obao! I'll definitely be revisiting on my next trip to NYC." u"The food and service was great. You must try the spicy calamari! The drinks are a bit pricey even with the happy hour but it's not a deal breaker for me. I will definitely return to the spot. It's great for date night and a get together with friends." u"Came here for lunch and for ~$13 grand total I was delighted! The restaurant has a nice vibe and well kept. They have a wonderful lunch selection that offers a $9 lunch entree w/ complimentary appetizer. This lunch menu doesn't have much for vegetarians (2-3 options) but I was rather content w/ my mixed vegetables tofu and grilled eggplant -- everything was served hot and seasoned well (not just salt). \n\nService was wonderful too! Very accommodating from bringing three separate checks and agreeing to fill up my water bottle on a rather hot/sunny day. Really appreciated that!!" u"It was raining heavily last night and I began craving hot Asian food. I looked through a list of restaurants I've been meaning to check out and braved my way through the downpour to Hell's Kitchen. It was definitely bustling this place. We had to wait a few minutes in spite of a table reservation because I guess no one wanted to get back out into the rain after dining in this warm beautifully lit place.\n\nI'm a vegetarian and when it comes to Thai food I don't particularly like the strong flavour of fish/shrimp paste in my food. We ordered the vegetable spring rolls to share and they were delicious. For my entree I tried the bun noodles with vegetables which were michelin recommended and the only vegetarian noodle entree on the menu. It was beyond delicious - super fresh green light and perfectly seasoned. I absolutely did not expect it to be so delicately balanced in flavour. I'd come back for more!\n\nService was a bit slow or perhaps our table was too far back and really cramped for the server to take notice. But that's my only complain everything else was fantastic."],-0.3612,0.0,0.762,0.238
164.Junior’s,[u"I would usually avoid eating anywhere that is located right in Times Square but due to some powerful rain and the fact that I was attending an event located next door I found myself at Junior's on Sunday afternoon. I'll be honest this place looks fantastic from the outside and just as cool when you walk in.  When you walk in you are greeted and seated as you walk past the giant light-up Junior's sign and a plethora or desserts. Once seated our waiter came to the table and won me over immediately why? Because he knew we were there for wrestling and he knew his stuff. The menu here is massive and pretty much offers anything you can think of (for an American style dinerish menu). I ended up ordering the steakhouse burger which came was French fries and some of the biggest onion rings I have ever seen in my life. \n\nThe steakhouse burger was just what I wanted in a burger it was juicy it was big and it was a burger (the three keys really). The fries were pretty basic diner style fries but they were very good. The onion rings actually disappointed me which was not expected. When I took my first bite the same thing I was most excited for ended up being too much and that's the breading. The breading is actually too thick like it doesn't taste like an onion ring which is what I was hoping for. When you bite into it you almost feel like you are biting into a sweet treat rather then an onion ring they weren't terrible just not what I was hoping for. Overall I loved coming to Junior's and would absolutely come back. The staff was friendly and informative the food was delicious and the atmosphere was just what you would want from a New York City restaurant." u"You pretty much will get what you expect. \n\nIf you are looking to satisfy your sugar/pastry (is cheesecake considered a pastry) needs then Junior's is for you. You pretty much will have a wide range of various types of cheesecakes that are around 7-9 bucks a slice. Keep in mind that the cake slices are HUGE and you probably could split one slice between a couple of people. \n\nThe cheesecakes are pretty standard since Junior's now is a commercial brand. The restaurant is really nice and clean. I would say that the service could use a little work. A friend and I stopped by on a Monday evening and it took a while to place an order even though the restaurant was not crowded. At one point all of the servers pretty much were bunched up chatting and hanging out. I mean can I get a glass of water?" u"You will definitely find cheesecake at Junior's but it's not necessarily the best. Given it's location it can only be described as a tourist trap.\n\nWhile the cheesecake is creamy it's also super thick and heavy which is not what I'm looking for in a cheesecake. The fruit topping is nice but I'm not a fan of that thick jelly like substance that covers the strawberry and pineapple.\n\nA lackluster cheesecake I'd save my money for elsewhere." u"[499]\n\nIf I am in Times Square and I see Junior's cheesecake I have to walk in and buy a cheesecake. \n\nThe meal line was long so we didn't sit in and order food.  We went to the walk up counter and purchased as small blueberry cheesecake $22.  The staff was nice enough to provide a cake slicer forks plates and napkins.  Everything you need in order to eat outside or in your hotel room.\n\nHubby LOVED the cheesecake and said we need to pick one up each time we are in NYC.\n\nKid had a cookie and ate each crumb.\n\nI'll definitely be back." u"Juniors has some of the most delicious cheesecake that I've ever tasted. I prefer the red velvet cheesecake- and I usually don't even like red velvet! Juniors is a NYC staple that you must have whenever you are visiting. My advice is to go and try it for yourself!" u'Large portions of cheesecake slices. Love the key lime one but after a few bites it was too sweet just like the rest of the cheesecakes.  They have this milkshake with a massive slice of cake on top. Def. something to get for an occasion! They also offer food too which kinda reminds me of Cheesecake Factory dishes.  \n\nThe pastrami egg roll was pretty tasty. Chicken parm was okay. The meat was a bit dry.' u"After a hard two days pounding the pavement of NYC we decided to get up a little early and visit Juniors. It is right across the street from our hotel in Times Square. This place is a wonder. It's exactly what I was looking for in a NYC Diner. The coffee is shockingly great but coming from the Midwest that's almost expected. The interior is bright and shiny the music is delightful and the atmosphere here makes me happy. \n\nThis and all the rest of my experiences here are all conspiring to make me fall in head over heels love with the city." u'Rated solely for the cheesecake....worth the trip just for that. Oh yes they have chairs silverware tables servers and other stuff.' u'Nice place for lunch...Kira our waitress was very nice but the food we ordered was just so-so. The onion rings are way to greasy and too much fluff. My soup was kind of bland tasting: my wife did like her Ruben Sandwich' u"I looked this place up in preparation for my trip to NY.  I saw a video about their cheesecake and knew I had to eat here.  I went with the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Reuben.  It was the best sandwich I've had since I came to NYC.  The corned beef was moist and the sauerkraut and Russian dressing were a welcome addition to the sandwich.   I was plenty full just after the Reuben but I couldn't say no to some cheesecake.  I ordered the red velvet cheesecake.  Delicious!  So glad I made it here." u"A huge tourist trap. Don't be fooled by the large slices of cheesecake this is a classic case of quantity over quality. I've tried the strawberry and pineapple cheesecakes both were mediocre. The cheesecake part is a little too thick and coats your entire mouth while the fruit topping is way too sweet. I would have liked the crust to be more present as well but sadly there was only the ever so slightest sliver of soggy graham cracker at the bottom." u'Disappointing...went for the famous cheesecake.  Ordered a cherry cheesecake.  The cheesecake part tasted like a block of cream cheese.  For some reason they put the cheesecake on some kind of weird cake on the bottom and some Graham cracker crust on top.  As far as proportions way too much cheesecake and not enough Graham cracker and cherries.  $7.95 for a slice.' u"We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday! And I'm glad we did since they gave us a candle to blow out. We actually didn't come here to dine but for dessert. Decent choice but I found that the desserts were just okay. Nothing too special. We got three of them and even with five of us present and eating we couldn't even finish it all. Perhaps we were already full from eating pizza earlier but it also was not tasty enough to motivate us to finish it all. I will give our waiter props for excellent service though!" u"So happy it's right across from our hotel Marriott Marquis.    Service = attentive & very good overall.\nPrices fair (for NY) portions -large.\nAte breakfast here for our entire week stay. Never disappointed!" u'Great food. Excellent service!!!  Patrick the waiter was GREAT!!!!!  He was attentive and friendly!!!!  Huge portions!!!  Thank you' u'I finally made it to Juniors in NYC. I had the pleasure of tasting this sumptuous cheesecake on my birthday. My work family surprised me with a cake delivered to me at work and it was a very pleasant surprise. I still remember the explosion of taste in my mouth when I first had it. So when we planned to visit NY for our vacation i made sure to tell my family that we were definitely stopping here. It was literally 5 minutes walk from our hotel in  Times Square. I would have hand carried one home if I was not on a diet.' u'Junior\'s is a class NYC experience! They are claimed to have "World\'s Famous Cheesecake." I\'ve been twice before and every time I go there is never enough room for dessert! The portions though a tad on the expensive side are large and the price is comparable to other places around the Times Square area. The menu is huge with many different choices. There is something for everyone. I took my sister here who is a picky eater. They have good American diner cuisine for folks who aren\'t as adventurous in their culinary tastes but still a wide enough variety to please everyone. The servers are also friendly and efficient...we we\'re seated in less than 10 minutes on a busy Friday night! The atmosphere is also very enjoyable - kind of a retro 50s vibe but nicer than a typical "diner." Very good if you are in this area!' u"If you're craving for cheesecakes then this place is definitely on top of the list. Other things in the menu are just typical american food." u"Omg get ready to share food. 1 palate can feed 2 people. The cheese cake out of this world. I had th BBQ chicken. It's a lot of food as you can see my cousin had a sandwich it was huge. The give you beets coleslaw and pickles. To snack on..." u"Got a slice of the original cheesecake. It's pretty good but I would make sure to share it with someone. It's a large slice super creamy and dense. My only wish is that it had more of a crust at the bottom. Overall it's very good but after the first few bites it gets a little boring. \nThis location is absolutely gorgeous."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
62.Bengal Tiger Indian Food,[u"In town for work and Bengal Tiger caught my eye with 4.5 stars and nearly 1000 reviews. It's a fast casual lunch but a full service sit down dinner. So I went for dinner and it lived up to the reviews. \n\nI opted for the three-course menu which includes an app entree and taste of rice pudding for $21. Great deal it you ask me. \nI started with the Keema Samosa which was good not overly greasy or anything and served with very tasty mint and tamarind chutneys.\nThen the chicken korma which was even better - deliciously creamy cashew sauce. One of the better kormas I've had - would definitely recommend. \nThe rice pudding was just a couple spoonfuls (but effectively free) but even the rice pudding was really good. And I don't normally like rice pudding.\n\nDefinitely returning the next time I'm in New York" u'Fast casual at lunch and sit down at dinner Bengal Tiger serves traditional Indian food at a great price and with warm welcoming service.\nGo up a flight of fluorescent lighted stairs to a narrow dining room with takeout delivery and table service available for dinner and takeout delivery and counter service available at lunch. The staff is highly efficient and also very welcoming. There can be a wait for a table at dinner but the service is fast and tables open quickly.\nOrder based on your own favorites - I love the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Saag. The rice pudding is a wonderful but decadent ending to lunch or dinner.' u'Have been here multiple times and really enjoy the food. I usually order the Chicken Makhani which reminds me of butter chicken. The most recent time I visited however the chicken pieces were rather large and drier than usual. The naan and rice is delightful but I wish they included more rice given the portion size of the curries.\n\nThis most recent time my friend spotted a cockroach crawling around our table which was quite unfortunate. Despite that cockroach sighting Bengal Tiger is still a fave Indian spot.' u"1 star deducted because there was a cockroach crawling around on the ground.\n\nBut aside from the cockroach excellent Indian food joint nestled on the second floor of an ambiguous building.\n\nThe pakora was delicious; crispy yet not greasy and the green sauce in particular added a bit of a much needed spicy kick.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the chicken saag - great flavors but the chicken chunks were rather large and quite dry. A solid establishment that I wouldn't mind dropping by again in the future." u'Another great Indian restaurant in the city to grab lunch or take advantage of their pre fix dinner option. Most importantly  please check into Yelp to receive a free basket of fresh baked crispy nan!\n\nThey are located on the second floor filled with lots of space especially for large groups. Perfect place to grab lunch before going to one of the museums in the area or sightseeing in case you are visiting NYC!\n\nThey have the best delicious mango lassi! Yummy! \nFor appetizer a friend and I split an order of vegetable samosas. The samosas were more than enough to satisfy our hunger before having our main course. \n\nI had their extra spicy lamb vindaloo with basmati rice. I think that was the spiciest dish in the restaurant and my mouth was on fire just the way I wanted it to be. Please note you can always asked for your dish to be mild or medium spicy.\n\nThe lamb vindaloo just melted in my mouth. They served a good portion thats perfect for a party of two. \n\nOur waiter was amazing! Very friendly folks!' u"Definitely the best Indian food you can find in this part of town where the pickins are slim and i can say it is actually one of my fave Indian spots in the city! My boyfriend and I have made this one of our most frequented spots.\n\nThere is almost always a wait but the food is worth it - the minute I walked in I knew it was legit because it literally smelled like my best friend's mom's Indian home cooking :') and when the line gets long they'll give you naan to munch on and the naan here is not to be missed! So buttery so warm so soft the perfect vehicle to sop up all the sauces and curries!! Make sure to check in to get that free naan!\n\nThe food:\n\nSaag paneer - best I've ever had goes best with their super fragrant basmati rice doesn't feel very heavy! The cheese is very light.\n\nChicken tikka masala - classic. Hits the spot. Although when we got this I found the meat to be quite tough.\n\nChicken korma - thicker and sweeter than the tikka masala this went so well with the naan I preferred this over the tikka masala! The meat was very soft.\n\nTandoori chicken tikka - tandoor grilled chicken with masala spices comes with cucumber Raita. A match made in heave. GENEROUS portion. Def one of my fave dishes.\n\nChicken malai kabab appetizer - when you want a mini version of the entree my boyfriend and I like to order this a meat curry and a veggie curry and the portions are just right! This app comes with mint/cilantro chutney instead of cucumber Raita\n\nLamb Saag - Not a very memorable dish for me because I found the lamb to be too tough. Willing to try a diff version though cause personally I love lamb.\n\nVegetable tikka masala - not the best thing on the menu I think of it as more a dish you'd get if you feel the need to incorporate some veggies in your order but I'd skip this and opt for other dishes as this was kind of bland and just a mush of veggies.\n\nRasmalai - the desserts all looked so interesting and I've never had this one before because it's specifically of Bengali origin I was baited into getting it because our server told me that every Bengali will tell you that it's their favorite dessert. And boy did it not disappoint. The mild cheese went so well with the sweet milk cream sauce and the pistachio pieces. I can't really explain it you just have to try it for yourself.\n\nCome here if you want to experience Indian home cooking food. The only thing is that sometimes the meat in the curries can be inconsistent but I think that could be because of how busy this place can get. Tough meat or not it's just me giving a little tough love.\n\nRECOMMEND." u"Located on the second floor - easily missed if you don't look up at the sign! \n\nI was looking for a fast but good Indian place to eat by myself but was immediately intimidated when I went upstairs and found it to be a table like seating. I immediately left cause i didn't want to be seen as that loser who is eating a restaurant by herself. However I made a point to come back as there are so many good reviews for this place! I made my friend come meet me and try this place and was so surprised that this is actually not a restaurant! \n\nYou order first pay and then chose a place to sit and if you check in you get a free naan! The lunch combos are a pretty good deal. You get to order 2 types of entrees and rice and naan for the lunch special. Their mango lassi is pretty good too. I had the chicken vindaloo and it wasnt spicy at all but still good.\n\nThis place is super clean and a perfect place to come with friends or by yourself. It gets super busy once 12pm hits." u"Travel to midtown and go up a set of stairs on 56th st. and get ready to be transported to the wonderful Indian food experience that is Bengal Tiger. The restaurant itself is rather small so you may have to wait a little bit to snag a seat at peak hours but it's so worth it! \n\nThe service here is always super friendly and quick. Major props to whoever is filling up water too because my glass was always full - guy literally came to our table like 10 times during the meal for refills which is great when you're enjoying some spicy food. \n\nIf you're going to go for a starter I recommend checking out the keema samosas. The order comes with two but they are rather large and absolutely stuffed with lamb and the green pea turnover. \n\nI've had both the chicken tikka masala and the makhani and have truly enjoyed both. When you order you can choose to have the dish made regular or spicy so I always go for the spicy. It's not as hot as getting something like the vindaloo but it's got just enough spice to not be overboard. \n\nOf course a meal isn't complete without naan! They offer a few flavors other than regular so you can switch it up if you like. I however went with the original and used the Yelp check-in offer to get a free order. I also got a second order though since I'd recommend roughly one basket for every two people (we had 3) or if you just love naan (who doesn't?) and want more." u"Really great food and portions. I got the lamb saag and it was flavorful with a little hint of warmth. There was a lot of lamb chunks in it which was quite unexpected I almost wished there was more sauce so I can use my naan to sop up all of it. \nMango lassi was also not a miss can't really go wrong with it. \nService was good ambience was good. It's a tiny place that seats mostly two or four - definitely good for a cute dim-lighted date and not so much for big groups.\n\nWould come again!" u"SO YUMMY!!! \n\nThe space itself is pretty small and I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for two but it was totally worth it. The people who worked at the front were incredibly friendly and easy to talk to and made sure I was taken care of as soon as possible.\n\nMy boyfriend and I each ordered mango lassis a plate of pakoras to split and some regular naan. I ordered the saag paneer and he ordered the lamb saag. Our food was brought out at a reasonable time. The mango lassis are HUGE. We honestly could have split one; I was only able to drink half of mine. They're thick and delicious and not too sweet. The pakoras were divine. I've been eating pakoras from my college's mediocre dining hall for four years so I don't have much to compare it to but these pakoras were so delicious. I was sad when we had finished them because I could've eaten those forever. The naan was also wonderful with a really pleasant texture and good pull-apart-ability. I also loved the saag and the rice that came with it. There was so much food overall that I didn't even finish half of my saag paneer. \n\nI have absolutely zero complaints about Bengal Tiger. The food is amazing and the service is fantastic. I can't wait to go back!" u'Came to catch up with a friend over dinner here after she described this place as really really really good. I was like 3 "really"s let\'s go! And it did not disappoint!\n\nThings to keep note of:\n1. This restaurant is on the 2nd floor so you may miss it if you aren\'t paying attention or didn\'t know you had stairs to climb up first.\n2. Make sure you have your whole party with you before heading in as they\'re pretty busy and will pretty much ignore you until your whole party is there.\n\nWe started with veggie samosas which were very good and came out piping hot. The two sauces it came with were both delicious and each provided a different flavor profile so you could have some bites that were sweeter and some bites that were more savory. The only downside is that the server hovered right by our table as we were finishing up our samosas and took away the plate of sauces before I was finished. I only had 2 bites left so I didn\'t say anything.\n\nThey have vegetarian chicken and lamb curry sections. My friend and I got the vegetarian saag paneer and the chicken makhani. They both came with basmati rice but we also got orders of garlic naan and onion naan (if you check into Yelp you can get one free order of naan for the table!). There was definitely enough curry to go with both the rice and our naan. The curries were both delicious and the naan was overall wonderful and fluffy. There was one piece of naan that was sort of burnt and too crispy. And if you want some more spice like we did you can ask for peppers! They brought us a plate of peppers and onions; taking small bites of the peppers as we ate gave us the kick we were looking for.\n\nOverall great food and I would definitely recommend. Just next time I hope the employees will let us finish our food and not be in such a rush to take our plates away before we\'re done with their delicious food!' u"I was travel sick and while being hungry couldn't eat much because of the nausea. I ordered the mulligatawny soup to have something light and filling. While I do understand everyone has their own interpretations of the soup and it can be different in taste; I absolutely cannot fathom why would you bring out a soup without cooking the turmeric. This is not an American turmeric latte that I can let it pass by.. its an Indian restaurant screwing it up. The whole soup was just a big bowl of raw turmeric. \nMy boyfriend ordered the keema samosas and he said he could smell the stinking keema in it. Apparently my soup was better than his samosa and that's saying something.\nWe did eat it because we were so hungry but we would not ever come back here. No clue how this place has so many good reviews - maybe it was our bad luck." u"Could not have asked for better service! The guys who work here were so accommodating and polite. They must have refilled my water 5 times during my half hour there and I never drank more than a quarter of it it seemed like. This must be what it means to be waited on hand and foot. I came in close to 6pm on a Tuesday evening and there was no wait to get a primo table by the window.\n\nI was meeting a friend here right before attending a show at the August Wilson Theatre (a short walk from Bengal) and my friend was running later than expected. At one point I wasn't even sure if she would make it in time to eat. I relayed this information to the wait staff and they were great about getting her a plate just in case.\n\nI only ordered for one so I got the Chicken tikka masala which came with rice and some free naan with yelp check in. Thanks Yelp! I was able to choose between garlic or plain naan. Chicken tikka had the perfect proportion of cream vs tomato and a decent amount of chicken inside. I would definitely order it again and I was eyeing some of the patron's other dishes and everything looked delicious.\n\nMy friend ended up making it and the one dish easily filled both of us up enough to make it through the duration of the musical. If there's not much of a wait Bengal is an excellent option for traditional Indian." u'Wanted to try this highly rated Indian place. Stopped by and it definitely met exoectations. From the free naan (we ordered rosemary naan) lamb samosas to the truly "very spicy" chicken vindaloo -- was all delicious!\n\nThe restaurant was simple speedy clean nice service and delicious food -- the perfect combination.' u'Ordered the lamb korma extra spicy with naan. So the spice level was great but the flavor was a lil lacking on the korma scale. The naan was slightly off and chewy kind of but hard to describe even the texture was different.' u"I came here with my friends for dinner on a Thursday night around 6:30pm. \n\nWe ordered vegetable samosa garlic naan regular naan (free with yelp check-in) lamb vindaloo (medium spicy) and chicken tikka masala (little spicy) which came with rice bowls. \n\nVegetable samosa tasted more like a potato croquet. It was mediocre but not my favorite. However I enjoyed eating both curries with garlic naan. And when you mixed the curry into the rice it made it that much better. Chicken tikka masala is one of my favorite curry dishes. You have to get it. It's totally worth it!\n\nBy the way if you want to drink alcohol you can bring your own beer (BYOB) here. My friend decided to make a quick trip to Duane Reade close by and buy beer. We drank as we ate our food. \n\nThe only downfall of this place is that they rush customers. The waiters kept coming to our table at least 3 times asking if we're done. And the waiter had a heavy Indian accent. I am not against accents but my friends and I had a hard time understanding his speech. I repeated his words to make sure that I understood him correctly. \n\nI will definitely come back this restaurant if I'm craving Indian food in the city. :)" u'I Loved this place! I wish I lived closer so that I could eat here all of the time! We had the Vindaloo and the chicken tiki masala with garlic naan. \nYou should know that it is up a flight of stairs.' u'Got the Prix Fix menu (Veg samosa lamb vindaloo kheer) and an order of coconut naan.  They warned me the vindaloo is spicy and I told them 3 times to kick it up.  "Yes I know.  Indian Hot."  "Yes Sir!"  "10 out of 10 spicy."  "Yes Sir!" "And then add more spicy!"  "YES SIR!"  But man did they deliver.  The vindaloo was delicious and carried a ton of spice along with it.  The lamb was very tender and flavorful and the basmati was not overcooked as most places are.  So far this is the best Indian restaurant I\'ve tried in the city.\n\nThey now accept credit cards as well!' u"Here for a weekend visiting from SF and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place. \n\nChicken with butter tomato sauce with the cilantro naan was AMAZING. \n\nI also loved the chicken kebab with mint chutney sauce (I made sure to wipe every last bit of it) with basmati rice. \n\nYUM YUM YUM DEFINITELY RECOMMEND COMING HERE!" u"Amazing value at this 2nd floor hidden gem. \n\nThe lunch special is only $9.50 and comes with two dishes rice and naan. I'm usually tempted to order an additional side like maligatawny or samosas but honestly the portions are very large and filling without the sides!\n\nThe alo gobi (cauliflower potatoes and peas) comes in a tomato sauce and is slightly spicy. The chicken tikka marsala is fresh juicy creamy and full of that hearty goodness you are looking for. Look out the chicken vindaloo is spicy! Would recommend a variety of meat and vegetable dishes. Everything is spiced perfectly and slow cooked. \n\nService is excellent and there is ample seating. Plus they rock out to some authentic Indian tunes so you kinda feel like you're in a spa. Satisfy that Indian craving!"],0.5093,0.523,0.477,0.0
121.The View Restaurant & Lounge,[u"We decided to go out for drinks after broadway show we initially were looking for a roof top bar when we asked the concierge he recommended The View\nOnce we got there the service was a bit slow and the small plates menus was almost non existent the other option was the all you can eat bar we didn't want to eat that much luckily for us our server recommended the pomegranate margarita and that made the evening spectacular\nWe drink until they closed I'm sure it was pricey but they were delicious and didn't give me a hangover" u'God awful from beginning to the end. \nI had the absolutely WORST experience ever at this restaurant! This dinner was supposed to be my proposal dinner to my girlfriend (now fiance with no help to The View). I made my reservation two weeks in advance and clearly stated that this would be a wedding proposal and explained how I wanted it to happen (also sent a follow up message to the event email). The manager waits until the day of proposal/reservation day to notify me that they couldn\'t accommodate my request. WOW!!! Possibly the biggest moment of our lives and you wait until the day of to let me know you can\'t accommodate my WEDDING PROPOSAL! Absolutely unprofessional and inconsiderate. \nThat was part 1. \nI decide to amend my 8 oclock reservation and still go to the restaurant. We begin by waiting 20 mins for bread and water. Then we order a bottle of wine to celebrate and it took 45 mins to receive it but not before the waiter gave our bottle to the table behind us that had just sat down. The service was absolutely terrible. He didn\'t check on us ONCE during that 45 mins of waiting for the wine bottle. When I asked him why it took so long and his reply was " (with an attitude) I\'m the only one working 17 tables. Don\'t you see me running around." As I try to reply  he immediately cuts me off and says "You can just speak to a manager if you got a problem. I actually prefer you talk to a manager. Let him know this isn\'t okay". \nThe manager tried to reconcile the situation with complimentary drinks but he didn\'t show much empathy or sincereity and my fianc\xe9 was fed up with the restaurant\'s service at this point. It took 1 hour for bread water and wine. Who knows how long it would of taken to get the main course. \nI will not recommend this restaurant to any of my friends/family/colleagues ever until they undergo new management. \n\n\n- Disappointed Newly Enegaged Couple' u'Unforgettable experience above average food. Come for the revolving rooftop view of nyc. \n\nService: 5/5\nMy boyfriend made a reservation for us on a Saturday night at 6 pm - this was perfect timing since we got to see the sunset. I suggest making a reservation and asking for a window view. You enter through the Marriott hotel and take an elevator up to the 48th floor. When we got to the top we were seated immediately. The view when you first sit down is not that great but it gets better as the restaurant rotates. The food was served quickly and the waiters were quick to clean our plates. Servers were very friendly and accommodating to the customizations I requested for my meal.\n\nAmbience: 5/5\nGreat great GREAT ambience. There are huge windows so that you can see the skyline. Can\'t remember if they played music but if they did it was not overwhelming.\n\nFood: 4/5\nOkay I will be honest I am not a fan of food at really high end places and have never really had great food at any place that has more than $$ on it. HOWEVER I will say that my meal her was the best "fancy restaurant food" I\'ve had. It\'s a set three course meal. I got an octopus and watermelon appetizer. It was interesting combination and thought it tasted decent. Boyfriend got the gazpacho - tasted average. \n\nFor entree I got a lamb shank with creamy polenta and asparagus. I love lamb and I thought this was very well done. It had some sort of citrus seasoning which tasted fantastic with the meat. The portion was also huge... The polenta and asparagus were very normal.  \n\nBoyfriend got some sort of cod dish. Was all right. \n\nWe were pretty full by the time dessert came around so we shared a pavlova with a coconut and mahogany mousse thing and also a sherbet on the side. Very yummy. The sherbet was some.kind of tart grape flavor which we liked. We also got a cheese and crackers plate to go but forgot it at the hotel so we didn\'t actually get to taste it. But it looked very decadent!! \n\nOverall great experience. Very very pricey but what do you expect for a place like this. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion :)' u"Okay so first and foremost this is a REALLY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT. It's a bit of a tourist trap located at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square and our bill for two people came to $340. If you're no longer interested after hearing that you're a smarter person than I am and you should skip it.\n\nBut if you come in knowing how pricey it will be and you're totally fine with that I do recommend it for you. Cost aside our experience was quite nice. \n\nOf course the primary attractor here is the fact that the 48th-floor restaurant rotates. It rotates very slowly - about one rotation per hour and it's not like you're looking out the window and seeing straight down because there are tracks upon which the restaurant is rotating and the tracks are much wider than the restaurant. So if you look straight down you're just looking at the bottom of the tracks.\n\nThe views are pretty good - not top of the Freedom Tower good but good.\n\nThe menu was prix fixe at $90 per person. This included an appetizer main course and dessert. Cocktails were $18-19 each.\n\nFor drinks I got the View Fizz and the Cocktail d'Estate both of which were tasty but definitely did not contain $19 worth of alcohol.\n\nMy meal: crabcake aromatic duck and cheesecake. I also ordered a non-included side of lobster mac and cheese because it's my favorite and at that point realizing how much I was about to spend either way the extra $23 didn't seem like it would make much of a difference lol. \n\nEverything was tasty enough. The rolls were super stale but that was my only real complaint about the food. I didn't actually eat my cheesecake because they ended up bringing me a surprise dessert after overhearing it was my birthday weekend. Sweet gesture and I'm not quite sure what it was - some type of large chocolate cheesecake torte - but it was yummy and way too filling to leave room for the actual dessert I had ordered.\n\nWe ended up getting a window seat but if you don't it's totally pointless. Had we not we definitely would have just left.\n\nA nice place to go for a special occasion. Or a Tuesday if you're Harvey Specter." u'Beautiful restaurant gorgeous view of the city excellent food glorious staff. Restaurant circles 365 degrees to give you a view of the city from all angles. Enjoyable experience' u'The restaurant is located on the 48th  floor of the Marriott Hotel. There is a separate restaurant with a view on the 47th floor.  Both floors revolve in a complete circle in one hour.  There is a good view of the Hudson River and the Manhattan Cruise Terminal.' u"Great place to eat at.\nAmazing view(it moves in a circular motion as you dine) amazing food and amazing drink and wine choices. If you have a chance to dine at this place you definitely should. It is a good place to go to for anything from a birthday dinner to a romantic date. I had the steak and it was tasty and cooked perfectly. The crab cakes were good and I also got to taste a friend's chicken which was also good. For dessert I had the cheesecakeI am not even a fan of cheesecake but I must admit it taste very good. I definitely will be going back here to dine." u'My brother sister-in-law and I brought my mother here as a mother\'s day treat. \n\nLet me start by saying that this place definitely is beautiful but with that I\'m also going to say (as other\'s have stated) I think it\'s a tourist trap. Definitely a bit expensive at $89/person this become a pricey outing and if you add wine or drinks man it\'s and bank breaker.\n\nSo a rotating view of NY huh? It\'s beautiful definitely something to see at night. Again this restaurant is one on my "once in a life time visit" list. While the restaurant was beautiful the food wasn\'t something to brag about. \n\nI\'m one to get motion sick very very easily but the rotating view of NY was not nauseating at all. I\'m glad to see that my mom was excited but none of us were impressed by the food although I will admit that presentation was on point and beautiful. I also loved that they gave you cute napkins that were a kind of map of the area.\n\nBe aware that there are quite a few parking lots in the area but expect to pay. Word of advice go online for those parking lots and see if you can make a "reservation" this is sometimes cheaper or you mind find a coupon instead which is what I did - saved about $10 on parking which was great.\n\nSo again spectacular view but the food...don\'t expect a magnificent meal for the price.' u"For the experience and view I'd say go right now!!!!!! Not many places will beat this view and this is one of the only revolving restaurants I know of! My fianc\xe9 brought me here for a surprise birthday dinner and overall we were disappointed in the staff and food quality! The staff was pretty much rude and not attentive. My fianc\xe9 made a reservation for a table for two and when we first came in they sat us at a 5 person table it was awkward and awful so we asked them to move us which we then waited for 40 mins to get a table. No mention of my birthday from the staff until the dessert. The appetizer choices sucked they need to add other options most definitely! Entrees were good but kind of flavorless we had to add a ton of salt and pepper but the portions were decent! Very pricey here but like I said it was worth it for the view and experience! Every one should go at least once!" u'The food was so-so but the view was really amazing!\nGo at nighttime and you won`t regret!' u"First of all they never told us that there's a cover fee witch is 8$ per person. Then the waitress was pretty rude and we waited for our check like 20 min. \nNot to mention that this place is not for everyone cause it makes you sick to your stomach. \nMe and my friends felt  sick for an hour after we left." u"Overall rating\nAtmosphere/cleanliness - 5\nService - 3\nMenu options - 3\nFood - 3\nPrice - 3\nTotal - 17/5 = 3.4\n\nI went to the lounge for their buffet with chocolate fountain. There's also proper dinning in the restaurant one floor below the lounge is more for drinks. \n\nBeing a rotating restaurant in NYC nothing can really top that atmosphere. I can see the fascination for tourists a 360 view of the city all our skyscrapers. However for me livening and working in the city I have seen better I was expecting the restaurant to be a bit higher overseeing the city not with office buildings and hotels right in my face next door.\n\nFor food they have a small salad bar 3 different entrees and a chocolate fountain and cakes. They were just meh. \n\nThe place was very romantic classy and the rotating part was of course the best. It's not cheap though it was $4x for the buffet plus one drink minimum." u"I visited this establishment as part of my birthday excursion to NYC. I wanted to dine here so I could experience see all of the city from the 48th floor. It is well worth at least one visit. The building spins but it's at a very slow pace so you barely notice.\n\nThe menu was easy...$89 - 3 courses with great choices in each category.  I also had a cocktail that was made well.\n\nOur server was a gem: she had our table and a table of 12 at the same time. She never missed a beat. I was impressed. \n\nI ca t say that is a place I would visit over n over again but I am glad I went." u'The views from this restaurant are beautiful! \nLocated inside the Marriot on the 48th floor!\nThe service was great. I enjoyed the drinks and the food!\nI ordered the crab cake for appetizers then the salmon.\nThe dessert was good also!\nWe sat in here for almost 3 hours taking our time!' u"The Marriott hotel houses The View restaurant which is the only rotating restaurant in Manhattan offering exceptional views and really good and strong drinks (get ready to pay though!) It is a good place to check out after a show as it is very expansive so you don't need reservations to get a good window seat." u"My friends came in as a group of 6 tonight around 10:30 and were seated promptly! It was slightly confusing to get to the 48th floor though since you have to take an elevator to the 3rd floor and then hop on a different express elevator to the 48th floor. \n\nThe service is terrible. It really was and I don't usually say that about places. We sat down for 15 minutes and no one came over. After she finally showed up we ordered tap water for the table. The desserts were really mediocre you really go for the view." u"Honestly this is one of those places where you come to say you've experienced it. \nThe experience here was very different how many spinning restaurants can you really have dinner at ? Not many . The experience was great a little dizzy but worth it the staff was amazing . The restaurant was completely packed but somehow they managed everyone and made us feel very welcomed ." u"Despite making a reservation a week ago via American Express my wife and I are still waiting for a table. It is now 30 minutes past the reservation time. Unreal . My wife and I should have gone somewhere else to celebrate our milestone wedding anniversary. This place is out of control . So if anyone wants to celebrate something special don't waste your time coming here . Notes were placed in our reservation and that didn't mean anything when we checked in for a table. We are still waiting." u"Well really 3.75 but I'm rounding up since I can't do partial stars. Depending on where you are in the hotel to begin with you'll need to type in the floor number 48 and you may be directed down in order to take the express elevator up.\n\nWe only intended on pre dinner drinks in the lounge not the restaurant so I'm only reviewing the drinks.\n\nPlease note that if you are not a guest of the hotel you will be required to pay a $8 charge regardless if you are just there for the view or if you will be drinking and/ or dining there. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so the surcharge didn't apply to us. To be honest I don't think that the rotating view would be worth the additional charge.\n\nI had the Perfectly French I would say just ok and BF had the Channel Crossing which is basically gin and tonic. That was good and their limes were freshly sliced! For me that's key especially if you're charging premium prices.\n\nThe view was beautiful and they print the buildings that you view on your napkin so you can keep track as you rotate.  The rotating room is inside a square exterior so the view is semi obstructed unlike the Westin Bonaventure in LA where the rotating restaurant is framed in a circle as well.  Here you get corners etc aesthetically not as pleasing.  \n\nService was good. If we were staying in the hotel next time we'd probably come back." u"I don't understand how people think this is the most amazing place ever..... the view isn't great at all.  Most of the time you're looking at concrete beams that support the building.  Our server forgot about us half way through the meal and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all.  Food was blah no seasoning.  Bland.  Not that fresh.  My favorite part was definitely the dessert -- I got the cheese platter.  I don't have a problem spending $100 on dinner but this wasn't even worth $50.  Go get Italian at Emilio's or a burger at 5 Napkin.  This place is not worth it in the slightest."],-0.1695,0.0,0.828,0.172
26.Nuchas,[u"These are perfect street food - easy to walk with relatively cheap and resourcefully delicious pockets of yum!\n\nAffordable quick and delicious snacks that you really can't go wrong with. They opened a new spot in Times Square you can pick and spot and people watch or eat while walking over to catch your Broadway play.  I like that it is easy to bring around and you can eat these baked treats anywhere you go.\n\nI tried 4 different kinds of savory empanadas and one sweet - the Argentine Spicy Chicken Spicy Cheese and Short Rib. It's 3 for $9.99 which is a pretty good deal in NYC. While the Spicy Chicken was quite mild it was still delicious. The Argentine was my favorite though. The empanadas are juicy and flavorful.  The  Apple Cranberry & Nutella Empanada had just the right amount of sweetness.  I wish there was more kick to the savory flavors but overall a great snack.  They may seem small but after eating them I was stuffed. If you're in Times Square you simply have to check them out.  Four stars!" u"TL:DR overpriced and mediocre.\n\nI've seen this place a number of times usually at these food stall markets and I finally gave in. The empanadas are good but not great. And that's a problem. They're tiny and $4. Being in NYC allows you the convenience of accessing cheap and authentic food on a whim. These are not cheap and from my prior experience not authentic either.\n\nThe food \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken the argentine and the short rib.\n\nThe spicy chicken.\nIt's just meh. Not too spicy not too salty not too sweet not too anything.\nThe argentine.\nThis one was kinda nice - a lot of nicely blended flavors and spices with soft yet crisp dough. Still not worth $4 though. \nThe short rib.\nSlightly better than meh.\n\nThe service\n\nThe person behind the counter looks as though he couldn't have been bothered to do anything. It's not a big deal since he wasn't rude but it wasn't exactly pleasant to be ignored until I order.\n\nThe decor\n\nThere isn't really much - it's a stall." u"Lacked rgt at time square it's a small pop up shop witlots of space to sit and relax and have a snack break..\nThey have a lot of options of vegans too..they offer 3 for 9.99$\nThe taste was bland and not hot or warm too...its was a filling just cold and so bland hardly could taste any of its ingredients.." u"It is a food truck and you MUST try Nuchas if you are at Times Square. Amazing food and the great staff at the counter. \n\nThe place shares the common seating area at Times Square so there is no dedicated seating area but there are plenty of tables so you don't really have to worry. \n\nWe tried Portobello Empanadas (Veggie) and Apple Cranberry & Nutella Empanadas (Sweet). We liked the later one more than the former but both of them were great. I am quite sure they would be making amazing meat empanadas as well. Medialunas (Argentine sweet croissant) is another must try. \n\nThe staff was good and friendly. Took the orders and diligently delivered them without much delay. \n\nOverall it's the brilliant food that you must not miss at this place." u"These literally tasted fake. No flavor no taste at all whatsoever. I have no idea how this pace has so many stars when I literally thought I was eating soft mush. I tried 3 different flavors: argentine portobello spinach & short rib. Each more tasteless with each bite. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If you make or have had real empanadas you will think these are DISGUSTING." u"At Nuchas the menu is simple it's ALL empanadas and they are ranked from most to least popular (top to bottom) for each category of empanadas - Meat Veggie and Sweet. Since it was 3 empanadas for a $8 I decided to get my bang for the buck (It's 1 for $3). If you have a big appetite then you'll be a bit disappointed as the empanadas are pretty small. \n\nI ordered the 2 most popular meat options (Argentine and Spicy Chicken) and the most popular veggie option (Portobello). All of them were soft and had plenty of filling. For each one I got a good taste of the flavors. Surprisingly my favorite out of the 3 was the Portobello mostly because I love mushrooms mixed with spinach and cheese! It had a truffle taste to it. The other 2 were good but not anything spectacular to me.\n\nThe empanadas were all good and tasty but there was nothing here that completely blew me away. It was just average for me. Also the price was a bit higher than I would have preferred for such small empanadas. If it was $2 each I would've been satisfied with that." u'Nuchas is a tasty snack. I ordered the Argentine Short Rib and Spicy Chicken - The 3 for $8 is a deal and its filling. Nuchas is successful because it is the perfect munchy food. A few made up my lunch dining al fresco in the center of Times Square. I ate here at 2pm on 7 AUG in 2015 and for fast food these baked delights are savory and delicious. I wish Nuchas was in DC.' u"Guy was so rude I left feeling horribly humiliated. He was talking to his supervisor behing my back as if I wasn't standing right there and couldn't hear it. Not so much what he said but how he behaved." u'Totally an impulse buy bc I wasn\'t even hungry. But I saw "empanadas" and had to have one. At $4 they aren\'t exactly cheap considering they aren\'t very big. I ordered the spicy chicken and had told my cousin we could share  (before I saw the size). Thankfully she doesn\'t like onions and those had a fair amount of onions. So I got to eat it all by myself. #Score. I thought it tasted really good! And the guys in the food truck were ridiculously hilarious! We talked for a bit before we continued our tourist walk along Times Square. Try them if you see them! I would have liked to try more than one.' u'Great snack to grab when you are in the Time Sq/Theater District area. I usually grab a few for everyone when we are going for a matinee show on weekends as a pre-theater snack. Everyone has loved it so far.\nYummy!' u"Not horrible but I probably wouldn't have them again. As an Argentine they have high standards to live up to and unfortunately they didn't. I'm so glad though that I had a chance to try them while I was in New York. I had the Argentine and the Nutella Apple as a sweet one at the end. Neither were amazing. Price point wasn't bad though. I believe I got three for nine dollars. Great location though and super friendly staff." u"I had the Argentine which didn't taste that flavorful or special. It had ground beef. The crust tasted like the ones I have from the freezer." u'I was having one of my "true pescatarian" days but wanted to show my boss\'s boss a good culinary time in the dead zone of South Village. Lo and behold: Nuchas beckoned. Unrepentant meat for him vegetarian fillings for me.\n\nAnd boy did they deliver. I got all three--the Porto Spicy Cheese and Shiitake Curry--and they were just delicious. The Spicy Cheese was my favorite. If I had just one complaint it was that the Shiitake could\'ve used more seasoning. But better to be under-salted than over-salted si? Perfect weekday lunch material.' u'As "food that can be obtained quickly from a cart-like contraption in the middle of Times Square" goes this place is pretty legit. As someone who\'s not a huge veggie person I wish that that veggies in their empanadas were a little less "conspicuous."  That is to say smaller and more ground up.  But their flavors are all really tasty.  Especially liked the spicy chicken and the cheese one.  \n\nOdd as it might sound since it\'s not what they\'re known for the true standouts that would cause me to return were the green tea lemonade and the sweet croissants.  Major "yum" factor on both.  \n\nThe empanadas themselves are a little pricey.  3 bucks a pop and you definitely need multiple to make a meal.  Thankfully they have a 3/$8 deal that softens the blow a little bit.' u"I love food trucks and food stands and this whole movement. So I was excited on my short trip to NYC to try out this place since it was right near my hotel but at $4 a piece and they are not that big I really was expecting a little more...\n\nThe flavor just didn't pack all of the spices that I was hoping for .The pastry part of the empanada was also dry so you really needed a ton of sauce to make this empanada happen and at least 2-3 of them to make it into a meal. So for $12 to make that meal without a drink or anything I dunno..It should have been more exciting. \n\nI got two of them and the ground beef with onions and peppers and scallions was the best one by far so I would stick with that flavor if I were you. Really not a horrible spot but not an amazing spot either especially with how much food there is in NYC..." u"Some of the best and unique empanadas I've ever tried. Every time I come to Times Square I stop to eat here. Spicy chicken and spicy cheese are my favorite." u"I'm an empanadas freak. I've heard of this place before but never stopped by the cart until I found myself in Times Square for work yesterday. I ordered the vegan seitan option. It came imediately I thought it might take a second to warm it up or something but no. The shell tasted stake and it was more of a philo dough rather than he typical thick yummy corn dough used in real empanadas. Also the seitan tasted too much like\nMeat so that it wasn't even enjoyable because being a vegetarian I felt like i was eating something I don't even enjoy. It was not hot or even warm it was room temp and not crisp or anything. The texture sucked and should not even be called an empanada." u'I had it a curry empanada and the nutella one ehhh i dont know its anything crazy to rave about. And its 4 bucks for an empanada with not too much content I would not pay this much for a little empanada. Lucky to have got this out of the way and realize I cannot count on too much of the positive ratings.' u"In a rush for lunch? Nuchas offers hot empanadas with no wait time. They named me the bag before I could even finish paying. \n\nPortobello empanada was way too salty. Felt like I was eating condensed mushroom soup. The chewy mushroom was a little overwhelmed by spinach but the flavor was still earthy and good. The filling didn't taste overcooked which was nice. \n\nThe dessert empanada with apples and Nutella was better- it was reminiscent of McDonalds apple pies but less processed. The less delicate empanada dough doesn't really suit pastries but it was a fun combo that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet." u"Wanted to grab a quick snack and stopped here. Had the argentine empanada. Although I've has better it was overall ok. Hot and filling but more expensive than most empanadas to should ever dare to be."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
126.Ñaño Ecuadorian Kitchen,[u'When it first opened \xf1a\xf1o was tasty but service was a bit on the slower side.  As it\'s a small restaurant with maybe 5-6 tables total (or less when pushed together) there\'s really only one person running the ship in the front-of-the-house (which I believe is the owner).  As a new restaurant on 9th avenue I\'m sure it needed to find its place and that it did.  \n\nI went back to \xf1a\xf1o last week and the food drinks service the prices and well basically everything was outstanding.  As a latin restaurant serving what appears to be authentic Ecuadorian cuisine there is nothing like it around. We tried cocktails made with Ecuadorian Aguardiente aka "firewater" which is a 40% alcohol (80 proof) hard liquor made of up sugar cane. I tried the ***Cholita which is the Aguardiente with Naranjilla juice (Naranjilla is a sour fruit grown in the North of Ecuador kinda tastes like kiwi/passion fruit) triple sec amaretto and a berry puree which I loved! My friend had the ***Galapagos - also made with the Aguardiente mixed with blueberries blue cara\xe7ao and a splash of seltzer and lemon juice. \n\nNow to the food!\nFor appetizers we started with: \n***Encocado de Camaron: 3 "cups" made of green plantain filled with a shrimp and coconut stew.\n\nFor entrees we tried the: \n***Seco De Pollo: A spicy and sour chicken marinated in cilantro and the juice of the Naranjilla I mentioned earlier. Usually it is served with yellow rice and sweet plantains but I subbed for a green salad (which came with red and yellow beets). \n***Chaulafan: Pork fried rice saut\xe9ed with edamame Andean corn soy sauce scallions and cilantro. It also came with a few sweet plantains on the side.  \n\nAll in all everything was great! There were so many other options on the menu we wanted to try and I look forward to coming back again soon.' u"Came here after the movies the other night my friend knows the owner so I've heard good things the place is  small and very cute...We ordered drinks and then went on to the appetizers...We started of with the \nS\xe1nduches de Chancho (2 pork sliders: bed of cilantro and pickled) they were cute the tortillas de Verde (2 green plantain patties filled with gooey cheese)..This was sooo good yum yum and we finished off with the \n Guatita (Tripe and potato in peanut sauce) and that was delish too...Then we moved on to the Main courses i got the Fritada (lean chunks of pork Mashed yucca Green salad) it was soo yummy and my boy got the Costilla (short ribonion tomato & cilantto sauce yellow rice with plantains) his plate was insanely big i was sooo jealous next time im ordering that and less appetizers...we felt like fat heffers after that..wow.. So good...\nIf you like to eat heavy then these are the plates for you...After all only like $90 bucks for all that food for 2 people... deliciousss" u"I had heard about \xd1a\xf1o for quite some time both from friends and Yelp and was excited to finally propose it for a work lunch recently. I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant to be empty at noon on a Thursday even though we had a reservation.\n\nI ordered the chaulafan which was very well presented like a cylindrical tower of fried rice flanked by three shrimp at the base. I have had a fair few fried rices in my life and unfortunately \xd1a\xf1o's did not strike me as exceptional. Don't get me wrong it was good but I couldn't help but feel there might have been too many different proteins in the dish: calamari shrimp chicken AND pork. It seemed like bizarro surf and turf as opposed to some traditional Ecuadorian fare. The dish was saved somewhat with the edamame Andean corn and sauce of which there could definitely have been more.\n\nDespite my experience I would love to give \xd1a\xf1o a second chance if only to try some of their aguardiente cocktails which sound phenomenal." u"When you are seated at a table here you already feel like an elite. Why? Because it can only seat around 18 people at a time and it's popular so there's a wait if you don't make a Yelp reservation. So inconspicuous from the outside but popular via Yelp and word of mouth. \n\nI wasn't sure I wanted to drink that evening but the drinks at the adjacent table looked so delicious I had to get one! NoI wasn't prying the place is so small you might feel like you are dining with strangers.Thanks to the decently loud (but lets you have a conversation) good music you are not forced to eavesdrop. \n\nI got the Nina Pina ($10) with Ecuadorian aguardiente pineapple juice mango juice condensed milk - oh so very yum! I'll eat my hat if you don't like this one! My husband got the Guavardiente ($12) with Ecuadorian aguardiente guava juice apple flavored soda and a hot spice. I liked his too thanks to the spice but mine was definitely better. How I like saying that!\n\nAguardiente is a pretty strong alcohol. So stuff yourself with enough food while you savor the drinks. For appetizers highly recommend the gorgeous looking Encocado de Camaron ($9) - 3 green plantain cups stuffed with shrimp and coconut stew. The plantain cups deep-fried in coconut oil not only look cute but also do great justice to the perfectly cooked shrimp and coconut stew. Checkout the picture!\n\nFor the mains order the star dish - Chauflan ($22.95) the Ecuadorian fried rice with shrimp calamari pork chicken edamame and corn. I didn't think you could make fried rice look that pretty! Dry but flavorful. We loved it. +1 for the garnish with picked onions.\n\nService is super fast. The best Latin American restaurant in town for me until I find something better. The search is on! Bring it on NY! Oh I feel so sassy - oh it's the aguardiente talking ;)" u"I think this was my first time having Ecuadorian food and it set the bar high! It was very similar to Peruvian food ingredient wise but not quite the same.\n\nMy family had originally planned to eat at Santina but apparently they don't serve dinner as early as we were hoping so last minute we hopped on Yelp to find a quick backup and boy am I glad Santina didn't work out. Upon entry Nano is small like 3 normal sized tables and 1 two seater table. The man working there was very welcoming and accommodating. Great service!\n\nI ordered the Cazuela which is a peanut coconut stew with fish and shrimp and it was amaazing! It was a very comforting dish and I miss it very much! It came with a bed of rice which was super tasty and I don't usually eat rice. I highly recommend ordering this if you like peanut coconut and seafood! \n\nMy sister ordered the Seco de Pollo which was perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken served with sweet plantains and the same rice! The chicken was sooo good; my sister loved it too!\n\nMy parents ordered the Chaulafan which was like a fried rice - VERY flavorful!! The spices were perfect! Highly recommend this! They also ordered the Hornado which is only served for dinner Fri-Sun. It was very very tender and flavorful. It came with fried potato filled with melted cheese a small salad and inka corn. \n\nI tried looking for restaurants in northern and southern California like Nano and we have nothing like it. So sad! I will definitely miss the food here. Do yourself a favor and check out this restaurant. I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything on their menu. It all sounded delicious!" u"Ceviche sampler and steak shared between three girls. Very tasty food. We also enjoyed the extensive drinks list. I can't remember the name of the drink I had (Nano something) that was recommended by our waiter but it was really nice. The plantain chips with the ceviche we're addictive. \n\nDining room is quite small or at least it feels that way but it wasn't too loud. Waitstaff were attentive. I would go again if I had a hankering for Ecuadorian food." u"I'm not Ecuadorian or Latin but I can say I've never had a bad experience here in the 3 times I've visited in a span of three years. The first time I came here was with family three years ago. We came early around 5:30 or 6pm and the five of us enjoyed a variety of entrees. I recall everyone enjoyed their meals. The second time was about two years ago and most recently two weeks ago we enjoyed an intimate birthday dinner among three friends. \n\nEverything on the menu is delicious. Seek out something that sounds tasty in the descriptions and try it! We had the \n- Ensalada de Veteraba (beet/carrot/potato salad) $14.99 \n- Nano Sampler consisting of Seco de Chivo (braised goat in Naranjilla and cilantro) and Guatito (tripe braised in peanut sauce and potatoes) with sides of yellow rice and sweet plantains $16.99\n- Seco de Pollo spicy and sour chicken stewed in Naranjilla and cilantro also served with yellow rice and sweet plantains $15.99\n- Fritada pan-seared chunks of pork served with a tamarind sauce yucca mash and and green salad $17.99\n\nEach person was happy with their order. I loved the sampler--both goat and tripe were tender and juicy and not gamey at all. The chicken was also flavorful and serving sizes were reasonable. The one point worth mentioning is the exterior of the pork was a bit dry though I think it was because of the fry. Inside was more moist. You have to eat it together with the sauce. \n\nService was attentive but not overbearing. Be sure to make a reservation during peak hours since there are only 4-5 tables and it gets crowded!" u"My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 6 PM. Since we knew the restaurant was small we wanted to make sure we got there early so we could get seats. When we arrived at the restaurant we were the first ones there and we could choose whether we wanted to sit at the high table or the booths. \n\nThe server was very nice he seated us immediately and also gave us some good recommendations. We decided on the seco de pollo and cazuella. \n\nThe seco de pollo was alright the chicken was kinda dry and the sauce was ok. Not a big fan of their side of sweet plantains. As for the cazuela the fish and shrimp were good but there wasn't that much seafood in there . Only two small pieces of fish and a few shrimp. The sauce was also pretty good but the peanut taste was a bit too strong so it tasted like eating peanut butter. The rice for both dishes was well cooked though and a good addition to the entrees. Additionally the lettuce and picked onions was good with the cazuela. \n\nService throughout the meal was good but as soon as a couple of the tables started filling up the service was on the slower side because it was just one person taking care of all of the tables so it took a while for our check to get to the table and be picked up.\n\nAll in all it was an ok dinner not entirely sure if I will be back but was enjoyable nonetheless." u"So we have never eaten at any Ecuadorian restaurants before even though we're very familiar with the cuisine. I've been contemplating whether to come here or not since the portions seem rather small for the price. \nWe came around 6pm on a Friday night only 2 other diners were there. The entire restaurant can seat 15... \nI started with a Zona Rosa cocktail which has watermelon pulp. Not sweet which I like. Not too strong either but I have a very high alcohol tolerance even for my size. It was our first meal so we were pretty hungry. I also had a Tamarindo Lindo which was really good and I don't even like Tamarind. If you want something sweet I'd probably suggest this one since it has juice and Ecuadorian apple flavored soda. I also had a Nano Agrio which was good too. 3 drinks was enough to get me a lil.... tipsy. \nFor entrees we had the Cazuela and the Hornado (only available Fri-Sun). L has had Cazuela before in Ecuador and this was not an authentic version but still tasted good. It actually reminds me of Sango with a bit of peanut butter. Portion was decent was enough for me. Definitely more seafood then what's given in their Chaulafan which we didn't bother ordering. The roast pork entree was very good. Seasoned well not dry. The potato patties or yapingachos were delicious sadly there were only 2 of them and I only had a lil taste since L devoured everything. $7 for the appetizer portion seems a bit steep so we didn't order it. The white corn was good and even the green salad with red onions was a nice touch since I love a simple dressing that's acidic. \nPortions are a bit small especially for someone tall like L so he ordered another entree to share. $24.99 for the steak entree seems a bit pricey for the small amount of protein but it was seriously delicious. Loved the marinade. It was perfectly seasoned grilled on the BBQ... perhaps a bit overcooked for us but not dry at all. The lentils were soft but not mushy. Not a fan of sweet plaintains. \nA shot of aguardiente will definitely burn...\nService was great. The place was full and everyone seemed quite happy with their food. The clientele was very diverse which is a very good sign. I'm glad I dragged L here but now he wants to try another Ecuadorian restaurant to compare..." u"If you want to try good Ecuadorian food this is the right place. It's a bit pricy but it's very delicious!!\n\nI had the cazuela with shrimp and fish it came with salad and yellow rice. It was fantastic. I enjoyed a lot!  It's made from smashed green banana plantain. I highly recommend this plate.\n\nI've also had tried the humitas and tortillas de verde as an appetizer they are very good!! Humitas is made from corn and has cheese on it. Tortillas de verde are made by green plantain and also have cheese on it.\n\nThey have some Ecuadorian cocktails. They are very strong so be careful. One is enough. You have to try!!\n\nIf you want a different kind of Latin American food this is a must-go. You really should go and eat eat eat. \n\nBuen provecho!!" u"Ordered the arroz con pollo (chicken on rice?) dish as take out during lunch hour and the service is quite fast it was ready in about 15 minutes and they called me to let me know it's ready. What I really like is they will help keep your food warm while you are on the way there and the staff made sure to check that the food is warm and you are satisfied\n\nThe flavor of the food is amazing the moment I opened the lunchbox on my desk you can smell the fragrant rice and plantain. I especially liked the rice and they had some raisin in there too. the chicken is pretty good as well tender and tasty." u"First time trying out Ecuadorian food! My Ecuadorian friend recommended this place to me. I ended up coming here with a friend for dinner. The restaurant is rather small we had reservations in advance but the place wasn't super busy when we got there. \n\nService was good the place was cute and the food was good. I enjoyed their fish and rice dish! It was packed with flavors that blended well together! My friend also thought the food was good too!" u"We were very pleasantly surprised by our experience at Nano.   Here's what it was and what it wasn't. \n\nThis is a very small restaurant with like 5 or 6 tables.  You are served by one waiter who is very familiar with the menu.  For all we knew he might even be the chef. \n\nThe menu is fairly small but it could accommodate all of us including vegetarian and gluten-free diners.  \n\nThe food is fresh and delicious.  Lots of great new flavors and nothing was overcooked or over salted.  Delicious.  But it is largely authentic Andean food that hasn't been dumbed down too much for American eaters. \n\nThe prices are surprisingly affordable -- four of us dined for $90 (including a generous tip).  Wine is $11 a glass and they have a pretty decent beer selection.   Overall if you are looking for an intimate and exotic food experience were the emphasis is on fresh and professionally cooked folk food this place is the real deal.   If you are looking for an overstuff hamburger there are lots of other options." u'Very tasty "Comida Casera" presented in a diminutive space where like with so many Manhattan establishments the path to the restroom is generally via the kitchen.\n\nGood diversity on the menu - presenting vegetarian (not vegan) fare in addition to fish fowl and meat entrees.\n\nSuitable for groups of 6 (absolute max) or less - but 4 and 2 tops are certainly comfortable.\n\nInside/outside dining - Ecuadorian flair.  Check out the pictures for additional insight.' u"Heed my words. \xd1a\xf1o is straight fire and you need to eat here.\n\nThe Guavardiente (Ecuadorian aguardiente; guava pulp; squeeze of lemon; hot pepper seeds) was dope but the food stole the show.\n\nBetween the cevichocho (vegan ceviche w/ lupini beans); yapingachos (potato patties filled w/ cheese and topped w/ peanut sauce and pickeled onions); humita (corn and cheese cakes steamed in husk); tortilla de verde (green plantain patties filled w/ cheese); and Rebecca (yucca sweet plantains cilantro garnish beet salad and choice of pink beans or lentils) I'm not sure what was most delicious. That's okay because I'm certainly willing to go back again to find out. \n\nBonus points for awesome service." u"I made a reservation for tonight because we have to eat quickly to make a show at Radio City. I am soooo nervous. It is tiny as hell...like super tiny! But the manager is such a sweet heart. He greeted me by name. I was surprised like hell. It felt like I was home. \n\nI had pollo salteado. My chicken was tender well seasoned and plentiful. The sweet plantains were huge and so delicious. I ate and ate and ate. I'm so stuffed but it was great. My kids had the Estofado de pollo. I didn't love it but thy cleaned their plates and the portions were. It small. The only issue I had was the heaping portions of cilantro on everything yuck not a fan.\n\nI will definitely be back. My kids loved it here. They hope it grows so it can stick around. I hope it stays small so the food stays delicious and the ambiance remains awesome." u"This small restaurant is the real thing. Traditional Ecuadorian cuisine freshly made some dishes are long cooked. The chef is the host is the server and it all feels like home. \n\nThe person who left the restaurant just when I arrived couldn't stop raving about the Caldo de Bola and I was convinced.\n\nIt's a slow cooked beef stew with plantains egg olives and peanut sauce and it's delightful to look at and to eat!" u"I had been wanting to try Nano Ecuadorian Kitchen for quite some time now. My boyfriend had suggested that we come here for dinner one night since he had been before and he really enjoyed the food. We arrived at around 7 pm on a Tuesday put our names and were told it would be about an hour late and we will receive a text when our table would be ready. We got that text within a half an hour or so which is pretty surprising considering that the entire restaurant seats probably about 12 people.\n\nTo start off we ordered a couple of cocktails and an aguardiente yellow roof shot. Aguardiente is an alcoholic beverage containing between 29% and 60% ABV. Ecuadorian aguardiente is derived from sugar cane. I had never heard of it before so I wanted to taste the liquor itself (sans cocktail ingredients) to gage whether or not I would like it. It almost reminded me of a sweet vodka. I had the Guavardiente (aguardiente apple soda guava juice) and really liked it. I'm not normally a fan of cocktails because I'm always afraid they'll make it too sweet. That was not the case here. I couldn't really taste the apple soda but the guava juice and aguardiente went well together.\n\nDishes are on the pricier side but you do get a really big portion. We both ended up having leftovers. I had the Chaulaf\xe1n (shrimp calamari pork chicken veggies soy sauce fried rice). Be careful not to mix all of the soy sauce in or it might be too salty. Other than that there were a lot of great flavors and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. He got the special of the day which was a whole roasted chicken. I was expecting it to be dry as it typically is in these circumstances but the chicken was actually extremely tender.\n\nI'd deffo pay Nano another visit and perhaps try some of their other expertly-made cocktails - possible with a side of ceviche or one of their other dishes." u"Finally some good Ecua food. My fav: the llapingacho( potatoe w peanut butter sauce). Sooo good! \nThe hornado(pork) was tasty cazuela was good too and the seco de pollo....yum! \nDrinks: had the aguadiente w mora and Malibu. Was pretty and delish! \nCan't wait to come back w friends!\nThank you \xd1a\xf1o!" u"Legit! We came to NYC from San Diego suburbs to visit with cousins. Our Moms are sisters from Ecuador. We were delighted to find actual Ecuadorian Restaurants (usually our choices are Peruvian or Colombian... which just isn't the same). \n\nNanos Kitchen immediately caught our eye. It's what our moms & their brothers call each other. So check a box for sentimentality!\n\nThe menu had immediate favorites from child hood... Humitas Seco Fritada and Lomito. It also had items that we recognized but honestly shied away from... like chivo (goat) and guatita (tripe). All legitimate even though not appealing to my taste buds. \n\nI ordered the Lomito Saltado. Tender chunks of beef seasoned to perfection with fresh peppers potatoes and herbs. It was topped with fried eggs just like my grandma served it. \n\nMy cousin ordered the fritada. She says it was amazing. Tender juicy and seasoned just right. \n\nMy other cousin ordered the seco de pollo and humitas. We all dived attacked his plate because it was so good. Fresh herbs made the sauce particularly delicious. \n\nWe are in NYC for 4 days and are eager to return!"],0.4199,0.218,0.782,0.0
154.The Meatball Shop,[u'Food: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nCleanliness: 4/5\nDecor & Style: 4/5\n\nLoving the menu style of this place a little confusing but it gets you exactly what you want. Excellent tasting meatballs here (tried many types)  no doubt! Great place for drinks/beer as well. \nNice decor and setup. Multiple locations throughout the city I believe.\nThis is my 2nd time here will probably return sometime.' u"Came here for a mother daughter brunch on a Sunday morning. We were seated right away (without a reservation) but the hostess seemed confused about where to seat us for some reason. When the 3 of us were seated at a random large community table in the center I thought perhaps there were reservations for the window tables.. but they never got filled while we were there so... who knows. \n\nMaking up for the confused hostess was the wonderful waitress who was super knowledgeable and friendly. She proudly told us there was a new brunch menu -- and everyone at my table ended up ordering from it. \n\n**Oddly enough we went about a month ago and not many people have reviewed the new brunch menu and it's hard to find much about it online. I wonder if it stuck?\n\nAnyway I got the pork meatballs with biscuits and gravy my sister got something with grits and poached eggs.. and my mom got the car-ball-nara. Everyone liked their food and we each tasted all and shared a tasty fresh market salad. Worth noting: My sister noticed their coffee has a spicy kick to it which we weren't expecting.\n\nI have to admit no dish was something I dream about. But for the quick and friendly service I would go back!" u"Just okay. My cousin and I ordered the vegetarian meatballs and we were both relatively disappointed in them: the flavor was good but they were complete mush and not at all crispy. My advice to the kitchen would be to use some vital wheat gluten to help them bind better and pan fry them in a little oil to get them crispy. \nEverything else was really good but I feel like the meatballs not being good really knocks this place down a few pegs since meatballs are their main thing. \nThe salads (we had multiple different ones between the two of us) were delicious; my cousin especially loved the jicama. The service was friendly and the drinks were strong. And dessert was delicious. \nI'd give this place another try if I was with friends who wanted to go but I wouldn't come back on my own." u"I was really excited to try this place as a meatball fan and after hearing good things but my visit left something to be desired.\n\nThe restaurant had a cool vibe very clean and hip. I ordered the sloppy joe meatball (special of the day) sandwich with their spicy meat sauce and mozzerella. The meatball definitely had a flavor reminiscent of sloppy joe but the spicy meat sauce wasn't particularly spicy or meaty. I felt that the meatballs themselves didn't have a hearty flavor and the bun did not really hold up to the sauce on the sandwich.\n\nMy friend and I also split the risotto which we saw rave reviews for. It was average to me I liked the pepper and the corn but it was just okay. The portion size was fine but at $7 it's so not worth it.\n\nA nice little place but I'm still on the lookout for a better meatball." u'I was recently in Manhattan on a Friday night after a week of work in the city and was looking for a place for dinner. A friend of mine said "check out The Meatball Shop! It\'s delicious." So my decision was made. Meatballs it was!\n\nI walked in around 8pm and snagged a seat along the bar as I was flying solo. The bartender was super friendly and gave me the spiel. I ordered a Narragansett beer and then the naked classic meatballs in classic sauce over rigatoni. Pretty basic but then again I like traditional meatballs. The bartender said he\'s more of a spicy tomato fan but said I didn\'t go wrong. While waiting we chatted about Chicago (where I live) and some of the places he enjoyed visiting on a recent trip there. I appreciated the conversation because this place was packed and he had plenty going on behind the bar.\n\nI didn\'t have to wait long for the meatballs to arrive. It was a large dish of pasta and meatballs very simple but oh so tasty! The meatballs were tender and flavorful and definitely delicious. The only negative....I wanted more focaccia bread to mop up the sauce!!\n\nWhen I was done the guy sitting next to me at the bar recommended the ice cream sandwiches. I saw a few leaving the kitchen debated getting one myself but opted for a cookie instead as the meatballs and pasta were very filling. \n\nOverall my experience was great. The food was delicious even though this can be seen as a bit of a tourist trap and a chain. But that shouldn\'t factor into your decision to go or not... Will I go back? Heck yes. The service was excellent too. Highly recommend.' u"Good place if you really love meatballs. I like the concept where you really build your own dish by choosing the type of meat sauce and style. I went with the classic meatball spicy meat and just the regular 4 meatballs. I also got a side of the Brussel sprouts and apples. The meatballs were good but probably would have been better in a sandwich because it was just a bit too heavy on its own. I didn't really like the brussel sprouts side because I thought it would come with more sprouts instead of apples which made up like 70% of the sides. The food came out pretty fast though but probably would come back only if I was really really craving some meatballs." u"This place is cute and fun - you write on the menus with dry erase markers to pick the type of meatball sauce and style. Unfortunately the food was just ok and not much to write home about.\n\nI ordered the classic meatball with special sauce of the day (sloppy joes) on a brioche bun with mozzarella and a side salad. The meatballs were soft and moist but didn't really have a spectacular flavor sauce was average and I couldn't even detect a hint of butter in the bun. When it says brioche bun on the menu I expect something rich and fluffy. Side salad was a little too oily as well. My friend and I also split the corn risotto side which was only alright and kinda tasted like something you make when you're just trying to use up all the food in your fridge before it spoils." u"Four stars for the service ambience and butternut squash risotto side (so good) but I just wasn't feeling the meatballs and kitchen sink this time around. I think it's just too tomato-y for me. I'll stick to the usual meatball/pasta combo from here on out!" u'We loved this spanking new location and sat at counter to watch the meatball shop line cook wizards do there thing. This visit we discovered the excellent veggie meatballs in parmesan cream and we loved it. We also consumed a chicken meatball salad plate with quinoa beans and other salads. It was delicious and reminded us of a poke bowl. Very filling! Negatory on the wine pouring by the glass barely 4 ounces. With all their success they surely dont have to cheap out like this. Nice decor and cool "party room" in the back.' u"I've been to the original location in the LES on Stanton St. where I had a life-changing dining experience. Was it that fact that their meatballs are uber gourmet or that you're dining with the charm of the Lower East Side? At any rate The Meatball Shop is the truth in yummy meatballs. Don't miss out on this joint if you're in NY for food exploration. Everything is pretty good just don't get something without a meatball on it!\n\nAs I mentioned in recent reviews about Joe's Shanghai and Momofuku it's as if all the popular and now staple restaurants in NYC have opened locations in Times Square making it convenient for people with little time to navigate to different parts of the city. Since I was only there for a couple days on my last trip it was perfect.\n\nCheck out The Meatball Shop before/after a Broadway show because you're literally just right there." u'A bit of a mob scene at peak hours but fine for an early/late meal. Quite reasonably priced for being so filling and flavorful. I can understand why there are so many of these restaurants.\n\nSpecial Pizza Meatballs w/ Classic Tomato: This was the special apparently a returning favorite. Kinda like a regular pork and beef meatball but with pepperoni and some spices. I was a big fan it had a lot of personality.\n\nRigatoni w/ Parmesan Cream: Since I opted for my rigatoni on the side they said I could get a different sauce from my meatballs. It was kinda dry tough like they really skimped on the sauce portion. The noodles were nice and al dente though.\n\nMini Buffalo Chicken Balls: A really tasty appetizer with a very generous amount of blue cheese dressing to dunk your meatballs in. The meatballs were full of flavor and smothered in buffalo sauce. Not as firm as the main dish meatballs but that was ok.' u"Meatball Heaven!!! If you love meatballs this is the spot! The buffalo meatball is a must have as an appetizer! If you come in a group the best thing to do is share! My friends and I shared the og meatball sandwich chicken bbq meatballs original meatball with mushroom sauce mashed potatoes broccoli and their special salad. EVERyThInG was fantabulous!!! But make sure to leave room for dessert because their banana split is to die for!!! \nVery cute place with amazing meatballs that I've ever had!" u'We called about 15 minutes before arrival and only waited about 5 min for a table. Have to say the noise level is out of control  so we were happy to get a table in the back which was a bit better. Our server Mark was very helpful and got our order just the way we wanted it: 1 order chicken meatballs in tomato sauce 1 order classic in tomato sauce side of pesto rigatoni and special house salad ( butter lettuce avocado corn and radish. Everything was delicious. We also had white sangria which really hit the spot although a bit pricey at 17$ for a very small carafe. For dessert we split an ice cream sandwich ( fantastic espresso ice cream on double chocolate chip cookie) perfect ending. \nOne could eat for a very reasonable price if one stayed away from a lot of alcohol. \nI would definitely go again but maybe during off times to avoid the noise.' u"Opens late and very convenient location. I never understood the hype about the meatball shop so decided to grab a late bite with roomies at 11pm.\n\nNo wait at 11pm on a week night easy to get seated and service was quick and friendly.\n\nWhat I ordered. I ordered the naked classic meatballs with mushroom sauce. I found the sauce to be too salty and the meatball to be rather dry which was disappointing.  \n\nFor $9 I expected more tender meat and a well balanced sauce. I left the night full(if I'm paying $9 I'll finish my food] but unimpressed. \n\nTwo stars for good service and for having a clean location. Not worth the price you're paying in terms of flavor" u'with so many locations in ny we had to see what the hype was all about. we arrived on sunday afternoon and were seated at the bar. we received the menu and were able to assemble our meal.\n\nfirst you choose 1 kind of ball. then choose your sauce.\nthen you choose how you want your balls served:\n\nwe got the classic pesto / special of the day ( cordon bleu ) naked\n\nnaked balls are 4 balls served with parmesan cheese & focaccia bread (2 orders)\nadded risotto a beer  and an ice cream sandwich. \n\nthe meal including tax and tip was $45. kinda pricey for what seemed like bar appetizers.\n\n the ice cream sandwich was amazing though.' u"Just a fantastic place to get a meatball inspired meal. I was able to walk in and seat at the bar at around 7:00 pm. The bartender was very friendly with the order and attentive to all the guest at the bar. This location is right in midtown and for midtown the prices are very reasonable. My meatballs were great and the noodles were cooked nicely. I believe all the beers are $7 bucks which is a bargain in that area. You won't leave the place hungry." u"Stopped in here for dinner before an evening performance they were able to quickly seat our table of 3.\n\nThe food was excellent I had the balls of the day (insert joke here) which was chicken cordon blu with the Parmesan sauce and I had it over mashed potatoes. So delicious. \n\nBut then dessert pick any 2 cookies and your ice cream then they craft you an ice cream sandwich. Double yum. Our server who was excellent and attentive but not overbearing recommended the snickerdoodle cookie with brown sugar ice cream. It did not disappoint. \n\nCan't wait until I'm in town again so I can stop in." u'The meatball shop is an OK no-frills restaurant. \n\nWe ordered two of the "naked" version of their meatballs. They provide 4 meatballs of your choice with the sauce of your choice and a side of focaccia bread. I ordered the "special" meatballs of the day - mac and cheese - and then with their spicy marinara sauce. My boyfriend ordered pork meatballs with pesto sauce. Then we ordered a side of charred broccoli. The broccoli was the winner of the food - they saut\xe9 it with red pepper chilies so the spicy kick gives it a wonderful taste. \n\nAs far as the meatball I was disappointed that the mac and cheese meatball was hardly mac and cheese but just a regular beef-based meatball. I had only gotten a few noodles in it. I had originally thought the entire meatball was fried mac and cheese. The pork meatballs with pesto sauce was fine but 4 of them were overkill. They were slightly dry and the pesto was very average. \n\nThis shop in Hell\'s Kitchen just opened up recently so you would think their staff was on point. They had mixed up our order / given us other people\'s order 3 times while we were eating. That\'s slightly disappointing.' u'Pretty good and economical!\n\nWe started with the "special" balls of the day! They were mac n\' cheese calls with bread crumbs and cheesy sauce. My mom and I shared them as an appetizer. They were very good! They reminded me of Hamburger Helper! (Not a bad thing ha!) \n\nFor dinner I had the traditional balls with red sauce and the market veg (lemon asparagus and potatoes with feta.) The balls were good but they kind of gave me a stomach ache. The veg was good but ultimately WAY too much feta. It was literally drowning in crumbled cheese. My mom had the smashed balls sandwich and enjoyed it. My dad had the veggie balls with the mushroom gravy and the market veg. He liked it but I tried a bite and it wasn\'t really my thing... \n\nSadly this restaurant was underwhelming.' u'This is a good stop if you are in New York City. My wife and I got a variety of small meatball slider sandwiches hers were all vegetarian. Everything we had was pretty tasty she also had a side of mashed potatoes she said was good. I would recommend this location.'],0.3612,0.455,0.545,0.0
25.Pure Thai Cookhouse,[u"Love this place!! Very tight seating with a wait time of about 45 minutes maybe. BUT they have wonderful staff cute interior and most importantly... delicious food! I tried the Ratchaburi Crab Dry Noodles which was absolutely delicious. It looked very simple when I first got it... I actually felt disappointed at first because it looked bland. When I bit into it... oh boy... do not judge a book by its cover!! I also love how I didn't feel completely bloated and disgusting after the meal.\n\nI also tried their pork buns but it wasn't really my cup of tea. I've been here last year as well and tried their duck noodle soup and that was BOMB as well. I definitely recommend this place!!\n\nIt seems like they definitely have more traditional food than the typical Thai restaurant. They accept card as well!!" u"Had to wait an hour and cut it a bit close before going to our Broadway show afterwards but it was worth it.  All of the dishes had such good and complex flavors.  It's a small spot and we were rushed in and back out but the food was good.\n\nThe papaya salad and chicken wings were pretty standard but well done.  The wok roasted chili with shrimp was delicious; great heat but so much more than just spice.  The ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles were also delicious.  The dish was a little bit sweet and the preparation reminded me of Cantonese noodles with the roasted pork; it was a good fusion dish.  We also tried the Ayutthaya beef noodle soup (special of the night) which had a bit of a tart broth and lots of goods including beef balls tripe short rib beef loin and strip. We also tried another special curry of the night and the flavors there were also spot on.\n\nOverall everything was enjoyable and maybe I'll have to add this to the Seamless rotation to skip the wait." u"Pure Thai Cookhouse is a small cozy establishment hiding bold flavors! The inside is definitely cramped as my friend and I were shoved into a tight corner between another table for two and a concrete wall but don't let he cramped seating stop you from tasting their food!\n\nI ordered the ratchaburi crab dry noodles after being swayed by all the rave reviews here and I was not disappointed; the noodles were indeed delicious. It definitely looks like it would be bland but once you get a whiff of that stinky (in a good way) aroma you know you're in for treat! It was sweet sour and umami all in one with a generous serving of pork and crab to boot. The noodles had a good chewy texture as well. My quip is that my food came out rather tepid - it seemed like it had been sitting for a while before it came out but besides that everything else was spot on." u'AWESOME Thai food! Food is definitely 5 stars..My group and I went around 11:45am before they opened and waited. Meanwhile one of the friend that lived only a block away had to grab something from her place so she ended up leaving. When this place finally opened they refused to seat us even though we told them she was coming back soon. They were super strict about this rule even when we told them we knew what we were ordering. \n\nDespite this somewhat negative start everything we ordered was so good! We had papaya salad spicy beef salad ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles shrimp pad thai pork pad see ew. Papaya salad was super fresh and packed with flavors. We ordered "mild" spicy for the beef salad and it was refreshing and had a nice kick to it. The beef had good smokiness to it-definitely would order again. The dry noodles were so simple yet delicious. The egg noodles are handmade and you can definitely tell the difference. Pad Thai had strong shrimp-y flavor as they use the tiny dry shrimps in there (also used in papaya salad). Pad see ew also was one of the highlights- totally different from what we\'ve had in the past! \n\nThis place is tiny and gets filled up very fast. You may even end up sharing a table with another group but it was well worth it. Definitely will be back! :)' u'OKAY SO.. thai is my family\'s FAVORITE FOOD. We have been to countless thai restaurants... but whenever someone asks me my absolute favorite.. i ALWAYS say PURE THAI COOKHOUSE! WOW.... this is a hole in the wall authentic sometimes a long wait delicious type of place. Ive been a dozen times but highlights\n\n1. If you are a fan of THAI ICED TEA get it HERE. IT is for some reason so special with crushed ice and beer mug milky goodness. It just tastes a tad different than your typical thai spots... so if youre a fan try it here. I always end up getting a refill \n\n2. My app suggestion (my fam also loves BAO).. get the Steamed Beef Buns $9 (you get two) \n(slow braised beef brisket leeks cucumber sesame plum sauce) we always get them. they are wow. another app ("snack" on their menu) i recommend are the Roasted Baby Back Ribs* $10\nbean paste marinated pork ribs sesame seed cilantro (also DELISH if you are an asian rib lover like i am)\n\n3. THE SOUP THE SOUP THE SOUP. if you don\'t get the soup you are crazy. it is the best soup I\'ve ever had in my whole life. I have gotten it every single time... EVERY SINGLE TIME. \n\n-Sukhothai Pork Noodles Soup**\nthin rice noodles roasted pork long bean bean sprout peanut dried shrimp pork broth $13\n\nIT IS WOW!  so many flavors in that bowl!!!! \n\n\nTHINGS TO BE CONSIDERED- this place is always busy. It is popular. It is not a place to go before the theatre... unless you have 2 hours to spare with time to wait. WE always go for lunch... lunch there are less people and we go as soon as they open.. So that we get a seat! and we always do. SHOUT OUT TO FORD our favorite waiter. The service is super quick. The place is just darling. It will always be a 5 star for me. if you love thai.. COME HERE! RUN HERE!' u"If you blink you'll miss this place. Tiny entrance small dining area with tables close together but the ambiance feels authentic. At 1245 on a Friday afternoon the wait was 20 minutes before we were seated at the counter. We ordered chicken satay pad kee mao and Sukhothai Pork Noodles Soup. The satay was a tiny portion not exactly worth $8 but tasty nonetheless. The noodles in the pad kee mao were soft and not clumpy or sticky at all-- not what you're used to getting at a Thai joint-- and the flavor is on point. I went out of my comfort zone with the soup and was rewarded with an incredible combination of flavors really unique and had nice heat to it! Also got the Thai iced tea so Matthew could try -- best one I've had for sure -- not too sweet. \n\nStaff was friendly very accommodating and attentive. Def recommend!" u"After a long debate with my co-workers on where to eat we finally decided to walk to Pure Thai. The place is small but the turnover rate is amazing. The wait was around 15 minutes at 12:45 PM on a Wednesday especially for an 8 person party. \n\nAtmosphere/Ambiance: Boutique size restaurant that does really well on keeping the authenticity of Thai culture. The kitchen is right in the middle of the restaurant and it's usually only 2-3 cooks. You can even see the live action cooking!!\n\nService: extremely friendly waitresses and made sure everyone was taken care of. They were extremely attentive and made sure to check up on us. Our glasses were never empty.\n\nFood ordered:\nAppetizers:\nBeef steamed buns (4/5): serves of 2 and it comes in a cute little bun holder!! The meat was a little on the dry side.\n\nGreen Papaya with raw crab (5/5): very interesting mix of flavors!\n\nChicken Curry Puffs: (4/5) the puff was packed with meat and its a serving of 4.\n\nEntrees:\nPad kee mao (5/5): hits the spot for a dried noodle\n\nPad see ew (5/5): always a safe choice can't go wrong\n\nDuck noodle soup - hand drawn noodles (5/5): Hands down must try dish" u'Once again a testament to why this is my go-to spot for Thai in NYC.\nBrought my mom for lunch...today tried Jungle Fried Rice....omg its bomb. The chicken curry puffs are also delicious. And as usual the service is as warm as Thailand.' u'Love this place!\n\nFood tastes delicious and service is very friendly and quick. I loved my Pork Noodle Soup with HAND PULLED EGG NOODLES and DRY/with soup on the side. And the RATCHABURI Crab and pork noodles which was soulless already but has a delicious marinated flavor throughout. The Curry cream puffs were soooo good and so was the Spicy Beef Salad. The fried rice I had was also really good! \n\nHowever the only down side for me is that I asked for "spicy" and none of them were spicy at all! I\'m used to thai spicy level like at other restaurants in California but here it was even less spicy than hot cheetos- so don\'t be too shy to ask for spicy if you want to. At least they have different chili options on the table for you to add into your meal too.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the quality of the food and I definitely will be returning!' u"If you are looking for authentic Thai food in Hell's Kitchen then stop right here you've found the right place. That being said I do think the restaurant deserves a larger venue as this would avoid the line out the door and long wait times. But people do wait for a reason and the food here is something special.\n\nI took my friend out for his birthday here and there was a 45 minute wait but we were set on coming so we stuck it out. It is in Hell's Kitchen so it's easy to find a place with a good happy hour nearby (just walk down 9th). They used a service that texts you when your table is ready. We ended up sitting on bar stools in a small corner next to the kitchen which was a bit of a let down but we still very much enjoyed our experience. \n\nWe got three dishes and shared: the crab rachaburi the shrimp with Chinese broccoli and the pad kee mao. The crab rachaburi had a nice seafood flavor and came with ramen-style noodles and salty thin sliced pork. The dish is served a little cold but this does allow the flavors to stand out. The shrimp with Chinese broccoli also has a nice seafood-flavored sauce and the shrimp are perfectly cooked. Last but certainly not least the pad kee mao has the classic Thai basil flavor with flat noodles and tender pieces of chicken dispersed throughout. They have Thai chili sauce and pickled jalape\xf1o at the table which I really enjoyed adding to all the dishes.\n\nI will certainly be coming back but I will search for that sweet time when there's a lull in business and I can get a table without a long wait." u"This place would be so easy to miss without the decently sized crowd of people waiting outside! The restaurant is situated in a narrow cozy space on 9th ave. We arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night and were estimated a 45min-1hr wait which was accurate. Fair warning though - they will not seat you until your entire party is present and if you choose to be seated first any latecomers will not be permitted to join. They are very strict about this. We ended up choosing to wait for our friend to arrive and we were given the next table which opened up in about 15-20 minutes. The hostess was very straightforward about this rule and we saw other groups having to give up their table as well. \n\nThat being said once we were seated the experience was as great as the 4 star yelp rating suggests. Our table ordered the chicken curry puffs pad kee moa pad see ew and a mixed vegetable dish. The food came out very quickly which we were all appreciative of and it was fresh with big vibrant flavors. I've always been partial to noodle dishes but the flat noodles they used for the pad kee moa and pad see ew were especially delicious - perfect chewy texture and no clumps of stuck-together dough. Our table also got a large bottle of bottled water that was replaced once empty. \n\nFood was reasonably priced with noodle dishes ranging from $13-15. The appetizers are all $10+ which I thought was a little pricey considering how much smaller they are than the entrees. \n\nThe restaurant's ambiance is fast-paced and exciting with dim lighting and tables/chairs set up in every available square foot of space. Definitely an authenticity-over-luxury kind of space. The dining experience itself went quickly- as soon as we finished we felt rushed out with the check. I wouldnt pick this as a place to have any extensive conversations since you don't have time to linger after eating but it ended up being a great spot for my group of friends to catch up over a quick dinner. If I lived in the city I would be getting takeout from here on the reg!" u'Been here a couple times now and the food has been consistently good.  It is a very small place so the wait is usually 45 min or longer around dinner time. Get there before 7 to beat the  crowd and there was no wait.   The chicken curry puffs app was delicious and piping hot.  The noodle dishes are really solid here and no doubt authentic. I got Krabi seafood noodle soup which was not too too spicy hot for me. But on the menu there was a warning for novice "no return".  Lol...In the past I also had the Rachaburi pork and crab dry noodles which was so delicious. My diner companion had the Pad see ew with Beef. I had a taste and it was good as well. If you have room for dessert try the sticky rice with pumpkin custard. It was heavenly.' u"The wait for this place is really long! The place is tiny and I feel like 1/3 of their seating is the waiting area. Anyway I got the Thai iced tea and the pork soup noodle. The Thai iced tea was pretty sweet but it was really creamy; it had pretty good Thai tea flavor. The pork soup noodle had really good flavors too. The noodles were perfectly chewy and the pork was really tender. Definitely felt like the pork could have been more flavorful though. There was also a lack of soup as the noodles soaked up a lot of the liquid. Portions are also quite tiny! I had a snack before coming here so I wasn't hungry after but I know that if I didn't I would be. Prices are high; my noodles were $13 pre-tax. Service was just okay. Think this place deserves 3.5 stars overall but nothing brings it up to 4." u"Almost missed this place while walking down 9th ave but noticed the word pure on the door so we figured we had arrived. We got there around 6:25p.m and it was already pretty crowded. Luckily there were 2 seats left at the bar so we were seated pretty quickly. \n\nOnce we sat down they greeted us and poured us glasses of water and handed us menus. We were then ready to order. I ordered the pad Thai with shrimp and opted to remove the scallions and then my friend got the beef pad see ew. \n\nIt didn't take long for both to arrive probably about 10-15 mins max? Both dishes were nice and hot in curved bowls. Prices may seem high at 14$ an order but there is a big chunk in that bowl. It's good enough for two girls as both my friend and I had left overs and took them to go with us. The pad Thai was nice and chewy and there's actually a good amount of shrimps ! I believe there were at least 6 shrimps in there! The pad see ew was pretty good too. The pepper fit in perfectly and the beef was slightly saltier than I prefer so that was the only downside. \n\nBut overall good food. Great customer service. Decent prices. Great atmosphere! Thanks for a great dinner!" u"Found this place on yelp during my trip to NYC! Read so much about the hand pulled noodles that I had to come try it before I left! So happy that I did! OMG!!!\n\nI ordered: \n\nThe dry handmade noodles with pork and crab: \nBest decision I made ever in NYC! The noodles were so delicious and you can taste so much sweet and flavor that it was just perfect and not too much! Char Siu was made perfectly with a bit of fat and the crab meat provided was perfect as well. Overall a 10/10 experience with service and food quality!\n\nCan't wait to come back to NYC to eat more of their delicious food! Love NYC!!" u"Got 2 noodle dishes for pick up to share with a friend #carboloading\n\nIt was a hefty amount of food and we had tons of leftovers so order accordingly. Haha\n\nWe got the pad kee Mao with chicken because it had more veggies and the nakorn Patom duck noodles (dry option). We got the duck noddles dry because it was super hot that day but wished we had tried the broth because the duck was a little dry. The noodles and flavors were still really really good though. Pad kee Mao also didn't disappoint.\n\nThe prices here are great for the quality and amount of food you get." u"So so so good. \n\nCame here for dinner by myself and scored a seat at the bar. Otherwise the wait is long around dinner time for good reason. \n\nThe nice waitress recommended Ratchaburi Noodles and they were amazing - handmade noodles a generous amount of crab and crispy pork and so flavorful and not greasy. I also had the  steamed vegetable dumplings and they were full of peanuts spinach and tofu and were not like anything I'd ever tasted before and I loved them. \n\nEveryone was really nice. The restaurant is small and cozy. I didn't feel rushed even though the place is very busy. It looked clean. The food is crazy delicious. I cannot wait to be back with friends so I can try more menu items." u"Get the crab and pork dry noodle! The flavor is pleasantly interesting! I think it may be the cilantro that gives it that freshness! We definitely enjoyed the dish! \n\nThe vegetable dumpling was good and there is some sweetness due to the peanuts and something else which I couldn't point out. Would come back if in the area!\n\nThe pad Thai was good." u"Nice environment with Thai ambience. The decorations inside make you feel intimate. \nMy friend and I ordered a pad Thai with shrimp and a beef noodle soup. The pad Thai is sweet and a little sour suitable for children's taste. The beef noodle soup is fresh and doesn't make you feel oily at all. The accompanied spicy sauce is medium spicy good match with the noodle soup. The food is delicious but lack of the relish and spice of Thai." u"This place is dope! Went in around 5pm on a weekday and was able to snag the last table so make sure you get here early.\n\n\nShrimp & Calamari Herb Salad (4/5): Tasty! Not much seasoning but the flavor of the shrimp + calamari more than made up for it. It has a small kick but I wouldn't really consider it spicy.\n\nWok Cashew Nuts w/Shrimp (3/5): Nothing too special. Not bad but you can pass on this one.\n\nPad Thai w/Chicken (4/5): Solid! My first impressions of a Thai restaurant is typically based on their Pad Thai. This one didn't disappoint though I wish it had at least some spice to it. \n\nRatchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles (5++/5): This itself warrants the 5 stars! The crab is forgettable but the pork has nice flavor isn't dry and compliments the noodles perfectly. There's a sweetness to the dish that I can't quite describe but I've never had anything like this at a Thai restaurant before. Though thos who are expecting a balance of sweet and sour from this dish might be disappointed. \n\n\nOverall I'd come back again but maybe not for a 1+ hour wait."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
23.Xi’an Famous Foods,[u"I first learned of Xi'an Famous Foods from a friend who works close by. When we arrived the line was outside of the door and it was surprising since I thought the place offered typical meat over noodles but that was not the case.\n\nMy first try was the spicy cumin lamb noodle and I loved it! It was my first time seeing noodles that thick and it certainly challenged my chopstick skills. The spice level was just right too.\n\nThe only thing to note is the seating area is smaller at this location so if you are looking to eat right away or need a place to sit for longer you may want to consider elsewhere. Other than that the place is great!" u"When I moved to NYC 3 years ago this was one of my go to places for delicious Szechuan food. It still is but every time I see the inflation on lamb/pork burgers it's a little less happy. Something like 20% a year inflation on the prices it feels! I guess that's what happens when a hole in the wall becomes popular :). \n\nI love the oxtail noodles both lamb and stewed pork burger and the soy milk (they only have this on the weekends though). \n\nThe oxtail is incredibly tender the noodles deliciously springy and the burgers are just the amount of meat to oil to high density bread. Just unhealthy enough for you to get that hit of fat and salt (let's face it we're biologically evolved to crave that fat and salt). \n\nPlease open one in queens for when I visit my friends :)." u"I finally had a chance to try this famous place. It's a small place with an easily understandable menu. I got the spicy tingly beef to go. It didn't take long for my food to be ready.\nThe beef itself was soft and tasty. I love spicy food so this place was a right choice for me BUT I wasn't satisfied with the noodles.\n\nI saw on the food channel how the workers made the noodles.  They starch them out so the noodles end up chewy BUT I was watching the woman who made my noodles she wasn't pulling them long enough and my noodles were still pretty hard in the middle or maybe they weren't cooked long enough.\n\nIf the prices are based on the noodles I think I'd rather find somewhere else to satisfy my noodle cravings." u"After a meeting I ended up going to Xi'an Famous Foods to try out the food. I overheard that they specialize in the spicy lamb-based dishes so I ended up getting Spicy Cumin Lamb Burger and the Spicy Cumin Lamb Hand-Ripped Noodles. I have to preface that I'm the type of person to default to spicy food even if it hurts me later on (a default I don't think is going to help me survive in the long run).\n\nI have to warn the spiciness is not something I have ever experienced in my life. Not in the sense that it was a painful spiciness (like Thai food) or a more smooth spiciness (like Korean food) it was a completely different experience. The spiciness basically numbed my whole mouth a unique experience for me to have gone through. The food was definitely both delicious and evidently quite oily. It wasn't exactly my type of palette but I can see why others enjoy it. Hopefully I can try it again (this time on the non-spicy end). Definitely worth trying!" u"Excellent food. Excellent staff. Excellent overall experience. I will say that this spot is tiny af and it's not the cleanest restaurant you've ever been to. It's definitely a great hole-in-the-wall type of spot but I knew that going in. \n\nThis was my first time at Xi'an and the guy behind the register was really patient and informative about the vegetarian menu options. Opted for the tofu cold noodle dish. Even though it sounded like it'd be a heavy dish he insisted that it'd be more refreshing. And he was right!\n\nThe tofu was spongey looking but had a lovely tang and spice to it - as did the rest of the noodles and veggies in the dish. The bean sprouts and cucumber slices added a unexpected perfect crunch to the rest of the dish. \n\nFor the affordable snack in the middle of midtown Xi'an Famous Foods was the perfect midday snack! Would 100% come back. 5 stars!" u"Hands down this place is awesome. The noodles are made fresh and hand pulled. I enjoyed the pulled noodles with oxtail. The portion of the meat was huge and tender. The noodles were dekiciously fresh. You can tell the Xi'ans take the time to hone their craft and deliver great food. I arrived around noon just before the lunch rush. Within ten minutes of me arriving the entire place was packed. It's definitely a great sign when the place is packed!!! You know they are doing something right!" u"YAY I FINALLY GOT TO TRY THIS PLACE! And it was DELICIOUS. I got the N1 - Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles and it was super good. LOVED IT. \n\nThe noodles was very flavorful and they give you a lot! I don't even think we finished it and had to toss it because we were on our way to somewhere where we couldn't bring the food. It was good but def on the oily side. I think we got normal spicy and it wasn't spicy at all for me but I love spicy food though. \n\nThe place is really small though. Don't get discouraged by the long line if you see it because it does go pretty quick. There is a seating/standing area in the back to eat but it's really small and not that much space. So you're better off taking it to go and eating it elsewhere." u"I stayed at a nearby hotel and thought to myself it's just noodles how could it possibly be THAT good? And the pics are kinda sketch. \n\nBut trust me on a cold windy day in New York a bowl of hot spicy sour noodles with oxtail is exactly what you need. The thinness and chewiness of the noodles and the fragrant broth is just perfect. The inside seating is quite crowded but go for the food! Plus some veggies inside lovely!" u"Delicious and spicy (upon request) Chinese food available here. I definitely recommend the cumin lamb burger and cucumber salad. The noodles were a little too thick and long for my liking but they were chewy and tasty! \n\nThis location allows you to order at the front counter but pick up at either the front (for take out) or at the back (for eating in). All drinks are served in plastic sealed cups in the fridge. \n\nSince I was visiting the Times Square area this place was a convenient and good place to get my Asian food fix. There's also a Korean restaurant just a few doors down! \nI was not disappointed with my experience here but the stars are more for the food :p" u"BOMB! Get the cold skin noodles or the spicy and tangy beef noodles. The spicy lamb cumin noodles had a little too much cumin for my own personal tastes but I know a lot of people like them. The noodles here are so good I don't even know how to describe them - substantial yet chewy and very filling. This place is a carb lovers heaven. \n\nI recommend ordering to go and eating elsewhere as it gets very busy especially during lunch. We got lucky and snagged a seat right as our food came out. Bryant Park is close by and if the weather is right a nice place to enjoy your lunch." u"This time we tried both of the burgers pork and lamb. I was peckish and my friend was kind of hungry making it the perfect amount of food for us. \n\nThe lamb burger was no doubt better than the pork. Each bite was bursting with flavor! Not to mention it also had more meat. My friend said the pork one reminded him of Chinese carnitas because of all the fat and oil dripping from it. Also the pork to bread ratio was off - at first bite you can taste the flavors of the pork then as you keep chewing it becomes bready and bland. \nI'll definitely be coming back for more lamb!" u"Not much else to be said except how it's still good after all these years but doesn't quite have the charm it did before. Yet if I'm aching for something quick I usually hit up XFF for some great cumin lamb noodles. I'm very happy that it's spreading across NYC and that these delicious noodles are more and more available to everyone but I guess I'm being an old coot about being one of the few people who knew about it back in the day. I'm not that old am I? Don't answer that.\n\nHave just tried just about everything here and my go-to is still those cumin lamb noodles as well as the zhajiang mian (spicy pork bolognese). If you're looking for something soupy the oxtail or beef in noodle soup are pretty great too. The Pork burger is decent for a snack but given that they used to stuff this with pork back in the day and now the value has easily dipped a little I find it hard to order this nowadays.\n\nFor all the complaining I do prices have steadily risen over the years but still a decent value for a quick satisfying meal. The service can vary from location to location but this midtown location is good. The dual kitchens always helps when servicing large crowds but just in case make sure to go a little earlier to beat the lines.\n\nAgain XFF is always solid for a lunch or even a quick dinner option for just about any occasion. I do remember the lunch times where I would hit up XFF alone because none of my other friends could handle the spice (it's really not THAT spicy) but now everyone loves it which is fine with me (grumble grumble). So yeah if you're hankering for some chewy noodles with delicious braised meats XFF is the way to go." u'Small but packs a punch with their food! Menu was small but covered a pretty good assortment. Based off reviews we had to get their hand pulled noodle. Review is 3.5 and based on my order.\n\n-Pork burger: The filling was good but salty to me. I loved the bun! \n-Beef noodle soup: The noodles were amazing! Super chewy and the bowl had a good amount. The beef was super tender. However the soup was a bit oily and salty for my taste.\n-Honey rice: Sticky sweet and a favorite at my table. We liked to take a bite of the rice in between the spicy soups/dishes we had.' u'They have tons of options for everyone. The meat flavor and noodle texture were great! There was quite the line when we went and although it moved fairly quickly there is not a whole lot of seating. Not the best for a group setting but great if you want to pick up or be in and out.' u'I\'ve heard a TON of hype about Xi\'an from various food bloggers and travel websites and I\'m always down for a good bowl of noodles so naturally this was my first stop for lunch after grabbing a taxi to downtown Manhattan (it helped that this Xi\'an was literally right next door to my hotel the Club Quarters Midtown)\n\nService and restaurant is pretty no frills which I like.  You go in order your food and wait for them to call your number.  Seating inside is pretty limited so if you come at a busy time be prepared to either take your food to go or get cozy with your neighbor (since there are no tables just wall benches where you sit next to people while slurping down your noodles)\n\nI ordered the N1 (spicy cumin lamb noodles) and B2 (spicy cumin lamb burger).  The lamb noodles were good - nice chewy noodles with some great cumin flavor.  Not much meat.  Overall it was good but not sure why everyone raves about this in particular?  I feel like I\'ve had much better noodles elsewhere.  It was solid but nothing spectacular.\n\nThe lamb burger was really good and probably my favorite part of the meal.  Steaming hot crispy bun (it hurt to hold!)  Really juicy and greasy lamb meat which is always good because it\'s a scientific fact that the more unhealthy something is for you the better tasting it is.  I would definitely get this again!\n\nOVERALL: 3/5.  I\'ve been told that their original basement location in Flushing is "the best" so maybe I didn\'t get the complete Xi\'an experience?  Regardless I thought the food was pretty good but definitely overhyped and pretty expensive (albeit it IS in downtown Manhattan so maybe the high pricing is the norm here...)' u'So I\'m pretty sure I dislike cumin which makes it difficult for me to enjoy the many cumin-seasoned lamb dishes from China including Xi\'an Famous Foods\'s famous cumin lamb noodles and cumin lamb burgers.\n\nThat being said I still enjoyed them but not as much as I enjoyed my zhajiang-style pork noodles. In retrospect though I don\'t think I would\'ve gotten two noodles (N1 spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles and N9 pork "zha-jiang" hand-ripped noodles) and a burger (B2 spicy cumin lamb burger) as it was just WAY TOO MUCH FOOD for two people who had plans to eat lots more during the day. I really enjoyed the hand-pulled noodles and the sauce (despite my aversion to cumin) and my boyfriend really liked the food without my strange aversion to cumin. We were VERY grateful for the jasmine tea I ordered on the side as the food was quite spicy and very savory. \n\nDefinitely eat it fresh at the very least taking a few bites before taking it to go so that you can enjoy the fresh-pulled noodles at peak yumminess. There isn\'t much seating or standing room so keep a sharp eye for room to eat your food. Fresh noodles don\'t travel great but we still managed to enjoy cold leftovers that sat in the fridge for a while because the flavors were just that good. (The texture was definitely not as great but the sauce was still that good.) \n\nNo servers you wait to hear your order number called and bring your food to the back to try to find a spot to wolf down the food. Napkins black vinegar hot sauce soy sauce chopsticks other cutlery etc. found at the back.\n\nRecommended for a quick stop with a friend or two (don\'t try to be too popular here okay) to get some authentic northwestern Chinese food. You get a lot of food a pretty fair amount for the price so err on the side of getting less; you won\'t go hungry here. Definitely recommend grabbing a beverage too.' u"The fresh long spicy soup noodle is what we came for and it is delicious! Small little restaurant we waited about 30mins by the time we got our food there were nowhere to sit so we had to stand and eat at the table bar they had in there.  The pancake was good too. We saw this on Eater NYC and had to try it. You won't be disappointed." u"I always come here for the zha jiang mian noodles when I'm craving Asian flavors from home.  $12 gets you a medium sized bowl filled 80% with noodles and the rest with sauce. Quite steep for noodles especially for the portion which would be hard to make into two meals even for a small girl like me that stops eating when I'm not longer hungry but it is midtown. This particular dish is a little different compared to what I'm used to having which is the Taiwanese style but it's still good! It almost has a hint of korean style flavors to it. When you're done you'll be greeted unfortunately by a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThis location is pretty small with a front and back kitchen called kitchen A and B. It gets a little confusing sometimes if you don't listen carefully which kitchen to get your order from. The back room has a couple tables here and there though it's a little cramped - definitely not a place to enjoy your meal if you're 6 feet. Thankfully Bryant park and my school is just nearby and I can take it to go.\n\nBe careful about making sure that you got what you ordered! Once I asked for nonspicy only to get back to school and learn that it had chili oil. I can't handle my space well and this oil in particular was incredibly spicy for me. It was hard to finish." u"This place is very exiciting because it's not your standard chinese food! Lots of meaty dishes to try. Xi'an was reccomended form a chinese foodie friend of mine.\n\nI only had the lamb soup. It is a huge bowl of soup very dense.you can definetely eat two meals out of it.\nFatty and filling. Not for the faint of heart or for people on a diet for sure.\nLots of noodles and pasta in a pea size shape. Some mushrooms as well.\nTo me this is quintessential comfort food!" u"Mount Qu Vegetables Hand Ripped Noodles - So Szechuan. I asked for the minimal spicy and I was crying and sweating waterfalls halfway through my meal. Black vinegar is available to add for taste. It made the dish more delicious. The noodles are a delight. It's half rice cake but thin enough to be noodles. \n\nService - They literally do not care about anything. They call out numbers for pick up in the back and they could care less who's number matches who's. Oh well.\n\nWait Time - Less than 10 minutes max for lunch around 1PM. \n\nInterior - Small cramped barely any room to sit and no air conditioning. I could hear slurping all around the room."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
134.Qi,[u"The ambience feels elegant and mysterious here filled with chandeliers and images of Thai goddesses. We made reservations for a party of 10 at 7:30pm so we were quickly seated once everyone arrived. Despite how fancy the restaurant looked the prices are reasonable. If you don't know what apps to choose I recommend getting the assorted fritters which provides a tasting of several apps. Their fried calamari is great and they top it with coconut flakes. I enjoyed their pad see euw with duck and compared to other places I've tried the dish is definitely less greasy here. \n\nJust note that if you want to bring a birthday cake here they charge an extra $2.50 per person for service charge." u"I came here for lunch with a few coworkers.  It wasn't overly crowded but the servers were very particular about where we were seated.  Service was pretty slow and there was some weird hostility from the servers.  \n\nBut the lunch special was a good deal and the food came out piping hot.  Portions were fairly large.   I enjoyed the mushroom spring roll with my tofu pad thai." u'Beautiful space and ambiance but very basic food. I think I have annoyingly high standards for Thai food but it does hit the spot and at a very good price for the area.\n\nThe inside is lavishly decorated with a white and silver color palette as well as a lot of light bulbs placed randomly about the restaurant. The service is also good as they tend to cater mostly to people who are working in the area that come by during the lunch hour.\n\nA friend and I had the lunch special which comes with a free appetizer. I had the drunken noodles with chicken and a dumpling appetizer all for about $13-14 with tip. Solid choice for Thai near Times Square!' u'Very nice interior design. Food was amazing. I ordered floating market stewed beef I really like it. Skinny rice noodle slow cooked beef beef ball and I added spicy. Blown mind.' u"The overall decoration impressed my very much when I walked into this restaurant. From the outside I did not expect it would be THAT spacious and elegant inside. \n\nI went around 2pm on Saturday and the place was empty. They have Burmese tea leaf salad! But not authentic I wouldn't get it. Me and my friend ordered 2 drinks and 1 or 2 appetizers (forgot exactly) and the bill came out to be around $36. \n\nAs I was sitting and having a conversation I didn't even feel that I was chilling in Time Square Manhattan! I enjoyed this place very much when it was nice and quiet  not too crowded. As time approached to 3:30pm~ the place started to get crowded and that's the time we left.  \n\nThe food is Americanized in my opinion." u'I love thai besides my first love a good mac amd cheese lol. Ambiance was nice very modern chic look. \n\nMy hostess was very attentative service was on point.\n\nNow down to the food ordered the coconut calamari was a little on the dry side for me. \n\nYou get a good portion for an appetizer but again dry.\n\nOrdered the pad thai haven\'t had it in a while.\n\nFlavours and portion are good. No complaints there.\n\nThe lychee margarita if your not a drinker likw that or a "lightweight" will have you buzzed.\n\nOverall will be back' u"Came here pre-theater with coworkers. I had suggested Room Service but was overruled-- had total deja vu when I walked in. Turns out it's the same owners! The decor is gorgeous and sleek. Some insta-worthy chandeliers for sure.\n\nI had a pumpkin chicken curry which was good. My mind wasn't blown but it was a nice change of pace from pad thai or my usual picks. The menu is big enough to please picky eaters and those who have thoroughly explored their local Thai place's menu. Our admin who hadn't tried Thai food before stuck with fried rice and was happy my boss was able to get his standard Massaman curry and I got to try something new.\n\nNot a bad pick for the Times Square area. The atmosphere is nice and this place is easy to reserve day of even for large groups. Drink menu looks fun. Prices are fine and portions are big. We were in and out in about an hour and half. It's a good restaurant for groups but not worth going out of your way for." u"I came here for dinner with a friend.  The place looks very modernized and high end cool atmosphere.  The tables inside had enough space between them so you can talk without the other table hearing your conversation.  It doesn't really resemble the decor of most Thai restaurants that i have been to it doesn't even look like a Thai place sort of.  \n\nI had the fried rice and it didn't taste that good bland and not flavorful.  Don't know how someone can mess up fried rice.  The chinese take out fried rice is way better.  Prices are very reasonable and not pricey.  Maybe I picked the wrong dish or something.  This is probably one of the least favorite thai places i've been to in the area and i've been to many." u'I\'m a regular here but I stupidly keep forgetting to check in. This place was found by two criteria\n\n1. I NEED MORE THAI RESTAURANTS TO TRY\n2. Where can I get Thai food by Times Square? Because I want thai food and nothing else at this exact moment. \n\nThus this place magically appeared and I\'m in love. Visually the restaurant is stunning. They have lots of glass objects. So it\'s constantly "Oh my. What\'s that shiny beautiful thing?" *snaps 1000 pictures* \n\nFood is pretty standard. Lots of different options to try. I really come for the visuals. Staff is all over the place so it\'s hard to get their attention. Every person that I\'ve brought here was mesmerized by the decor. \n\nI come back whenever I\'m in Times Square. It\'s always a sight to see.' u"I dropped by today for a lunch since it's ends at 330pm but was disappointed when they told me happy hour only for Monday and Tuesday...\n\nSo I ended up ordering two lunch specials...\n\nThe $14 lunch set with two chicken wings beef noodles (mifeng) and two scoopes of green tea ice cream. Best value !!\n\nSecond order was the tilapia with basil sauce Delicious!! But no one told me it was spicy so I was drinking a ton of water....And the appetiter was steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings (3)\n\nTheir currently new and ever changing dessert item I tried today was :\nMatcha Cheese cake and mango sorbet \nInstead of using gramcrackers on the base it was this thin spongr cake like layer connected by a thin layer of white chocolate.And on top of the cake there was strawberry jam. The fresh strawberries were good with the mint leafs." u'Although you can easily pass by without noticing this restaurant on busy touristy 8th Ave. near 42nd St. once you enter it\'s like a different world. Qi probably has the most distinctive decor of any Thai restaurant in NYC and designed for the trendy Bangkokian-like crowd that seems to gather in the evenings. It\'s a great place to bring your out-of-town guests for that NYC-Wow factor. \n\nChef Pichet Ong has created a Bangkok menu to match. I\'ve eaten here for lunch and dinner at least 6 times and prefer their dinner service which is less crowded and rushed. This is the place to be adventurous trying something other than what you\'d order at your neighborhood Thai restaurant.\n\nMost of the appetizers are good and for me the standouts include the Herbal Coconut Calamari and the Spicy Mixed Mushroom Larb with 3 types of delicious mushrooms. The Larb was bursting with decadent spice flavors of kaffir lime cilantro scallions crispy rice chili mint lime lemongrass and toasted jasmine rice powder!\n\nFor a dinner entree the waitress gently steered my friend away from the Fiery Pork Red Turmeric Curry which is billed as "Perhaps the spiciest Thai dish NYC has to offer." Very phet phet! Instead he went for the Steamed Ginger Chilean Sea Bass Cast Iron Pot with a spicy chili lime garlic sauce which was delicious. \n\nMy Spicy Sukkee Haeng basically a Thai Sukiyaki was a bit disappointing only because it was not as unique as other dishes. However tasting my friend\'s Rib Eye Steak with Massaman Ginger Cream Sauce I know exactly what I\'m ordering the next time! It was so unique and flavorful.\n\nService was friendly and the dinner wait staff know their stuff. There is a full bar with fun cocktails. The restaurant is pretty big especially for a Thai place with long rows of clear Lucite tables and chairs upside-down chandeliers a huge buddha and huge Thai holograms. Even the restrooms have holograms. You know you\'re in the Men\'s room when there is a ceremonial Thai guy watching you do your business.' u"Food 3.5/5\nService 1.5/5\nAmbiance 4/5\n\nService was so awful it was not even funny. Nobody was rude but nobody was friendly at all. From start to finish... the hostess was awful and didn't even smile or said hello. The people who work there are so miserable and awful so inattentive and not professional at all. Took forever to get our order. They refilled our neighbor's water but didn't refill ours when clearly my glass was empty. No smile or anything from anyone. Geez they are clearly not happy at this place or they need some serious customer service 101.\n\nThe menu was very interesting. Price was reasonable. I'd like to come back to further explore the menu but if I have to deal with the same lackluster service again I'd probably just pass.\n\nThe Beef noodle soup was one of the recommended dishes though it didn't say soup in the description. I've had really good beef noodle soup so this was not at par.\n\nThe prawns were good. It came with 2 sauces. Didn't like the brown sauce but loved the spicy sauce. It was a bit too spicy for me. If it were just a little less spic it would've been perfect! \n\nThe pumpkin curry chicken was good. Rice was not generous but okay. Nothing  super memorable. \n\nCool looking interior. Very intriguing exterior. Very modern and a lot bigger than I had expected." u"Stopped by for drinks with a friend and took a seat at the bar. \n\nEntering this place was weird. You step into to the dining area immediately and I thought there's no hostess. But they're just tucked in to the right. \n\nDecor is cool and modern. The chandeliers can use some dusting though. \n\nMy friend and I ordered that drink with the loooooooong name. It was good! Nothing out of this world but the name was to fun to pass up. I later got the pomegranate prosecco drink. Not worth it. Don't get it. \n\nWe also got the fritter platter. It's the perfect amount of food for two if you're just wanting to nibble on something. Every little piece of fried goodness hit the spot! Was it out of this world? No. But I ain't complainin'. \n\nWould I come back for drinks again? I'm not sure. My friend said their hot sake drinks were good so maybe once the weather gets cooler I'll step inside again." u'Had dinner prior to theater. Food is excellent - had Curry and Pad Se Ew ..... \nservice was prompt and friendly \n\nBest way to describe atmosphere is ..... eclectic .....  worth the trip would return' u"Thai food right around the Times Square area. Unique decor with all white tables chairs and chandeliers. The service was fast. Not too busy on a Friday night. \n\nThere's plenty of vegetarian/vegan options-- they mark dishes that can be made vegetarian by substituting meat with vegetables tofu or mock duck! I got pad kee mao with steamed tofu (not fried which I liked). Doesn't taste like normal pad kee mao I've had before. The noodles were soggy and kinda mushed together and the sauce was super sweet and salty. My experience with pad kee mao is a more pronounced basil and spicy flavor. Maybe it's a stylistic thing. \n\nThere's a decent drink menu including cocktails wine & beer. \n\nPricing is decent for Times Square food. Would be willing to try another dish since they offer veggie options. But I wouldn't get the pad kee mao again." u"Came here for a friend's birthday. Interior decor is so beautiful and elegant - crystals dazzling everywhere even the bathroom too but there was a face there and that kind of scared me :( I've never rushed so quickly out of bathroom before haha. Staff and service was ok - attitude from waitress tsk. Majority of us ordered the same items varying from: thai iced tea pad thai pad see ew bangkok fried rice and green curry with rice. We all enjoyed what we ordered food was good! We brought in a cake and they charged us a few dollars per person that was a bummer. Overall decent experience - will possibly come back but the staff needs to work on their customer service." u"We were the first ones in when it opened which was good because it fills up fast during the lunch rush. And no wonder the food and atmosphere are great!\n\nThe d\xe9cor is so unique. All white and chic with bubble lights and chandeliers and mirrors everywhere. It was a nice change of pace from the typical NYC restaurant. Even the bathroom was uniquely decorated with a hologram of a traditional Thai woman in the mirror!\n\nThe food was cheap by New York standards with a lunch special (appetizer plus entree item) for $9.95. The food was good! I was surprised that they didn't ask me how spicy I wanted my fried rice but when I requested a little kick they were happy to oblige. The service was good and the restaurant was centrally located only about a 7 min walk from times square. Would recommend!" u"I love the decor of this restaurant; cute for a date or a girl's night out. I love the food. I always order the pineapple fried rice and the dumplings. Their passion fruit mojito is delicious. The service could be better. The servers aren't the friendliest and could be a bit more attentive. I've also ordered take out here using Seamless and they dropped the ball on the order and I had to wait an additional 25 minutes after the designated pick up time to receive my food" u"I was absolutely shocked to find delicious reasonably priced thai food next to Times Square. The interior is beautiful though the lithograph of a man staring at you inside the bathroom mirror is mildly unsettling.\n\nWe had tom yum a curry and pad thai and all of it was delicious. Not the best thai you'll ever eat but you will have no complaints." u"Went to Qi for lunch on my birthday so it will forever be special to me. First of all this restaurant is stunning. The Thai statue in the back the chandeliers on the tables and the art on the walls... give their interior designer a Nobel prize. Second it looks like such an expensive restaurant but it's so not! They have a great lunch special for $7.95 until 3:30pm daily that includes an appetizer and an entree. And they have tons of options but in order to understand a good Thai dish you gotta go for the Panang curry. Jackpot my friends. It's a huge portion and it's really fresh and tasty and had just the right amount of spice. I tried their red and green curries and they were good but I liked mine the most. The green salad that was my app was great too! Plenty of that peanut sauce! \n\nAlso I don't know why someone else wrote the seating is tight. Its tables are normally spaced out and we didn't feel cramped at all. \n\nGo here for lunch!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
69.Totto Ramen,[u"Love the food here.  The Ramen was delicious especially for a non pork person.  Often places like this only serve pork based products but not this place.  \n\nWhat's funny is that my wife is a pork lover and there was so much pork that she got porked out." u"Rating: 4.5/5.\n\nParty of 2 arrived around 630 to a line of at least 3 parties before us. Greeted by a very nice lady who told us our wait would be 30-45 min really ended up being a 15-20 min wait. Very fast  'come and go' service which makes the wait not as long as they say it will be. Don't expect to sit and catch up with friends here they're tryna get you to eat and go- which is fine with me!\n\nThe staff was extremely efficient in getting orders in and out to customers. You put your order in with the hostess prior to getting seated. It was fun sitting at the bar watching them make the ramen (my partner wasn't a fan of sitting at the bar tho bc the servers kept coming next to her to grab the food from the cooks). \n\nI got the spicy Paitan. Perfect amount of spice more like a 2/5 spice level enough to feel the burn but not enough to keep you from gulping water down after every slurp.  \n\nDefinitely recommend this spot if you're trying to get good quality ramen without the long wait time. Oh and CASH ONLY!" u"I've had a lot of subpar ramen recently across the states - so this is so refreshing w/o having to fly to Japan.\n\n1) Cash Only\n2) Small/always a line even during weekday lunch\n3) 1 order per a person\n4) U don't come here to sit and hang out after your meal is done\n5) Pork broths are much better than the Chicken based ones\n6) Do not come with a large group\n\nIf the line was more convenient I would come here more often on these rainy gloomy days." u"Got here at 10pm and there were still people waiting outside.  Fast service so the wait was not long.  Hosts and servers were great.\n\nI ordered the Extra Spicy Miso Ramen.  It came with yellow curly noodles.  It was a little too spicy for me to the enjoy the Umami of the broth.  Thank goodness they were ok with me asking them to add more broth to my ramen to dilute the spiciness.\n\nI tried friend's Chicken Paitan Ramen broth and it was so delicious!  The Pork Buns were so tender yummy and messy.  Remember to bring cash.  I forgot to bring cash.  Friend saved me from washing dishes by paying for my meal  =)" u"Awesome ramen spot in Hell's kitchen! My friend took me here as I was craving ramen and this was one of his favorite places to go. Pretty neat hole in the wall and a different type of restaurant style. When you first put your name done it is waiting time for ordering. Then when it is close to be your seated they would take your order. So when you are seated then your food would come out shortly. Service is fairly conscise and at a minimal.\nI ordered the Mega Paitan which I described it as pork overload. So many different style and preparations of pork it can be overwhelming. If you are hungry Mega Paitan is great to be filled. What makes this place great is the varity of styles of ramen as I have friends that do not eat pork. So if you are looking for a vegetarian or chicken based broth. This place is your spot." u"All the great reviews hold up. \n\nFun fact: this place is cash only! \n\nNot a lot of veggie options for the appetizers but that's okay I was there for the ramen. \n\nNot only is the food amazing but their service is fast. Right when we sat down they gave us water. Staff was fast and friendly. \n\nI got the spicy ramen veggie ($13)\nAt first I was hesitant to get the spicy ramen but I am so so glad I did. It was so flavorful. The spice was just right. I got the extra noodles because I usually finish all the noodles whenever I get ramen. Yes I know sad. \nWith extra noodles ($2.50)\nBut their ramen has a lot of noodles already! Which is great but I still ate most of the extra ramen anyways. \n\nMy boyfriend got the spicy Paitan ($12)\nHe was very happy with his ramen as well! \n\nThe ramen came out in like 5 minutes too so great since I was starving. \n\nSo basically there is a reason behind all the great reviews. Everyone shouls try this ramen spot especially if you like ramen!!" u"Totto Ramen a few blocks away from Ippudo. Ippudo was my first choice when taking my friends to a ramen shop but the wait for 8 was over 3 hours and they couldn't guarantee us service as it would be their closing time. A friend recommended Totto so we walked the few blocks over and the wait was approximately 1 hour. \n\nTotto ramen had a less crowder one right next door that serves pork broth but I was hoping to try the original with chicken broth. Most of us ordered the chicken paitan a few ordered spicy. To sum it up it was disappointing. The noodles was probably the best part -- cooked perfectly. The soup was so salty I felt dehydrated afterwards. I don't think I have ever had char sui so dry and overcooked in my ramen before. My friend stated that the chicken was also very dry. The wait was not worth it and I didn't even finish my ramen... \n\nAlso this one is cash only. The one next door accepts card. \n\nI also left a bag there and tried calling to make sure it was there before I trekked back but there was never an answer. Do not expect anyone to answer the phone." u"My friend and I were walking to a different food location when we stumbled upon Totto Ramen. There was a bunch of people waiting outside to get in so we figured it must be good. The service was really fast. They were really good about getting people in and out of the door. While you were waiting outside they already asked you to place your order. \nI got the miso paitan. It was good and left me satisfied! My favorite part was the noodles and the egg was cooked perfectly. The unfortunate part was the ball of ground pork. It tastes sour and raw. Thankfully it was easy for me to scoop out. \nOverall I truly love ramen and any place would do but this place isn't even close to my top favorite ramen places." u"One of the best ramen experiences I've had in the States. Be sure to add your name to the wait list the line gets packed out the door and the restaurant is small. \n\nI ordered the chicken paitan and the broth was superb. Never had ramen with chicken broth before so wasn't sure what to expect but it was extremely tasty and not too salty. You'll get a hefty bowl of ramen and you'll for sure leave feeling more than satisfied. Came with slices of chashu pork ajitama egg perfectly cooked firm noodles and additional toppings. \n\nYou'll come in eat and leave fairly quickly. I think I spent less than 20 mins there even though I waited for over an hour but I would say it was worth it. If I was ever in NY again I'd come back." u'Good spot to go to for a quick eat. I was by myself so I was immediately seated by the bar stools which I didnt mind at all. Those who were waiting for a table had to wait for space to free up didnt seem like it took too long. I ordered the miso with pork and had some pork buns on the side. I love that you can watch how your food is being made they were quick for that matter too. \n\nThe pork buns were delicious. The pork was cooked perfectly; it was tender and juicy so it had flavor all on its own even mixed with the bun and sauces. The ramen was super good too. I initially had it without spicy flavor but I asked for it on the side later on because I felt like something was missing. My taste buds didnt steer me wrong! The flavor was way better once the spice was added. I would def come back here again.' u"$$$$CASH ONLY$$ CASH ME ONLINE $$CASH ONLY$$$$\n\nOne of THE BEST RAMEN PLACES IN NYC. This is a super small place echos what Japanese Ramen is ALL ABOUT. For a brief background: ramen was originally for plebes in Japan that lived simple lives with noodles and some meat for dinner or lunch that could be served out of portable food stalls. Ramen was supposed to be this super cheap meal on the streets....What people have made it now is into a complex restaurant thing where you pay $16-$26 for a bowl... Seriously *Cough Cough Ippudo Mu Ramen Setayaga*... Unfortunately this place has also been raising the price of the ramen... The Chicken Paitan with chicken (CHICKEN STOCK) used to be $9 last year $10 earlier this year and now it is $11.... =(. But still cheap compared to every other ramen place. Cheap and no frills.\n\nAGAIN THE RAMEN TASTES DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS CHICKEN STOCK ( Chicken Paitan) VERSUS PORK STOCK (Tonkatsu paitan; this is generally what you see elsewhere).\n\nChicken Paitan w/pork or chicken ($11 regular $12 Spicy): wow the pieces of meat are huge and they don't skimp. While quality is slightly worse I like bigger pieces of meat. Noodles way better than Mu ramen as they seem fresh and hand made (not sure if Mus are also fresh and handmade but definitely different and better here). They even include a Nori onions in the ramen (if you don't like onions tell them and they will not add it in). Feel free to pickup bowl and drink all the soup!!!\n\nRamen bowls come out super greasy. Just a tip: Make sure you wipe clean your utensils before using. I do this normally at most restaurants as part of a habit of living in Hong Kong and Asia for a couple year.\n\nOrder for food was taken before we were seated so the wait for food wasn't that long. Which is perfect for a person like me on the move." u'One of the many delicious ramen spots in nyc. Both the appetizers and entree I ordered were tasty. The chai siu pork bun was juicy and braised very well. For the ramen I ordered I got the mega paitan which was a little of everything in my ramen bowl. Everything was tasty from the broth to the meats. A little fatty in content but nothing too much to complain about. The place has a whole in the wall feel so space is limited and you might have to wait for a table on weekends. But for me it was definitely worth it.' u"Late night after dinner bite because we wanted to squeeze in one last meal in NYC before leaving. Upon arriving we were lucky that we didn't have to wait long for a table except for those poor souls who came after us and had to wait in the rain for a table. \n\nNote: Everyone in the party has to eat/order something to be seated.\n\nTotto is a very tiny place with maybe 8 small tables. The ramen came out very quick after ordering and we quickly slurped it all! \n\nSomeone in our party wanted to be healthy so they got the chicken ramen. Flavor was okay but the meat was dry. After seeing our bowls with pork belly he quickly had buyers remorse. The extra spicy pork ramen was perfect for the dreary weather outside. I also loved how they made it extra spicy too so I didn't have to add extra spice. \n\nIt was 10:30pm and the place was still packed so I honestly don't know what time is a good time to beat the crowd. You just have to go on a whim and check it out." u"Wow so I came here last night after running 12 miles with the bf at his suggestion. Three ramen places in a week = a very good week! \n\nTotto ramen is a real hole in the wall type of shop! Like many ramen places there is a an open kitchen with a long bar attached to it and a few tables for seating. Probably enough for about 30 people at full capacity.  For two people they said the wait would be ten minutes but it was more like five. \n\nWhile I did read that the chicken was the way to go I do love pork with my ramen and decided to go with that. The pieces were HUGE!  Unfortunately the quality wasn't spectacular but I think maybe next time I should try the chicken instead. Momofuku is probably they way to go with the meat. \n\nThe best part about the meal was the noodles. They definitely tasted fresh like they were made on the premise and had the perfect amount of bite. \n\nFor the price Totto really can't be beat. Remember this is cash only" u"Best ramen i have ever had!\nI ordered the Miso Ramen with pork and pork paste. A-MAZ-ING!!!\nEverything about this dish was great!\n\nDefinitely coming back!! Can't wait to try the other ramens. \n\nJust the smell in this place is so amazing and service was great!\n\nWorth the wait!! And even if there's a line it goes by really quick!" u'I have been a long time fan of tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen This place always has a long line in front so I never bother trying it. This is my first experience with the chicken-based broth and oh my it\'s totally different from what I expect. It\'s rich thick and VERY fatty! (ie very schmalt-zy for my NY Jewish friends LOL). And I loved it! Quite the opposite of the chicken broth noodles I had in Thailand and Vietnam where the broth was very light and fragrant.  People compare this place to Ippudo and other tonkotsu style ramen places which I think has to do more with personal taste (also service dining comfort valueetc) than "who\'s better".  The broth style is too different for a fair contest.  \n\nBut Totto has won me over. I had the "mega" bowl which is bigger and is totally loaded with different variety of well cooked/smoked pork.  (see pic) I think this is awesome as I am a pork lover.  The rich chickeney broth strangely compliments the pork really well.  Also it is considered a value vs other places which tend to give you one or 2 minuscule pieces of pork which are either way too gamy or just plain blah.  The regular "house" bowl my companion had is just right if you want some portion control.  The pork appetizer was ok. I am curious to try the spicy bowl next time.\n\nA major obstacle of this place is of course the wait.  (also cash only!).  Arriving 10 mins before opening helped--we got seated almost right away.  Otherwise be prepared to wait a long time and oh and please be courteous to your fellow ramen fans enjoy your bowl then pay & leave.  Don\'t linger.' u"Wavy noodles over straight noodles. That's my rec. The line outside here is nuts but it goes quickly.\nIf you're meeting visiting friends at Totto Ramen be sure to specify which one. Twice now mine have headed here and I've had to hurriedly bike over from the east!" u"Oh boy the hype for this restaurant is unreal. From the outsider's perspective I'm kind of wondering what the hype is all about since they don't even do a traditional pork broth! They do this chicken broth which they call chicken paiten. I arrived on a Thursday evening and already found the line to be ridiculously long - 40 minutes for a table of 1 and longer for larger groups (don't even try greater than 4 I would say). The queuing system is atrocious for a modern day restaurant: WRITE your name and party size on a sheet of paper afterwhich someone will review the list and prioritize as tables open up. Except this guy also helps out with the tables and orders so it becomes hectic. I waited 20 minutes after writing my name down before asking how much longer; but he didn't even have my name on his list. Apparently he started a new sheet (my name was last on the list) and didn't transcribe over the list... so I waited another 30 minutes before I got a table for one.\n\nAnyways on to the food. If you read my previous reviews I've had a LOT of tonkotsu ramen in my life - nearly every city I visit. So my expectations for a chicken based broth were a bit low. But man let me tell ya TOTTO RAMEN kills it with their chicken paiten ramen. It came with some odd ingredients which I'll forgive - cabbage and onions in ramen? Everything else though was on point: the pork is cooked but then hand charred by blowtorch; the ramen cooked perfectly al dente with a great texture; the broth was on par with some of the most complex and flavorful broths I've tested. I would still contend that nothing beats pork broth as you can't emulate its smooth fatty goodness but this is some high level sorcery. The only other ramen comparable in my mind would have been this vegetarian ramen pop-up in Minneapolis whose chef incidentally came from NY. \n\nService was very quick and friendly. I like that they took your order when confirming your place in line. Cash only is a bit annoying but I get it those credit card transactions cut into the slim operating margins. I think investing in a better queuing system would massively improve their operations." u"This place hits the spot for sure. I ordered the pork spicy paitan but accidentally eating my friends order of the spicy chicken paitan which was still really good.\n\nThe spice was really well integrated with the ramen and added a really good kick to the noodles without being overwhelming spicy to the point where your taste buds are burnt off and you can't taste anything anymore. I'd highly recommending getting a spicy ramen even if you don't eat much spice because it's mostly for the flavor and not too bad. Kind of wished I was able to try to pork and see how tender it was but the noodles broth and veggies were enough for me to give this five stars. The only thing was that it was a bit small for me so I had to get dessert after. \n\nThere was a bit of a wait because it was a Friday night but it was definitely worth it! You walk down a few steps to get down to the restaurant below the sidewalk. The inside has mainly bar table seating and a few tables to sit small parties (2-4) but it's a pretty small restaurant so it's probably better to eat here with small parties and might not be the best place for talking." u"Best ramen noodles ever!!! Every time I visit New York this is a must! Must try the pork buns too. Promise u won't want noodles from any other place"],0.2681,0.242,0.63,0.128
172.VITAE,[u"Best business lunch! Guests are top executives not touristy (Butter or Tommy Bahama's) \n\nMust get: Tuna Crudo Scallops Brussel Sprouts. You can't go wrong with their hand made pastas. My current face is Cavatelli and Agnolotti. The Cacio Pepe is sublime.\n\nI'm a stickler for service; everyone's great! Attentive not obtrusive.\n\nHands-down had the BEST Birthday dinner here. Staff goes waaaayyyy out of their way to make it memorable.\n\nI definitely recommend reservations." u"Having seen the top tier reviews on Yelp but also seeing the top shelf prices on the menu I had long ago chalked up Vitae as being a restaurant that I could only dream of. But once we got  the company to pick up the tab for a team dinner everyone's first choice was Vitae! \n\nHaving started with warm bread rolls sweet and coated in what we later discovered was duck fat the meal continued to get better from there. Throughout the entire meal service was impeccable with waiters coming around to refill wine glasses and make sure that there were no issues. For an entree I picked the duck breast which was served with brussel sprouts and bacon (a winning combo no matter how you slice it). The duck served on the bone was absolutely fall apart tender and elicited a well contented guttural primal moan for the deliciousness of the meat.\n\nThere is no doubt that the prices here are astronomical and make you question what parts of the meal are going to be served on gold plates however it is a well deserved treat." u'After reading various reviews on yelp raving about Vitae\'s excellent service especially for special occasions I decided to make a reservation for our 1st wedding anniversary. I used Open Table for an easy reservation process and added a message to let them know what we would be celebrating that day.\n\nFrom beginning to end the service at Vitae was IMPECCABLE. As soon as they brought us to our seats the hostess handed us personalized menus that said "Happy Wedding Anniversary" (although it was addressed to Mr. & Mrs. MY MAIDEN LAST NAME due to my unchanged Open Table account name... sorry hubby). The manager then personally poured us complimentary glasses of champagne while we perused the menu. We opted for the Chef\'s tasting menu of four courses ($75) and our waiter made sure to ask if we preferred any specific meal items (I specified a scallop dish).\n\nThe meal itself was nothing mind-blowing but delicious enough and they made sure to include a scallop dish for me. I liked how they provided my husband with different dishes than mine other than the appetizer so that we were able to try more dishes.\n\nAt the end they made sure to personalize our dessert with another "Happy Anniversary" message on the plate. The cherry on top was our goodie bags filled with DELICIOUS cookies with personalized stickers (they were printed with VITAE *heart* our couple name) to take home with us.\n\nThank you Vitae for making this wonderful occasion so much more special. We will never forget it!' u'Vitae is your typical sleek 5th Ave restaurant. It appears as modern swanky and upscale all at the same time. The decor is simplistic but has enough to keep you interested and sets the right mood for a meal.  \n\nOur waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made some incrediblely delicious recommendations. For the starter I went with the beef buns which is shareable for 2 people. I decided on the chicken for the main. The beef buns were ABSOLUTELY delicious. This is by far my new favorite bun in the city. The bun is stuffed with a ton of beef but also a lot of different veggies/seasonings that give it an extra punch. It literally looks like summer in a bun and taste just as amazing. The portion of 3 pieces is also relatively large I was pretty satisfied after having 2 pieces.\n\nThe chicken is also to die for. From the outside it looks very basic chicken over some veggies. However the moment I had a bite I knew I was in love. The chicken was perfectly cooked leaving it super juicy on the inside and the skin crunchy on the outside. The veggies that came with it was okay nothing to special worth talking about. The chicken completely overpowered it and won the day.\n\nSince this is a 5th Ave restaurant expect the prices to be pretty up there. Apps run anywhere from $10-$15 a dish and mains can go up to $40 per dish.\n\nOverall great place for lunch. It can work both as a place you take clients or a date night activity. Great service and delicious food will definitely have me coming back.\n\nPro tip: Make sure you have a reservation it gets really busy.' u'Loved the decor. We only had 1 app the hamachi and one entree the seafood crepe. Both were delicious. The drinks were also really good. We sat at the bar the bartenders was attentive but the side we ordered came out after we had finished the food which was disappointing. They were good but still...' u'Just had dinner to celebrate a successful dissertation defense. Service was incredible and the meal was fantastic. Great staff and kitchen.' u'Meh. \nThe prices are up there with higher end NYC restaurants - around $60/person - but food is okay. I went there for a business dinner with 4 other people. \n\nWe had a few appetizers: octopus tuna pork tacos king crab. The portions were very small. Almost ridiculously small especially for the price. Tasted good though. \n\nFor the main course some of us had the halibut and others scallops. Both dishes were good. \n\nFor wine we had a Pasos Robles Cabernet which was excellent. The drink selection was wide but expensive. \n\nMany reviews here mentioned the service. I was surprised to find the service totally inattentive. Twice we had to get up and ask the waiter to come over. \n\nThe restaurant was busy but conversation was audible. Nice ambience.' u"My wife made a reservation for my birthday. The dining experience was elevated with a 10 out of 5 service. We decided to go with the 4-course meal for $75 and were filled towards the end. Each course was presented and explained well  and a new set of utensils were brought out to fit with the course ahead. \n\nAmbiance is beautiful as other reviewers would say but I was pleasantly intrigued by the wall of apples which offers an aromatic scent as you enter and leave the restaurant.  Kudos for the out of the box yet simple experience. \n\nMy dessert came with a candle and I'm glad it wasn't accompanied with a crew of servers that would sing happy birthday instead I was given a bag of housemade cookies and a personalized birthday menu!\n\nSuperb dining experience; thank you Vitae!" u"Their risotto and cacio e Pepe (a lot of pepper) is top notch! Must get them. The pink drink is also very different and you don't really taste any alcohol (maybe that's a bad thing). However the king crab is less satisfactory. Crab itself is really fresh yet the sauce is so sour that I can barely finish it. Aglonotti is meh. The complimentary dessert (something like almond macaron?) is fantastic." u'I cannot thank enough to Vitae. I was arranging a big birthday dinner for my best friend and 12of us all evvvveryone loved it. Even for the big group they did not charge or ask for prie fix menu. Let us enjoy the regular menu. \nAnd simple free appetizer and the best cheesecake piece with a candle for my friend. At the end they gave us all a cookie which i am saving for tomorrow. Their service was just so perfect and kind. They were happy to get us all separate bills. Just want to give them big big thank you and will definitely visit again.' u'A great restaurant I would definitely recommend. I went for lunch with my husband and friend. I especiAlly enjoyed the grilled peaches with the turmeric sauce. I could definitely taste the turmeric sauce and it went really well with the peaches and the greens. The salmon one of the main dishes was cooked to perfection with bits of crunchy vegetables although the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. My main dish was the seafood crepe which had a generous amount of crab and other kinds of shredded seafood in the crepe. Kale brussel sprouts and broccoli rabe sides were also excellent and the portion was generous. The atmosphere is upscale/business and I would recommend going for dinner.' u"Good food but nothing to write home about...except our exceptionally hot waiter of course.\nBread for the table? They come out with four pieces of Kings Hawaiian Bread on a hot plate (of some sort). Definitely the highlight of dinner because who doesn't love Kings Hawaiian Bread? I believe I had the Beef Tenderloin which was very filling!\nNice choice of wine. Well-lit bar great selections. The service was great (nothing worse than having to constantly look for your waiter). I wouldn't be against coming back but it wouldn't be on the top of my list." u'Have you ever been to a timeshare presentation? Well it is to be avoided at all costs.\n\nMy wife "won" some plane tickets and the catch was that we had to sit through a two-hour sales pitch about some awful scam. I warned her that this was not a victory in any way but after it was clear she wasn\'t giving it up I insisted we at least go to Vitae for dinner afterward (since it was nearby) to salvage what was sure to be an awful evening. Please believe me when I tell you that dinner at Vitae is the only good thing that has ever come out of a timeshare presentation. \n\nA Short List Of Things That Are Great After Timeshare Presentations:\n\n1. Alcohol. I got a Vesper because liquor mixed with more liquor was necessary.\n2. Vitae\'s beet-heavy steak tartare.\n3. Vitae\'s light and balanced hamachi crudo.\n4. Vitae\'s hearty pulled pork tacos.\n5. Vitae\'s impeccable service. Not only was everyone swift and accommodating in all things but they also shower you with gifts from the kitchen (and you know I love the lagniappe). We started with an amuse bouche of a nice crisp we were given a pastry and a delightfully palate cleansing drink in a tiny glass bottle with our check and then we were literally chased down the street with complimentary cookies...after we had already been given complimentary cookies by two other staff members.\n\nI must admit that I was a bit disappointed in the cacio e pepe. Although the red pepper-infusion gave the pasta a gorgeous color the dish was lacking (especially at this price point). I realize the beauty of cacio e pepe is in its simplicity but the flavor wasn\'t there and $28 is too much to pay for bland noodles. If they hadn\'t been out of the chestnut agnolotti it might\'ve been a different story but we probably should\'ve rolled with the summer risotto. \n\nAh well there\'s always next time.' u'The second I saw the apple wall at the entrance I knew instantaneously that the chef/owner Edwin Bellamco must have worked at Bouley during some part of his life. I was correct. Have horned his skills at Gramercy Tavern and later the French Laundry Edwin must have possessed some unique cooking techniques.\n\nI cannot wait but to bring my co-worker from Hong Kong here and we opted for the tasting menu. Though claimed as four courses we were more than stuffed even after the pasta part. Of course my favorite out of all dishes was the Long Island duck the sour cranberry sauce was perfectly marinated inside the duck meat that balanced out the savory; not to mention the grilled brussel sprouts. Another highlight of the night was the palate cleanser - made from ginger juice yet not at all overwhelming kind of like drinking soda.\n\nHmm how should I summarize my meal? The whole tasting experience was fine with no doubt; nevertheless I felt like this place was a bit lack of characteristic. Sure I have tried many decent courses yet how to make each single one of them stand out remain a challenge.' u'Very nice experience \nExcellent service\nWas a birthday and they helped make it special \nThe atmosphere of the Place is very nice and is great for dates.\nThe lamb loin and fillet mignon are great' u"This restaurant surprised me I was expecting overpriced mediocre food. I choose this place very last minute and still got a reservation on Saturday night. The great Yelp reviews and scallop dish pulled me in. Overall great service decor and food. \n\nDishes we tried :\nHouse bread - dense and soft couldn't really taste the duck fat.\nCroquettes - wasn't too impressed. Texture of shredded meat with foie gras flavor. The bed of pickled beet and Green onion over powered the croquettes.\nUltimate udon - liked the texture of the noodles. Meat tasted amazing soft and flavorful pork. The broth was a tad underwhelming with a strong shiitake mushroom flavor. \nScallops - loved this dish. The curry isn't over whelming so the flavor of the scallops still shine. The scallops were seared perfectly and the soft texture and portion size is worth the high price tag. The only downside of my dish was that one scallop was over salted. \nDonuts - nothing spectacular but the bread was very soft. The cleanest tasting donut I've ever had. \n\nOverall I think the food is slightly overpriced but you won't be disappointed. The only thing that irked me was paying $14 for a glass of wine that costs $22 for the entire bottle." u"Food: 5/5\nService: 4/5\nAmbiance: 5/5 \nValue: 4/5\n\nCame here with a group of four and was a fan of every single dish we had! Started off with a bottle of red wine then opted to share 5 appetizers and 2 mains amongst the four of us. We had the burrata steak tartare tuna and hamachi crudo foie gras and crispy pork belly. All of them were absolutely DELICIOUS with the tuna and hamachi crudo and the crispy pork belly as the stars! \n\nAs a main I shared the udon with my friend which I have to admit was the most underwhelming part of the meal. While it was good I felt that i have had better udon at other places and frankly you shouldn't really be getting udon at a new American restaurant anyways although I commend the effort in making it interesting! Last we had some cheesecake which was good but not outstanding.\n\nDefinitely a pricier meal but the food was delicious!" u"I can't imagine not being here drinking wine right now. The food was so good I'm not even sure this is real. The wine is expensive but perfection. If the owners knew what kind of wine I usually drink I'm quite certain they'd have tossed me out by now. 5 stars A+ 100! Finally as my Dad ALWAYS says the only thing better than the food was the service." u'Warm bread rolls are delicious!\n\nAppetizers:\n\n- beef buns: good taste like brisket\n- pork tacos: really good\n- burrata cheese- the cheese was amazing but burrata is burrata. Crostini and pesto were good.\n\nMain course:\n-I had the Cacio e Pepe. Let me say that my Cacio standards are extremely high as I just came back from a trip to Rome and I had this dish almost daily there. While this Cacio e Pepe had a bit of a different taste to it with the red pepper fettuccine it was Incredible and I am still thinking about the deliciousness of those noodles. This dish is something SPECIAL. Pasta noodles butter egg pepper cheese = you cannot go wrong!\n\n-My friend had the salmon and I had a bite of hers. I thought it was average at best.\n\n- The chocolate chip cookie at the end was a nice touch!\n\nI recommend this place and will definitely come back even if just for the Cacio!' u'Had my parents anniversary dinner here on a Saturday night. I felt so dumb because I waited until day of to make a reservation and found this spot which was able to take our reservation!\n\nFirst off drinks are so good!! The Pink Drink was the most refreshing cocktail I have ever had.  All of the drinks I tried went down so smoothly and were absolutely awesome. \n\nWe had like 6 appetizers with the rolls (which tasted like hawaiian rolls and were of course amazing) the crudo (tasted so fresh) steak tartare (again tasted so fresh and the parmesean chip to pair it with was perfect) the veal meatballs (really good) and the beet salad (which was also refreshing! and a good light starter). \n\nThe complimentary chips were actually really good but honestly a little humorous at the fact that everyone in your party gets one potato chip for free. Still very good though. \n\nEntrees were all really good I had the halibut which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. \n\nEveryone also had a mini palet cleanser which was a sparkling raspberry drink. \n\nOverall REALLY amazing meal and would come back again and again and again.'],0.7028,0.287,0.713,0.0
85.Blue Dog Kitchen Bar,[u'Overall adorable brunch spot with old timey ambiance and fantastic crunchy french toast! \n\nFood: Ordered the traditional eggs benedict and "crunchy french toast." The star of the show was the crunchy french toast. Think two thick slices of bread covered with delightful crunchy topping on the crust and gooey doughy center. Strawberry raspberry and blueberries on top with syrup on the side. Traditional eggs benedict is over ham; tasted very good but nothing out of the ordinary. Lightly dressed salad and seasoned potatoes on the side. \nService: friendly warm professional. \nSpace: very cute with old-timey touches including a projector displaying Charlie Chaplin reels on the wall. Bar across one wall. Seating is definitely close quarters due to the small space of the restaurant but that could be said of lots of NYC restaurants. Bathroom large and clean. \nWait-time: came on Thursday late morning - no wait. \nPrice: pretty typical brunch prices for NYC but portions were big/satisfying.' u"When I first moved to New York this place was the go to for coffee at 2pm where I worked. It was way better than Starbucks and it was pre-bibble and sip. Nonetheless the breakfast options were pretty great for Friday morning breakfast celebrating for the end of the workweek. I've heard good things about brunch but seeing as how I worked there in the area all week I gave it a break for the weekends. \n\nThis week I headed back there to visit for my first dinner. It was loud and the room was packed. We sat at the communal table in the middle and it was a bit hard to hear everyone in the group but it worked out. The food was great. The Brussels sprouts were crisp and well seasoned the mac and cheese balls had great texture and marinara/cheese sauce and the duck fat fries with harissa aoli were perfectly paired. My compatriots ordered duck fat beer and a cocktail with peppercorn in it (he said it tasted interesting and odd but still good). \n\nThe waiter was super friendly and offered to split our bill according to the drinks we had as it was quiet at 9pm and he saw we were trying to eyeball the splits. They have some cool restaurant software. Definitely recommend in the area for more intimate dinners though as it's a small and when packed noisy space." u"If I could give this disgraceful place a double zero star I would. I'm not going to mince words. It sucks!!!!!!! \n\nThey almost ruined our entire night. We made a 6PM reservation prior to an 8PM show at Circle in the Square. \n\nWhen we got there it was so mobbed that the hostess could not even seat us. The room is tiny and she had to take us out into the cold and through a back door to seat us at a stupidly tiny table against a wall. One chair didn't even have a back on it and we had to ask the woman at a nearby table to take her pile of coats off the back of the other chair. \n\nThey plopped menus down and disappeared. \n\nA waiter never arrived. We sat and sat and sat some more. \n\nThe place was pandemonium- sardines in a can. Waters running all over the place except to our table.\n\n\nAnd one count em ONE bartender. \n\nFinally the hostess seeing that we were still sitting there came and took our drink order. \n\nAfter that my date had to go to the restroom and had to walk back out the back door into the cold and through the front door to get to the one bathroom  in the entire place and it was as big as half the restaurant. \n\nI would have assumed the drinks would have arrived by the time he returned but no such luck. \n\nFinally a waiter appeared and asked if we would like to order drinks.\n\nWe told him that we ordered drinks 15 minutes ago to which he replied that they would be right out so anyway we ordered food and he again stressed that the drinks would be right out.\n\nThen I went to the bathroom. I assumed drinks would be on the table when I returned. Silly me. It had only been a half hour since we ordered them.\n\nWe flagged the waiter down - hard job - and asked where the drinks were.\n\nHe got an attitude and said that there were people ahead of us and I said we had been waiting 30 minutes. He then said the bartender had a lot of coffees to make first and if we if we wanted to cancel our order we could.\n\nWHAT??????\n\nAre you freaking kidding me?????\n\n\nWe sat there for another 10 minutes and the bartender was still playing with coffee drinks. No chance our drinks or food would ever arrive.\n\nSo we had no choice but to leave. \n\nBlue Dog turned out to be a real bow wow.\n\nLuckily we were able to salvage the night by getting a last minute table at Rice and Beans a lovely Brazilian bistro just down the street. We had already ordered and drank our second round of caipirinhas in the time that we had sat empty handed at Blue Dog. \n\nNEVER AGAIN." u"The rustic potato fries are the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the seasoning is flavorful. Not too spicy not too bland. The avocado eggs benedict was simple and filling nothing too out of the ordinary but they didn't mess it up. \n\nTry the Pumpkin stuffed French Toast for sure. It gives a very Fall feeling and the flavors of the toast and the cream cheese inside compliment each other. The toast is also not too sweet so goes well with syrup. \n\nThe 5 stars is definitely for the service. The waiter was really responsive and even before he was asked he brought the check with separate totals for each of us based on what we got. That was really appreciated as we didn't have to worry about how much each of us owed etc and we were able to pay for what we got easily. Not many restaurants do that!" u"The interior of this place is amazing. It's pretty spacious with a nice ambiance. \nI got the crispy pollo loco ($18). It wasn't too bad! I was nervous that my chicken would be too dry but that wasn't the case at all. The sauce that comes with it was really what sold the burger. \nI was only a little annoyed because on the drink menu there were about seven different beers listed but only three were available. It was also only about 3pm. Other that than service was fast and wonderful." u"Neighborhood brunch joints don't get much better than Blue Dog. Living in Hell's Kitchen it's only a couple minutes walk so I'm basically here every other Sunday. Some days the line can get really long - up to about 30-40 mins wait. Most Sundays however we get seated pretty quickly.\n\nThe grilled avocado benedict is my staple but I would also recommend their omelets and pancakes. They're very creative with their drinks and a lot of times let you try a new drink on the house. I absolutely LOVE their raspberry white mocha. If you're just after regular coffee however stick with the Blue Dog Brew and you'll be a happy camper.\n\nThe place is small and intimate but try getting a seat in front of the projector screen and you'll be treated to a Chaplin classic. I've also sat at the end of the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the artsy decor with my eggs and coffee. Will keep coming back so long as I stay in the neighborhood!" u"Popped in here with a few friends for a causal Sunday Brunch. There was a bit of a wait for a table but not as bad as we expected. They have an extensive menu of both drinks and food. We all went alcohol free and ordered coffees instead. I went with the Blue Dog Brew which is a delicious mocha/chai/espresso concoction. For food I went with the Grilled Avocado Benedict. I was rather disappointed as I'm a fan of runny eggs with my Benedict and these were overcooked. The salad and potatoes were also underwhelming.  For $17 I was expecting better quality. \n\nAmbience is quaint but cramped. There is a large communal table in the middle which takes up the entire restaurant and makes maneuvering a challenge. We felt pretty on top of everyone around us throughout the meal. Service was good. Our waiter and other staff were friendly and attentive. We also didn't wait long to receive our drinks or our food. \n\nOverall I'm glad i came in. I was expecting better but I'd like to give it another try and see how some of their other Brunch options taste!" u"We were in NY for wicked and we had two hours to kill so we looked up spots for a little brunch.   One look at the menu and we were hooked. \nSo we stepped on over and the host told us it was a 20 minute wait. Which is awesome for a Saturday. Both philly and DC you'd  BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ONE UNDER 35. However we barely waited 10! All the service staff was stellar! So pleasant and attentive!\nI had the chicken and waffles and let me tell you.... that was the best damn chicken and waffles I've ever had. I didn't even try any of my fianc\xe9es avocado because I didn't want to waste any space on anything that was chicken or waffle. \nI also got a Charlie Brown. That was great too but after all that food I was way too full! \nPs. The mugs were really cute!" u'A gem in this neighborhood. Their menu has everything from fresh/healthy to indulgent. I loved the veggie sandwich (the side salad could have used more dressing because it was just a pile of greens). Other people at my table got chicken and waffles and avocado benedict. Everything was presented really beautifully! \n\nI will say the coffees and teas are super overpriced though.' u"Blue Dog came up in my searches for a Saturday morning brunch. My party and I arrived at the bustling little place with empty stomachs. I was a little confused by the seating arrangements of the place. There are traditional tables but we were seated at the large dining room style table in the center of the room. Directly to my left was a stranger. His beard was pretty tight.\n\nServers bumped around the tight walkways and took orders delivered drinks and answered questions. I started to settle in to the atypical seating arrangement. Sitting close to strangers allowed us to get a closer look at the potential food items we could order. We struggled with the menu simply because there were so many appealing sounding dishes. Eventually I settled on a ham egg and cheese bagel sandwich (a true Jersey boy) and my partner got herself the spinach rendition of the eggs Benedict. As we waited for our food we were greeted by two free shots of smoothie. This was another pleasant surprise: who doesn't like free stuff? Honestly the smoothie was a little underwhelming and too chunky but I was still happy that we got the free shots.\n\nThe main course was delicious. A true New York bagel with quality fluffy eggs. The ham was  quality and the cheese was perfectly proportioned. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the salad was dressed to my satisfaction. The spinach eggs Benedict were not bad either.\n\nBlue Dog is a great place. I don't have that much brunch experience in Hell's Kitchen but it was certainly one of my favorite brunch experiences!" u'Small casual cafe serving breakfast items sandwiches salads with more substantial dinner entrees.\n \nThey have packed as many seats as possible into this space which makes it difficult to navigate around at busy times. There is one long center table that is shared by guests. The private tables along the sides are small and neighbors are uncomfortably close. There is also a little bar that seats about five.\n \nWhile eating the place got super crowded.  The staff was as attentive as possible but they did seem overwhelmed. A server went around samples of some of their juice shots... which was a very nice way to offset the amount of time waiting for our order to be served. \n \nFood choices were very interesting and it was hard to decide but we ordered the Croque Madame (honey cured ham egg cheese on sourdough) and the Sunrise Sandwich (egg cheese plus sausage on toast).  Everything seems cooked to order with fresh ingredients and we were pleased with our choices.  For drinks we had coffee and a choice from their juice menu (The Immunizer).  Coffee was excellent and we really enjoyed The Immunizer juice because it wasn\'t too sweet nor too "vegetably" tasting.' u'I\'m not sure why this place has the great reviews that it does.  My husband and I went here for brunch one morning and were thoroughly unimpressed.  We arrived around 10am.  The restaurant is extremely small.  There are some small booths in the back a long family style table in the center and tall cocktail tables in the front.  We were seated at the large family style table in the center.  There was a group  at each end of the long table.  We were more in the middle towards the door. It was a terrible place to sit.  I kept having to squeeze closer and closer to the table to let people by.  At least 5 or 6 people bumped my chair while we were there and it was beyond frustrating.\n We were given menus but sat for nearly 15 minutes before even being greeted.  So we decided to order straight away.  I order the Croque Monsiuer and a hibiscus lemonade.  My husband ordered the steak and eggs and a screwdriver.  \nIt took another 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and then our food was brought out immediately after. We barely had our drinks before the food.  \nThe Croque Monsiuer looked good but wasn\'t that good.  The bread was dry.  The cheese and sauce were bland.  It was supposed to come with fries but they ran out so they brought me a different potato.  I didn\'t want those so they exchanged it for a salad.  The salad wasn\'t bad but it really bothered me that they just brought out another side without asking me what I would want since their fryer was broken.  \nMy husband\'s steak was beyond bland.  I"m pretty sure he put a pound of salt and pepper on it.  \nOverall we did not enjoy our meal here.  All of the food was lacking in seasoning.  To say that our service was slow and lackluster would be an understatement.  Some may describe the restaurant as cozy but I would say it was cramped and closterphobic.  With so many great places to have brunch in the city this place was a real miss and disappointment for us.' u'Really nice quaint cafe for brunch. The crunchy French toast had amazing texture - crunchy outside and soft brioche inside. I wish it had a more buttery flavor. Breakfast burrito was just good. Overall quality of food was excellent. Fresh ingredients and came out piping hot. Great service and cappuccino was excellent. Would give 3 stars for flavor but 5 for service ambience and quality so averaging to a 4.' u"I went there for breakfast.\nI had waffle and flies chicken it was AMAZING .!!\nChicken was tender and no bones. \nThis place is always packed. Also the  service was great.\nThe host and waiters were polite and friendly.\nHighly recommend restaurant in Hell's Kitchen." u"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon without a reservation and it was packed! Luckily there were seats available for two so we got seated right away. The only frustrating thing was that we were seated at a corner of a rectangular high-top table against the wall. It felt really cramped--especially with all the waiters rushing back and forth behind our backs. BUT the food and drinks really made up for this small inconvenience.\n\nWe ordered the Eggs Florentine and Steak & Eggs with Orange Juice and Big Kaunas. Wow. More than satisfied. The hype is real! \n\nEggs Florentine - the eggs were poached perfectly the hollandaise was on point and the sauteed spinach was prepared lightly with a subtle dressing PLUS you got that amazing oozing yolk when you cut into the egg (ohhh yeahhhhh)\n\nSteak & Eggs - the steak was done at a nice medium rare the eggs were ordered over easy and the potatoes were bomb (the eggs were placed over the awesomely seasoned potatoes so you got that beautiful stream of yolk running down your spuds)\n\nIf you love juices and smoothies you must order the orange juice (a simple breakfast staple yes but it's like you can taste the fresh squeezes with every sip) and the Big Kaunas! I think the Big Kaunas smoothie might be my favorite smoothie ever--it has pineapple coconut mango guava agave and coconut water. If only they opened up a separate smoothie store..." u"I would give this spot 3.5 stars if we could do halfsies! :)\nWent to Blue Dog for a boozy brunch with the hubs on Memorial Day. We ordered a Queen Bellini Bloody Mary huevos rancheros and chocolate chip pancakes.\n\nThe drinks were delicious. I highly recommend the queen Bellini- its the perfect amount of spritz! The pancakes were probably the tastiest they had a whipped ricotta with lime topping and a dulce de leche dipping sauce. The huevos rancheros were great but I do not think they were worth the hefty price as it literally was only tortilla cheese salsa and beans. (No meat)\n\nMy only cons besides the price (which I understand because we were in Hell's Kitchen) was the service. It was a bit lacking I know there were plenty of people there but the place is pretty tiny. We didn't get water until about 15-20 mins after being seated. And I felt like our server kept forgetting about us." u"The service is a little underwhelming here for the prices. I had the salmon burger which wasn't as good as I was expecting. Great location and good cozy atmosphere." u"Stumbled upon this awesome little spot before seeing a show. It's conveniently located steps from New World Stages and after opening the door we knew we found the perfect place to get a quick drink and appetizer without being rushed to get to the theatre. Happy hour is 3pm-8pm perfecto! Not sure if this is the norm happy hour times in this area but that is an awesome amount of time. You my boy blue (dog.)\n\nThe beautiful wooden tables are communal which is cool but doesn't feel at all like you are on top of each other at all. We were immediately served water given happy hour menus and asked what we would like to drink. I ordered the special blood orange cocktail and we asked for homemade potato chops with truffle dipping sauce and teriyaki wings.\n\nWill say the cocktails were a little on the weak side but definitely tasty. The food came out quickly which was great since we were trying to make a show. The teriyaki wings were wonderfully crisped and the homemade blue cheese dipping sauce was superb. Homemade chips were seasoned great not too salty and so thin they almost melted in your mouth.\n\nVery happy with our happy hour choice and it looks like they switch up their cocktail list pretty regularly. If I ever see a show at New World Stages again this will definitely be my go-to pre-show-cocktail spot." u"A friend recommended Blue Dog last time I was in town on business. I tend to avoid the theatre district because I used to live in New York and am not big on tourist-central dining. However I will surely visit Blue Dog again next time I'm in town. Even though it was crowded the service was really great. Chris the host was very welcoming and accommodating. He took great care of us until our table was ready. It's amazing what a solid first impression can do for an entire dining experience.\nThe wait staff was friendly and efficient and the food was delicious. Everyone recommended the french toast and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly flaky. Great coffee. Looking forward to my next trip east and another meal at Blue Dog." u"Went for brunch recently with some friends. It was packed of course the wait was about 20 minutes which was expected. Most of the seating is a long shared table which has a nice homey feel and the decor is lovely.\n\nThey had lots on the menu but I ended up with dulce de leche waffles which were pretty good! I also got their regular brewed coffee which was darn good! One of my friends got the pumpkin French toast which was impressively large almost half a loaf of bread with a bunch of creamy filling in the middle. \n\nThe wait time for the food was quite long especially for brunch. The waitstaff wasn't incredibly attentive but they were very busy so I don't fault them for that so much. I understand that they are in midtown and that brunch is notoriously busy which is why they're getting four stars. I'd return!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
44.O’Lunney’s,[u'Came here on a Saturday after a matinee show. Place is huge! Bar is gigantic. \n\nAppetizers: French Onion Soup: delicious! But seasoning is different than your norm. I loved it and would definitely get again\n\nMeal: Cheeseburger was juicy and delicious. Fries were addicting and with the aioli sauce ugh!\n\nBeers were reasonably priced being in NYC. Large selection on draft. \n\nIf in the area definitely check it out!' u"Great pub near Times Square.  I don't normally find myself in the area but this is a good place to stop for a beer or food.\n\nI ordered the fish and chips and was very happy.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly." u"We were hungry when we arrived at our nearby hotel since a cross country early morning flight put us into NYC in the late afternoon.  I had scoped it out ahead of time and it seemed to fit our needs.  I had the shepard's pie and it was delicious probably the best of our meals.  My hubby had the brisket which was okay but a little bland.  Our daughter had wings and they were okay but not great.  We also shared a salad which was pretty good. \n\nWe were thankful this pub was close by for a good meal in NYC!" u'I want to start off this review by reminding everyone that in order to populate this establishment one must be physically present in time square. A must for tourists but for New Yoh-uh-ck-uhs this is eye roll worthy. I must say though due to my avoiding TS like the plague all of those flashing lights and shit still impress me. \n\nAfter literally ascending and descending mountainous snow piles (this was the day after the snowstorm last week) I arrive to O\'Lunney\'s. I\'m not enthusiastically satisfied with NYC\'s snow removal performance. My compadre has not arrived yet. unamused face. I\'m the one schlepping from the east side here. Whatever I snag a table and hold down the fort. \n\nWaiter comes over to see what my deal was. I ask about the existence of happy hour specials here. There aren\'t any. Um...ok?! Maybe due to the time square foot traffic this isn\'t necessary? Regardless be forewarned. What can I say? There\'s just something about discounted prices that gets my juices flowing. By juices I mean bile. Only blockheads gets those other juices flowing. Wink face.\n\nMy compadre arrives. He has the same question for the waiter. Classic. I wonder if they get asked this often. Please go and ask this.\n\nSo I order a downeast cider bc it is my FAVE. Waiter comes over and pours it in the can. He then abruptly says "oh wait...there\'s something on the can" and leaves with the cider and glass. He then comes back with a new glass and a new can. Holy shit. Is this standard service? Do I have unusually low expectations that this pleasantly surprised me? I probably wouldn\'t have noticed and was super impressed. heart this waiter. \n\nHere\'s the thing about the vegetarian options on the menu. There aren\'t really any. Classic again. My fault for not actually checking the menu before giving my approval for going to this place. Due to the length of time required to decide on a place to go the one line of a yelp review I saw that said "this was my son\'s favorite food of the trip" or some shit sold me on this place. I have to take responsibility for my oversight. \n\nLuckily one of the specials was an omelette with ham cheese and peppers. The waiter was willing to comply with my request to leave out the ham. Thank god. My compadre got the chicken quesadilla with bacon. Bold choice.\n\nService was good. Waiter kept coming over for our copious number of drink refills. It\'s been a long few weeks ok?\n\nFood arrives. I have to say those \'dillas looked tasty AF. My omelette was FAT and fluffy. After drenching that shit with pepper and tabasco (I know no other hot sauce choice unfortunately) I went to work. Fries were nearly perfect and crispy. Ketchup was unnecessarily difficult to get out of the bottle that I almost GAVE UP. Can yo ubelieve it? \n\nUltimately the bill was pricey. We did get a lot of drinks. Maybe it\'s just time square. I might choose a place in a less touristy/expensive location next time but this was a good find. Not as bad as applebee\'s or chili\'s or something along those lines. Not that that\'s a high bar to clear but you knwo what I\'m getting at. \n\nAlso I would like to share with you a photo of an ostrich I drew yesterday. It\'s actually a mystery how but somehow I got hot sauce on the first copy so I had to redo it. I know. Fuck. I call it "ostrich frolicking in the snow". Enjoy. UPDATE: ostrich has been taken down. Cry face.' u"Been here twice recently with coworkers. Food is fresh. Staff is friendly. Service is fast an courteous.\n\nThe burger is about as good as you can get. Delicious and juicy. I even like the pickle wedge that comes with it. I hate pickles. I love that pickle wedge.\n\nFish and chips... flaky crispy HOT from the kitchen.\n\nWonderful selection of beer. I don't hate beer. But if I did I'd love the beer they serve here." u'Wanted a quick bite before a matinee and just hate the chainy time square choices.  Used my trusted yelp app and saw this pub got great reviews so decided to give it a try.  Many traditional pub choices and a diverse selection of specials but hubs and I were in the mood for a good burger and this one was fantastic.  Just perfect and the fries were as well.  Service was fast and friendly with zero waiting for anything.  Great selection of beer and wine and very reasonably priced.  I recommend this spot when in Times Square!' u"First Irish pub I've been to in NYC so I don't know how it compares to the rest. I went here twice within a week because my friend who was visiting loved this place. I thought it was ok and more of a convenience to Times Square. \n\nI tried the chicken pot pie. It was a big portion and filling but it's not the typical chicken pot pie with the pie crust dish. It's more of like a flaky crust on top. It was disappointing in that sense.\n\nThe second time I went I was in a rush and just got the seasonal spinach and grilled chicken salad. Nothing special but it took forever to come out!!\n\nThe environment was relaxing though and people seemed to be having a good time." u"We were sat in 15 minutes -- a party of 8 + a baby without a reservation on a Saturday night in NYC - wow that's worth a few starts right there!  The staff was nice while we waited playing with the baby and chatting to make us feel welcomed.\n\nThe table was in a great spot with plenty of space - also unusual for NYC usually you feel like you are eating family style with strangers :)\n\nThen the food just wow's and omg's all around!!!  My friend is from Australia by way of London so she is an expert on what real Irish food should taste like.  She ordered the Bangers and Mash - which she ate happily with a smile saying it was the closest she has had in a long time.  The only complaint she had was there was no peas but it didn't diminish the quality in any way.  Her daughter said that (except for mom's home cooking) that it was quite possibly the best Sheppard's Pie she ever had!  I had to have a taste ( or 5 ) and totally agree!  The mash potatoes didn't overwhelm the carrots and peas didn't get mushy the flavor was just delish!  I had the ruben which was amazing.  The bread wasn't greasy as you find in many establishments these days.  \n\nAnd if you have read my reviews before then you know I had a beer :)  The selection was great!!  Usually an Irish Pub only has Guinness and the like with some Bud or Coors in the mix.  This place has such a great selection of IPAs that I would suggest this even for a happy hour hang out !!" u'Super disappointed by the bartender.  We visited this bar on 10/17 and our bartender was working really hard to make us feel unwelcome.  It was hard tell if he was just having a crappy day or was homophobic.  My friends ordered Jolly Rancher Martinis from him only to see a smirk.  (They were delicious).  He barely spoke a word to us and after we finished our drinks we went down the street to a bar where we were treated nicely.  There was a second bartender there who was trying to cheer up the situation but our bartender was not having it.' u"Great food and great service. I was hesitant to get anything because other reviewers were saying the food was terrible but they were so wrong. Our entire table was more than satisfied with the potato skins fish and chips pizza and the chicken nuggets the kids ordered. The waitress was lovely I can't remember her name but she was very sweet and accommodating. If I weren't leaving NYC tomorrow I would definitely return. :)" u'Great spot for a beer and some of the best fries (or should I say "chips"?) in manhattan. Added bonus: most of the staff are legit Irish folks with brogues. Highly recommend.' u"I really liked this bar! Especially considering it's in the middle of the theater district. It doesn't have the times square feel at all and it wasn't too crowded on a Friday at 6-8 pm. We only went for drinks so I have no idea how good the food is." u"I wasn't impressed. The service was fine and the restaurant was clean and accommodating. But the food was less than mediocre. I ordered the bangers & mash and they gave me some maple-flavored smoky links with whipped potatoes frosted on top and just a hint of shallot gravy. To me bangers & mash should be big manly sausages with nice globs of potatoes underneath and drowning in savory gravy. I also was very disheartened that they served my Guinness in a 12 oz glass instead of a pint glass. Guinness should be served by the pint--not like a Coke in a 12 oz glass." u'They serve an Irish Breakfast every day until 4 PM. \nFast service friendly Irish bartender.' u"Ok...crazy I know. Go to an Irish pub and get Italian. But I did and I'm glad. Cold rainy night and this place was close. Had the chick parm.\nOutstanding. Nice red sauce. Good\nFlavor not overbearing and the parm on the chicken was perfect. I did have the house Irish bread. Lots of it....the best part of the experience was the service. Michael G was the perfect waiter and it seems that both of the owners (Dad and son?) where the perfect hosts. Great experience in the big apple." u'I was here with my mother the other night at the bar after seeing a show nearby. Our bartender Natalia was such a sweetheart. Really funny and accommodating! She poured me a great pint of Guinness too. I will definitely be back to see her soon!' u"Not my first visit to O'Lunney's though just as pleasant as on previous occasions with the attentively friendly staff very decent fare and equally decent beer! \n\nIt is well located on Times Square itself and a hostelry that this particular traveller was very happy to happen upon once again. And looking forward to the next visit already." u'Stopped in for a few pints on my last trip to NYC & this was a great pub. There was a private party upstairs so I drank at the downstairs bar. The pub is very inviting and has very cold pints of Guinness. What more can you ask for?' u'Ok...Here\'s MY TIP..."Never I say\n"NEVER" bet on the Buffalo Bills or \nthe Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl\nbut if you want a great meal and have a fun time go to Emmett O\'Lunney\'s \nand meet the man himself.  \nA legend in his own time and great guy. \nGreat Service! Gave us a pen. Should\nhave got his autograph...Dean' u"The Shepard's Pie is outstanding. Brisket dinner also very good.  Delicious bread. \n\nBut only Guinness for dark beer. Why not Beamish?  Or some other choice?\n\nExcellent service. Reasonable prices for very good food. Classic bar nicely maintained.\n\nBut the bottom of my Irish coffee was filled with coffee grounds. Left an awful taste and texture in my mouth. Don't order this!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
100.Beyond Sushi Midtown West,[u"BEST vegan sushi EVER!.... EVER .. did I say BEST? Out of this world! Dear goodness can you please open stores all over the country (specifically Dallas) .. I'd be eating there everyday! 5 stars isn't enough .. I want to give this 50! 10 wouldn't even be enough. \n1. Ridiculously Amazing Food \n2. Amazing Prices \n3. And Super Friendly Service \n\nGoodness .. I want to go back .. and eat the entire menu! I mean we ate a lot.. and finished all of it. My husband who's a really sushi connoisseur (and not vegetarian) was actually impressed and enjoyed the food and gave it a 9 out 10 best veg food he's ever had. \n\nI just want to go back asap! Please come to Dallas\n\nThe current seasonal roll by the way was my favorite even though they were all exceptionally awesome .. also listen to the servers recommendations of most popular sushi. Our server was on point .. the best rolls were the ones that she mentioned had the best reviews .. even if all were awesome!" u"This restaurant has become a go-to for me whenever I'm in NYC!\n\nThe sushi is colorful full of veggies and delicious. You won't feel bloated after eating a lot - it gives you a good kind of full satisfied feeling.\n\nIf you're craving something healthy and tasty Beyond Sushi is the way to go!\n\nNow the real question is when are you going expand to Los Angeles?! Not sure why this kind of restaurant doesn't already exist yet because this is genius. This would be a hit for the vegan and foodie community in LA!! Please expand you are sure to make tons of revenue from investing out west! If you're waiting for a sign this is your sign. You're welcome. :)" u'Just tried the lunch special that included a wrap and starter soup. I opted for the curry and asparagus soup. It was terrible! Basically broth but if curry and four pieces of asparagus. What the hell! \n\nWent to tell the cashier about my disappointing soup and she could care less and said basically "too bad\' \n\nSo in top of the crappy soup terrible customer service. \n\nWrap was good but will never eat here again. Don\'t get the soup!\n\nTo add injury to insult the girl did not credit my initial purchase which was a wrap only. I changed my mind and decided to get the lunch special for a few bucks more. So come to find out she charged me $11 for the first wrap and another $14 for the lunch special. \n\nNot only is the food not good they will double charge you when they can. \n\nCould have been the cashier. Sad they only hire young kids who can\'t handle these situations.' u"What a great find! I was a little apprehensive about eating at a vegan sushi restaurant but it was FABULOUS. We ordered the chili mushroom noodle soup and it honestly tasted so good almost as if it was made with real meat. It had a little hint of spice just enough to warm us up for dinner but not over powering. We ordered three sushi rolls. That place the noodle soup was enough to fill three people with a few pieces of sushi left over. The green machine sushi roll was my favorite!! Would highly highly recommend! Don't let the vegan aspect frighten you. I am by no means vegan or even a vegetarian and even I would come here again!!" u'Am I vegan? No. I enjoy my all my meaty food on the daily so I was actually quite surprised how much I liked the sushi here! Despite everything being made out of vegetables I would highly recommend this place even to the all the meat lovers. All the rolls we ordered were great and presented beautifully! The price was also very reasonable! Great place.' u'This is such a cute little restaurant very clean inside almost made me forget I was in the city. The staff was very friendly and always had smiles on when talking to customers. Food was really good. I had the Spicy Mushroom rice paper wrap had mushrooms noodles and cashews inside. It definitely lived up to its "spicy" name. It tasted very fresh. \nWe also ordered some dumpling and it was absolutely yummy! It was cooked perfectly and the sauce is legit! My boyfriend had the Mang sushi roll and that was really good as well. \nThe food is great and fresh nice staff and price is reasonable. Would definitely come back!' u'Interesting concept and selections. \n\nI got the lunch special and chose the Green Root noodle salad and the Mighty Mushroom sushi roll. The food was definitely healthy and tasted fine. It was a bit bland for my tastes but I would still come back if I ever felt like eating vegan for lunch.' u'I was pleasantly surprised by this vegan sushi spot. The soups and sushi are delicious with good flavour and textures. What can be improved is the ordering/receiving your food system as it takes too long and is a bit chaotic. There is also limited seating.' u'I wanted sushi... but I needed vegetables. Enter vegan sushi.\n\nI had the Fiesta Roll the Nutty Buddy and the Green Root Noodles. I ordered via Seamless and delivery was ~35 minutes to Midtown / Times Square area.\n\n- Fiesta Roll: Meh. It was definitely good for me and I liked the black rice-- coheres together much better than brown rice. The bean puree was interesting but not that flavorful. The toppings inside the roll just tasted like cucumber. The sauce alongside it didn\'t help but soy sauce did. Would try a different roll next time.\n\n- Nutty Buddy: Awesome little wrap. Nice mixture of textures with the vegetables and tofu and the peanut sauce is great. A little hot sauce helps perk this up but this was already my favorite thing here.\n\n- Green Root Noodles: Good! The "green tea noodles" just tasted like soba to me but that\'s fine. Seaweed salad was great and the almond and cilantro was abundant. I added on avocado which was fresh and beautifully arranged but it\'s not optimal bang for buck.\n\nWould recommend getting at least 2 things since the portions are small but everything is pretty cheap here. A nice and healthy pick in Midtown. Will continue to explore the menu.' u"It's all about what you order here!  After my first visit left me underwhelmed I had not put Beyond Sushi into my regular lunch rotation. Fortunately I decided to stop in again and try some of the other menu items. I ordered the lunch special and got The Badge dumplings and La Fiesta roll. Both were incredibly flavorful and delicious!  The tomato guajillo sauce that came with the sushi roll was my favorite part. \n\nI'll be back!  I'm so glad to have a good vegan lunch nearby." u"Interesting vegetarian spot I wanted to try even tho I am far from it lol \n\nFood:\nNutty Buddy: Very good I feel like this is the best paper wrap here but I haven't tried the rest lol It is def filling and healthy = smart choice\nLa Fiesta Roll: I just wanted to try it. Its exactly what the description is haha I don't like it but I don't like those ingredients too much anyways but if you do then its on point.\n\nOverall: Even tho I didn't LOVE this meal this is exactly what I ordered and they it all tasted fresh and wasn't too bad on price since I had the lunch special. Great place to try!" u"I've heard of Beyond Sushi for years. Although I'm not vegan I do frequent vegan food establishments simply because I'm not opposed to it I like to explore and I do enjoy the creative and tasty offerings. I really enjoy seeing ingredients with nutritional value non-GMO being used to promote clean vegan and beneficial eating. Anyway I tried a variety of rolls:\n\nLA FIESTA\nBlack rice avocado chayote and pickled jalape\xf1o topped with black bean pur\xe9e and kaffir lime chips\xa0\nSauce: Tomato guajillo\n\nSUNNY SIDE\nBlack rice braised fennel sundried tomato and avocado topped with butternut squash\xa0\nSauce: Almond pesto\n\nCHIC PEA\nBlack rice roasted eggplant artichoke and English cucumber topped with saffron chickpea pure\xe9 and parsley\xa0\nSauce: Tahini\n\nSPICY MANG\nBlack rice avocado mango and English cucumber topped with spicy veggies\xa0\nSauce: Toasted cayenne\n\nThere was also a special roll for the day which I forgot to note the description and was amazing - favorite roll of the meal. \n\nAll the rolls were enjoyable - really impressive. I like sushi the traditional way and appreciate the vegan versions. Many pros in terms of flavors and a few minor cons. The only con worth mentioning is that one roll gets 5 out of 5 while another roll gets 4 out of 5. The takeaway is Beyond Sushi earns a spot on my  'it's worth it' 'repeats visits' list. I will be going back to try the other sushi rolls." u"I was honestly shocked to love this place so much! I wouldn't think anything vegan could be tasty but beyond sushi proved me wrong! \n\nI went for lunch and got one of the lunch specials: one roll and an order of dumplings (about $11 and change). You can mix and match; I got the spicy mang roll and the smokey tom dumplings. Both were amazing and surprisingly very filling. \n\nSince my first visit I have been back for more. I now have tried all three dumplings they offer (the badge and fun-guy); each one better than the next. I think my favorite is the badge. Next time I am going to try a rice paper wrap!" u'My favorite sushi in the whole world!!!\n\nThe first time I tried this brand was years ago at NYC Veg Fest...I have been hooked ever since!\n\nQuality ingredients consistently fresh just amazing.\n\nSpicy Mang and the Mighty Mushroom are my jam.\nI could seriously eat a million of these rolls...or any of their rolls and I would NEVER get sick of them!\n\nMany different items on the menu...there is something for everyone. Their miso soup hits the spot on a cold cold NYC day!\n\nWhen I order veg sushi anywhere in the world I always think about Beyond Sushi...\nAnd nothing else will ever compare!!!!!' u"Love this place! A bit on the expensive side but still affordable compared to other New York City dining prices. Can't speak for the other locations but the 56th street one is a bit tight in terms of space. Nonetheless very healthy and hearty! Definitely a great alternative to typical Asian/Japanese cuisine. Lower in calories and higher in good nutrition! Everything on the menu looks extremely appealing. My absolute favorites are the Mighty Mushroom roll and Spicy Shroom rice wrap. Only a matter of time until I try everything on the menu!" u'During my teenage Wisconsin years I was a vegetarian.  Back then more often than not restaurant menus felt like minefields forcing me to navigate around the likes of Butter Burgers and Brats ISO something... anything I could eat.  For my senior prom I remember going to Benihana\'s where the kitchen was so thrown by my request for a meatless main that I wound up with a plate full of sauteed bok choy.  Only bok choy.  Veganism is next level.  It both fascinates and annoys me. I definitely felt a bit of both during a recent meal here.\n\nAnyway since hubby and I have commitment issues (jk) we weren\'t ready to go all in with a full meal.  Instead we shared a lunch special; this particular one featured our choice of (1) Sushi Roll and (1) Rice Wrap for if memory serves $11 and some change: \n\nSpicy Mang Roll:  Big black rice fan so I appreciated its inclusion as a stand-in for the usual white stuff and that it never fell apart as I was eating.  All the ingredients including avocado mango and cucumber tasted fresh.  But dammit where was the promised spice???  The menu boasted of a "Toasted Cayenne Sauce" that looked to be a salmon pink-tinged faux mayo (Veganaise?) dolloped onto each Roll slice..  But it and the Roll in general were bland with a capital \'B.\'\n\nCurry Flower Rice Wrap:  This is cutesy for Curried Cauliflower included with a bunch of other ingredients like green tea noodles squash and asparagus.  I could at least taste some curry with this but found myself wishing it hadn\'t been served so cold so that flavor could pop even more.  It was also drizzled with some utterly flavorless tahini sauce that tasted like it was diluted with water and that\'s it; no salt and pepper; no nothing.  \n\nBottom line:  This is a fun concept but it could be so much better if more attention was paid to FLAVOR.  Unfortunately for me this place affirmed the whole \'vegan food is bland and lacking in umami\' perception.\n\nps  Limited seating is available but this looks to be a popular Midtown lunch spot so plan around that if you want to enjoy a relaxed dine-in experience.' u'::FOOD:: They have the best vegan sushi! The flavors are comparable to the regular fish-filled sushi. The foods are very refreshing beautifully presented and instagram ready. I really like their Spicy Mango Roll Nutty Buddy Wrap and Fun Guy Dumplings. \n\n::AMBIENCE:: Low key. Modern. Layback. Caters mostly to takeout customers. Limited seating.\n\n::SERVICE:: Very friendly staff and are happily ready to give their takes on the recommendations. \n\nOverall I will be back to try more dishes.' u'Obsessed! this place is so amazing for vegans and non vegans. Delicious fresh plant-based sushi. And I love the sauces. This is the future.' u"The sushi has always been good here I haven't had a bad sushi here yet. It's a small place and was kinda crowded when I came so that kinda sucked & there was no bathroom. I had the curry noodle soup this time and sent it back because it had a very bland flavor and I didn't want to eat it. I like the other location better." u'Wow! Stopped in on a whim after looking for food on google and so glad we did! All vegetarian from what I could see totally unusual and absolutely delicious. The Spicy Mang roll was excellent. I also had the Sassy Bean noodle salad which surprised me as it was warm but also tasty. We also tried the Badge dumplings and Sweet Tree roll and everything was just so yummy!  \n\nThey have several lunch special combos so you can try two out of their roll or noodle salad or dumpling or whatever. \n\nThe place is adorable but does not have a lot of seating. I was surprised that they came to the table to take our order as There was a woman at a register taking orders. \n\nThe two of us had a special and bottle of water for about $28. Not bad at all and so unique! Loved it!'],0.636,0.807,0.193,0.0
91.Mercato,[u"Anytime I'm back in Manhatten I will remember to stop by Mercato. The bartender was amazingly accommodating and every was very friendly. They have a great selection of authentic Italian food and wine. \n\nI stumbled upon this place at random and couldn't be happier." u"I am in full agreement with David S recent review. Food is extremely mediocre. We had the almond tomato pesto pasta which was just ok. We ordered 2 glasses of wine which tasted like table wine for $13 a glass. We were extremely rushed all through dinner. Food plates were cleared before we were done. I was still enjoying the bread when my plate was taken away without even being asked if we were done. As soon as the table was cleared dessert menus were placed. We declined dessert and the check was promptly brought to the table. We decided to enjoy our more than half full glasses of wine and pay when we were done. The waiter came to collect the check about 3 Times and then started to get annoyed. That's appalling service. Also they suggest an 18% or 20% gratuity for awful service!\nFurthermore many of the tables are really close together so there is no privacy. It looks like they like to cram people in and rush them so the tables can be turned around quickly. With the amount of Italian restaurants in the city I would not recommend enjoying your evening somewhere else. \nWe were never asked if everything was to our liking. I could understand this type of service being ok in Italy but it doesn't go down well in the US.\nRestaurant is extremely noisy." u"In a town that has more restaurants than time to eat in all of them I don't have time to waste eating mediocre food. This place has a limited menu and I'm not sure they understand their own cuisine. \nThey call their food Italian however Influenced by Italian would be a better description. \nWe recently ate at Mercato with a group of seasoned diners and not one of us had anything positive to say about dining at Mercato. \nThe food was just average for a NY restaurant and for Italian it was lackluster at best. \nTheir service was less than attentive and somewhat rushed. \nNeedless to say in a town that has countless Italian restaurants there are many choices I would return to or recommend and unfortunately Mercato is not one of them." u"You can enjoy amazing mozzarella appetizer.\n\nThe menu is Italian so it may be difficult to imagine dishes if you visit here for the first time (there're English explanation about ingredients of course).\n\nYou shouldn't miss the Straciatella. It was my first time to eat speck and fresh mozzarella. The taste was creamy but not heavy. I believe you'll love it for the rest of your life!!\n\nAlso I like the atmosphere of this place. The brightness is just right." u"Mercato is a gem within a very mediocre neighborhood for good food (besides Thai if you want Thai 9th Ave is the place to be). I really enjoy their pastas and sometimes come for Friday lunches when I want to treat my self. It's average priced for restaurant food and I love their seafood pasta orecchiette with broccoli rabe and anchovies. Service is nice and the place is cute but teeny tiny." u"Went in Mercato for a late but a light dinner. The bread and lentil/olive dip were absolutely wonderful.\n\nI ordered the caperse salad and the quality of the cheese was great the tomatoes could have been more ripe but still enjoyed it a lot just delicious I wish there was more basil on it. I didn't try any of the main entrees so no comments there.\n\nThe service was great and everyone was very helpful." u"I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food was really good.  I had the Moscow Mule for a pre dinner drink it was great tasting but weak.  I really didn't taste much alcohol at all.  To start we had the caprese salad which was decent and came with some prosciutto the octopus with potatoes was delicious and the olives from the appetizers list which was good but a bit pricey.  Again the food was really good but a bit pricey so I'm still giving it a 4 star.  If in the neighborhood I would go there again.  I had the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare which I have to say was delicious and was a good portion.  That really filled me up." u"I have been coming to Mercato on and off for quite a few years now and continue to be impressed with their consistently high quality and excellent service. Last night's dinner was outstanding. \n\nIn addition to the food there are a few other observations I would like to address. I have read some reviews here that claim they have had problems with reservations at Mercato. I called on Thursday for a reservation for two on Friday at 7:30pm with no problem. On Friday morning I called again to change the reservation from two to four. Again no problem. Both phone calls were cordial polite and professional. We were attending an event around the corner and got a slightly late start on our walk over to the restaurant. At 7:31pm I received a phone call from Mercato asking if we were coming. We arrived about 2 minutes later. The place was packed to the rafters inside and a long line waiting outside. We were greeted with a big friendly smile and taken immediately to a perfect table for four all set and waiting for us in the back room. (The back room is my preference because it is a little quieter and has a somewhat more romantic and homey feeling). This was our experience last night. We have never had anything but excellent service and treatment from staff and management there so I don't know what others are complaining about. \n\nWe began our meal with three antipasti: eggplant caponata fave e cicoria and mussels in white wine olive oil and garlic. All three were as delicious as could be. In fact the fave e cicoria was good as any I have ever had in Italy. Even the bread was above ordinary and is served with a yummy concoction of lentils and olive oil in place of butter or just plain olive oil. Though if you prefer plain they will provide it without hesitation. \n\nOur main courses were short ribs in a tomato based sauce with a side of mashed potatoes...5 STARS ravioli con ricotta e spinaci in buttery cream sauce...5 STARS  tagliatelle ai funghi...3.5 STARS and spinach pappardelle with sausage ragu...5 STARS. The portion of short ribs in addition to being scrumptious was enormous. Easily enough for two and the sauce was one of the best I've ever tasted. Our dinner was accompanied by an excellent bottle of Nebbiolo wine. \n\nAfter so much delicious and savory food there was absolutely no room for dessert so I cannot make comment about that. However the people seated next to us had several amazing looking desserts served them and they seemed to be enjoying every bite! \n\nIn conclusion I must mention that the service was outstanding too. Our server was charming and professional. There were no delays or problems of any kind. Initially we ordered three glasses of wine and then changed it at the last minute to a full bottle so it did not surprise us that three glasses of wine were first served. We pointed out the error and it was corrected instantly with no issue whatsoever. \n\nMercato is a busy restaurant in a very busy up-and-coming neighborhood with many hotels close by. They have maintained their standards and high ratings attracting both tourists and locals. Hopefully they will continue to do so." u"Beet salad was long on beets and light on dressing. Needed something else with acid - some vinaigrette and goat cheese. The capers/ lentil dip was not great - very bland.  The gnocchi in meat sauce was good but I've had better. And they did not offer fresh cheese." u'Let me start this review off with how impressed we were with how many awards this restaurant had. This place is rated with Zagat year after year and even has multiple Michellin star recognitions. \n\nWe had our eyes on this place since we got to NYC! This place was walking distance from the hotel we were staying in. So we said "hey why not". \n\nThis place was by far superior to other Italian restaurants around town. \n\nThe food is unspeakably delicious! \nWe ordered: scale of 1-10. \n\n1. Mixed fried seafood platter (8)\n2. The house special Lasagna (9)\n3. The mushroom pasta (+10)\n\nEvery dish we ordered came out smelling like a Italian grandma\'s kitchen and we were so glad we stopped by!' u'Excellent food and service. Intimate space great atmosphere.  The fettuccine fungi was amazing ravioli was fresh and perfectly balanced and the specials (grouper with rustic potatoes and braised short ribs on truffle polenta) were simply heaven.  Our group loved this restaurant.' u"Eeny Meeny Miny NO!! Last minute trip to the city and we wanted italian. I briefly looked at reviews...4 stars okay and it came up as best of something when I Googled it so let's go! Without no further or due there's NO way us New Yorkers come here. Tourists must keep this restaurant afloat. The food was subpar. How so you may ask? \n\nFor apps we ordered prosciutto and fried leeks (the leeks were good but the concept just didn't work) and the mussels were as memorable as my Jets lasts few seasons well more than a few lol. I had no desire to sop up the juice (for those that know me know I love mussels). \n\nFor entrees we ordered can't go wrong lasagna and the cavatelli with wild boar ragu. Let's say that if I had a choice between their lasagna and stouffers I'd choose the latter. Both entr\xe9es were bland. Now I'm not a salt fiend but I had to throw it on heavy. The waiter or whatever he was (although pleasant) had the nerve to #1 cosign these dishes and #2 ask how they were! I really wonder when's the last time they tasted their food. When your 11 year old can cook up something so much flavorful there's a problem! \n\nThe best thing we had was the lentil-capers oil dip. Oh and the setting is intimate. \n\nUnfortunately for me I will never hear the end of it by choosing this place and my dining choices have been revoked for the next few outings :/" u"This is such a great spot to meet up with friends or for a date. It's a place where it's not too quiet or too noisy. I was here about 2 weeks ago to meet up with friends for dinner. Fortunately we were able to get a table on a Friday night without a reservation. The service was wonderful! Our waiter was attentive and gave a run down of the specials. Every now and then our table was checked on for refill of water drinks etc. \n\nWe shared appetizers- rucola salad and stracciatella. The rucola salad had a bit of everything from being sweet and tart to crunchy. The combination brought out a lot of flavors. The stracciatella was really fresh. Originally my friends were interested in the tagliere pugliese cured meats and cheeses platter.  Unfortunately my diet is limited these days since I'm not able to eat cold cuts being pregnant. So they changed it to stracciatella despite my protest. I love that Mercato is similar to Pepe Russo Social one of my fav Italian restaurant. The food was rich but not heavy. I had the cavatelli with braised wild boar ragu and it was hearty and good. Though I do like Pepe Russo's version with the shredded meat. Mercato's uses ground meat. It makes a difference in overall texture. The rest of my group had ravioli cavatelli with wild boar and linguine with seafood. They all enjoyed their dishes and complimented that the food was delicious. While the rest of the table opt for wine I stick with an iced tea. \n\nFor dessert I had the tiramisu and a cappuccino. I stick with the classics since every place has their own version of the dessert. My friends had the panna cotta and affogato. Of course you can't go wrong with desserts. Mercato's was def exceptional! Overall we had a really good and relaxing time. Def will return again in the future to try other dishes." u"As someone who spent quite a bit of time in the Philly/ Wilmington area I have a soft spot for excellent Italian. To be honest homemade noodles are the key to my heart. This was pretty darn good but not the best. \n\nTo start we ordered the special appetizer. (Fried artichoke hearts with a mild pastrami). Decided to try the pisco sour they had on the menu as well to mello out a bit..\n\nMy wife ordered the ravioli dish and I the gnocchi with beef and pork ragu. I must say the ravioli were excellent. A very light filling that didn't stab your heart like most.. my dish was served smoking hot with a perfect sprinkle of Parmesan but there was something missing. When it came down to it I expected a little more than mild." u'I had the pork shank with mash potatoes. Wow! It was so amazing . Huge  I mean huge ! Pork shank .\nIt was so tender and juicy  full of flavor . \nI love this restaurant. Every time I go to New York I go there . It is romantic and tiny . \nApp was meatballs  they were flavorful . \nHe got the gnocchi with braised pork Ragu and  spinach . He loved  his dish . \nMy pork was so big I had them wrap it up and felt terrible for it to go to waste  I could only eat a quarter of it . We had them wrap it up with the untouched spinach and gave it to a homeless gentleman . \nWill always go back to this restaurant and would recommend .' u'The special menu prosciutto with figs is super super delicious! The linguine was also good but we are not very fond of the spaghetti. I would like to go back to try more other dishes :)' u"A nice hidden intimate spot a stones throw from Penn Station. Don't be fooled by the nearby ambience you'll be impressed when you walk in and think you've stepped into a tiny restaurant in the heart of Italy. \n\nAs for the food you'll know you're not in Italy even if they're boasting about the pasta being home made. However the pasta of the day orecchiette with sausage was delicious and by far the best thing we ate." u'Delicious fried calamari/shrimp appetizer.  I had the pesto which had great flavor and was very authentic.  Service was not great but food on point.' u"Went here with two other people everyone agreed that this was a nice choice for Italian. It's nice when you get a few opinionated people together to come to a consensus.\n\nThey offer more of a cozy home cooked type of dining experience. As with most NYC places it'll get busy fast. We had a little wait but we got in at a decent time. The pasta was very good and the sauce was nice too. My co workers loved their dishes as well. Prices were fair for being the Big Apple and all. Solid choice for Italian." u"The food here is sooooo gooood!!! They start you off with bread and some olive oil dip (so tasty). I got the caprese salad perfect. My main course was the ragu gnocci served piping hot. They definitely waited until I finished my appetizer to start cooking this dish because it took a while and came out piping hot (compliment not a complaint). You can tell they didn't just microwave some leftover pasta and serve it. It was the best comfort food I've had. waiter was very nice and attentive as well. My lunch was a little pricy overall but so worth it!"],0.5467,0.282,0.718,0.0
184.Black Iron Burger,[u"Came in here off of yelp reviews and wanting pub type of food. We got their draft cider which was a black cherry that was very good and refreshing. \n\nWe started off with fried artichokes which was awesome.  Got the club chicken sandwich which was great and very nice big piece of chicken. Also the black iron burger which was cooked exactly how I wanted and was pretty good. Fries and onion rings were nothing too crazy but still good. \nService was top notch never had to worry about a dirty dish. \n\nSide note we asked for a side of ranch and when I checked the bill it was an extra $1.25. Unless stated in the menu we didn't know this." u"The tempura fish burger is good - but the fish itself isn't that flavorful. It says whitefish on the menu - not sure which one it is ;) \n\nThe cajun fries were good. Service was a bit slow but understandable since it was lunch time and the place was packed!\n\nOverall I'd go again." u"A friend and I came in here Thursday when they opened at 11 am. We were celebrating birthdays. Mine was that day hers had been about 2.5 weeks before. We sat at the bar. We were the first and customers at 11.\n\nWe perused the menu. We were considering French fries but decided against it and I am glad we did because we were full from what we did order.\n\nThey have a number of signature burgers and you have an option to build your own by choosing type of burger and whatever toppings you decide on. I don't believe you can choose your own bread.\n\nMy friend ordered the Black Iron burger double patty. I ordered a single beef patty with tomato grilled onions jalapenos and pepper jack cheese.  We also got an order of fried artichokes to share. \n\nI ordered a Brooklyn lager to start and my friend ordered a hard cider. After that we ordered margaritas instead of shots. They were decent even with well tequila.\n\nThe fried artichokes came out first with a nice looking aioli. I don't believe either if us had the aioli. They were crispy not too oily nor too much batter.\n\nWhen the burgers came out they hadn't combined the top and bottom so you could see inside your burger.\nThe meat was juicy. The combination I chose seemed to work well and wasn't too hot. You could tell it was good meat.\n\nMy friend also enjoyed her burger although she didn't finish. They gave her a to-go container." u'The service was good the food was really tasty. My friend got a burger and sweet potato fries. I got guacamole and yuca chips with a Caesar salad. We shared our food it was enough to fill us up. I wish they gave me guacamole it was in a very small Container. The waitress was kind and helpful. It was a nice calm atmosphere and dim lights. For the city it was a nice quiet vibe. I recommend!' u'Since it was just a random stop for 3 hungry souls walking from late night at the gallery - I was pleasantly surprised by rather great burgers. And decent fries actually.\nAs they advertise it is all about meat. Seriously delicious patty - juicy tasty and perfectly done to your order (I like my meat rare thank you).\nThey do advertise beef being antibiotics-free hormone-free etc and that usually what wins on taste at least in my experience.\nI had Little Italy Burger - that gorgonzola really kicks it up.\nTwo things to take as advice:\n- ask for lettuce and tomato if you wish for it they will not put it on burger without you asking\n- they got no coffee (but plenty of other drinks - I was happy with Jack but we had rather hilarious situation with one of our friends wanting coffee)\nWish they would add bun choices! (pretzel buns please!)\nService was quick and friendly.' u'Placed an order for delivery between 10:30-11am. Finally at 11:30 and it still hasn\'t arrived I called to find out what the deal is. I\'m then told the kitchen doesn\'t open until 11am and it won\'t be delivered "anytime soon." That\'s great... I ordered on YOUR website and YOU gave me the checkout option of 10:30-11am. I have a crew of roadies that need to eat before heading to MSG for tonight\'s show and no food. I would expect this from a major delivery service but not the place itself. We haven\'t even tasted the food yet but we ordered because of the awesome Yelp reviews and then experienced this. Felt the need to give a heads up to anyone else deciding to order early through their website too.' u"Delicious food wonderful customer service. As a Texan we know how to throw down on some burgers. NYC-you didn't disappoint when I needed a fix. Below-mushroom truffle burger Little Italy Burger and herb garlic fries." u"They make a great burger; there's no denying that fact.  I would definitely come back for another.  The burgers are a little small but still rather dense so you'll still get your fill; if not order another because they are that good anyway.  This is a good spot for lunch or to catch a game with a beer and some good food or just to stop in before an event at MSG.  The service at the bar seems to be the way to go as a lot of other reviews harp on the service aspect.  Our bartender/server was a cool lady with an interesting accent.  She was very pleasant and fun to talk to.  The beer selection is not immense but it gets the job done for the area.  I believe they also offer a happy hour as well (don't quote me on that).  All in all I have no real complaints here.  It can get a little tight in here so if you come for lunch get there earlier if you expect to have a seat for a group.  If you're solo do everyone a favor and go to the bar.  Enjoy." u"Simple place with a decent menu for their burgers. If you are dining alone anything more than a burger will be too much to order  \n\nI had the classic cheeseburger with avocado topping and it was well prepared nothing special. Just a good burger.\n\nCan't comment on any other items as I was in for a quick bite to eat. The portions are average and if you are big eater you may want to order a side of fries with the burger" u"Black Iron Burger is my boyfriend and I's go-to place whenever he is craving a good burger for a reasonable price. We never have any trouble getting a seat and their location is great for when you're coming from the Jacob Javitis Convention Center or the Port Authority Bus Terminal. \n\nTheir Famous All Natural Burgers come with double patties so you're not going to leave hungry. If you're not feeling any of those choices you can make your own burgers and get whatever toppings you want for the additional price. All burgers are served on top of a piece of wax paper and metal plate. Perfect for catching any of the caramelized onions or yolky goodness from the Masterpiece burger that can spill out. \n\nThe fries are always long and thin fried perfectly. You cannot go wrong with the aioli fries or the loaded fries. Noticed a lot of deliveries going out so a great place to order from." u"My boyfriend and I went for a pretty late dinner and the place was still live.. The burgers were outstanding!! We ordered the Mushroom truffle and the masterpiece burgers and the mushroom truffle is one of the best burgers we've ever had. The masterpiece burger was mediocre in comparison but still good.\nFor sides we ordered the garlic fries and onion rings which were both very good but I think next time I'll go with regular fries the garlic was a little too overpowering. \nThe place is pretty casual and chill with good service." u"I had the masterpiece and sweet potato fries. I can say that the food did not disappoint. The place had a bar feel but wasn't  too crowded. Definitely a great place to grab a good burger and have a few beers. Draft selection was also very good." u'Was at Ace Bar and needed a quick fix. They delivered quickly. Burgers were good but the fries were meh. Was also kinda pricey; $48 bucks for 2 burgers and fries.' u"I must admit that I will go into any place that has burger in the title and is not fast food.  So when I ambled by Black Iron Burger I had to check it out.  \n\nAt first glimpse the place is pretty small since it was busy it was a little tight with the other tables that were around us...but not too bad that it was an issue.  The beer selection was a little bit lacking in craft selection...possibly that I am just spoiled with all the places in the city that can overwhelm you with options.\n\nThe burger menu could have been a little more diverse.  They do have the option of building your own burger...but the options for toppings and sauces weren't as varied as places like the Counter or Bareburger.  That being said I went with the Black Iron Masterpiece.  The burger was above average the fries were as well.  Not sure if they always come out that way but it was quite the messy burger.  The combination of the carmelized onions the runny egg and the slightly below medium rare meat made it drip all over the place.  Not that this made the burger taste bad at all...just make sure you have a pile of napkins and don't let any drip on your shirt!\n\nThe one thing that does need to be focused on is their attention to service.  It is not that our server wasn't pleasant...because she was...she just didn't have an eye on our table at all.  I had to get up and go to the bar to get my drinks multiple times and also again when we were ready to leave to ask for the check.  I know it was busy but the effort on that end was a little lackluster." u"Decided to go to Black Iron Burger for date night. This is our 3rd time here and we're never disappointed. The food is sooo good and the service is also great. The food is always on point. Definitely one of our favorite places to go for a burger." u"Based on dining in.\n\nOrdered the wings and black iron burger: both were tasty.  You have to order the fries separately.  The cajun fries were tasty but I wish they were a bit thicker.  The burgers are a bit small so they're definitely not good for sharing. \n\nThe waiters were really friendly. \n\nI'd go back again." u'Maybe it was hunger or the fumes from rush hour traffic that early evening but I swear I saw a bloody finger pointing from cow to burger on their sign. Thought to myself that\'s a little extreme - the burgers must be awesome!\n\nWell it was a meat cleaver but same difference. They definitely take their meat seriously here. You\'re getting a massive portion of it in every burger and a variety of options to add to it if you\'re feeling creative. For those of us starving can\'t think for ourselves folk their "famous" burgers are already hooked up with fixings that make sense in your mouth. Try The Masterpiece (if you\'re especially hungry) or The Mushroom Truffle Burger. Who doesn\'t love a fried egg and truffle oil???\n\nThe sides of fries are rather small which is to say they are what a normal portion size used to be. If you want to dip them into anything other than table-side ketchup it\'s an additional charge. The Truffle Mayo was totally worth a dollar more. \n\nThe full bar could definitely keep you there way beyond Happy Hour but lucky for us commuters Penn Station is a hop skip and a burp away.' u'Hopped off my megabus during the rain and sought shelter and food with a friend checked some nearby area with yelp and was not disappointed!\n\nNot sure if it was our growling stomachs or our wet socks speaking here but the place was delicious and the service was really great! \n\nThe price for NYC standards was extremely reasonable I personally hate paying $15 for food in the city! I had ordered a patty melt which was $10.50.\n\nThe waiter even taught me how to correctly tap on a ketchup bottle !' u"Based on Yelp reviews we selected Black iron burger to fuel ourselves for day of walking NYC and we are so happy we did!  The three of us HAD to choose their signature burger and NO REGRETS!  Perfectly done TWO patties with horseradish mayo (I asked for more because it was sooo good) topped with a slightly toasted bun. We also ordered two orders of their delicious fries to share.  There are several variations but we chose the Truffle Fries AND Herb fries with a pesto mayo drizzled all over.  HOLY NEW YORK CITY.  Finally just to round out our meal we ordered a caesar salad to share.  It was a great meal all around. \n\nBlack Iron's ambience is that of a pub but we didn't drink any beer - we just ate our hearts out.  The space is tight as the building itself is narrow but surprisingly even though I was sitting in the aisle I never got bumped or crowded by the servers or otherwise.  Perfectly fine lunch ambience.   And I have to say that our server Katherine was outstanding." u"Black iron burger is a delicious little burger spot located minutes away from the New Amsterdam Theater. BIB isn't the most spacious spot but I wouldn't call it cramped at all. Their burgers are delicious their quality of burger taste delicious without any special toppings. Their french fries at solid too. Only thing I disliked was that we had to purchase fries separately from our burger. \nSolid burger joint."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
49.Adel’s Famous Halal Food,[u'AMAZING! \nFresh. Friendly. Fast. \nGot lamb gyro with rice and white sauce which was awesome and basically took me back to my time in Egypt. Also got falafel with spicy rice topped white and spice sauce. Spice btw Tabasco and Sriracha. Would reccomend to stop and try it.' u'Adel\'s Famous is always my go to Halal cart when I\'m in NYC. But perhaps over the years the charm has worn off. I got my usual lamb over rice with white sauce and hot sauce. At first I was so hungry I was inhaling it. But as I slowed down and as the red and white sauce became more scarce I realized something.\n\nThe lamb doesn\'t have much to offer. It has a subtle taste and spongey texture acting more as filler than meat. It doesn\'t provide anything in the way of mouthfeel as it breaks down quickly as you chew and not in a lovely "melts in your mouth" way. The lettuce helps to add some crunchy texture. \n\nThe rice is decent nothing special wouldn\'t eat it by itself but it provides the essential surface area and balance for the proper dose of sauces. The flavors all ultimately blend together into one vague but tasty mess of rice meat and sauce. The pita bread also absorbed a ton of sauce and was delightful to eat by itself. \n\nDespite my criticism I\'m a sucker for meat with rice and hot sauce. Adel\'s is still very reliable and I will absolutely be visiting them again.' u'Better quality of food than most carts including the halal guys.\n\nAsk for just chicken and vegetables if you want to skip the rice in your platter!' u"Hands down the best halal I have ever tasted. For a price of $7 (w/ a drink) you get a lot of food. I usually get the chicken with spicy rice and they have the yummiest rice. It really adds to all of the flavor. Their hours are a little weird though. They're only there after 6pm on weekdays which sucks because sometimes I get a craving and would have to wait. It's worth it though. I will keep coming back to this place as opposed to the other famous halal chains around the area! If you're looking for good filling food and you're around Rockefeller this is the place to pick (even though there are so many around).\n\nThis is located right at the corner of 49th St. and 6th Ave. A must-try!!!" u"Great food great portions and great price. \n\nAdel's halal platter was far better than Halal guys! They were cheaper (Adel $6 vs $8 Halal Guys as of this writing) and they actually had a rotator split for gyros meat. Plus their food was not dry like Halal Guys. Halal Guys was too dry and oily when re-microwaved.\n\nAdel's halal platter's portions were big. I could only finish half of the portions the last 2 times I visited. And they didn't hold back on the sauces. They topped the foods with lots of white sauce. I liked the tangy texture of the combination of foods of their Halal platter much more than the dry version of Halal Guys. \n\nSince my bad experience with Halal Guys Adel has become my go-to place for Halal food now." u"Decided to try Adele's after a friend recommended it. I've been used to going to the Halal Guys for over 13 years now but it's lost some of its muster for me since I stopped eating meat and the falafel'a there frankly suck. So went to Adele's after an event in the city one evening -- they're only about two blocks away from Halal Guys!\n\n- Food: I got the Falafel Platter (~$7) which came with Falafels spiced rice salad and grilled veggies as well as white and hot sauce. I absolutely loved the falafels! They were hot delicious and practically melted in your mouth! The spiced rice was very good as well although you have the option of getting regular rice as well if you'd like. It's a lot different than the Halal Guys rice but seems to be more fresh and hot. \n\nThe only downside at Adele's compared to the Halal Guys is the white sauce which the Halal Guys still hold dominance over but Adele's sauce is not bad either. I do enjoy Adele's hot sauce better though although it's not as spicy as Halal Guys so get extra if you're a beast with spice. Also the onions were a bit too overbearing for me so might tell them to go light on the onions next time. \n\nOverall loved Adele's and will be my new go to for street platters!" u"After reading some good reviews on this place I had to try it and see if Yelp really does work.\n\nWell good news. It works for me at least in this case.\n\nThey had yellow rice and spicy rice option and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I purposely didn't take a lot of sauce so I could actually taste the food.  This cart is about equivalent to my favorite cart which also has a choice of rice and also chunks of chicken that are delicious.  My fav cart does also have grilled onions which makes the dish taste extra yummy but Adel's has better mix of greens.  I think I even got a tiny piece of broccoli in there somehow.   \n\nFor $6 this is a great deal.  You don't get any pita bread like with Halal guys but I feel Halal guys has quantity and Adel has better quality.  Halal is famous for their sauces but Adel's non-famous chicken wins out over it (at least for me).\n\nI would definitely recommend anyone who raves about Halal Guys to try Adel and see the contrast in styles and tastes." u"I gotta say this is probably one of the best platters I've ever had. There is a lot of good going on here. This was was recommended by a friend and he talked about it so much we drove all the way to the city (about an hour from us) just for this platter. To be honest I think it was worth the drive.\n\nI ordered a mix gyro platter with the spicy rice and I pretty much drowned mine in white sauce. White sauce is key. The spicy rice might have been a bit overpowering for me but I still thought it was pretty good. My mother thought the spice level was perfect. She actually said this was the best platter she's ever had even though she had it an entire day after I bought it home. Anyways the actual lamb gyro meat which you see displayed on a rotisserie was tender moist succulent and juicy. Chicken was great and very flavorful as well. Both meats were awesome. The salad added a nice crunch to the dish. Topped off with some white sauce this was very tasty. Portions were very generous even though the tin looks small. When you pour it out of the container and into an actual plate it's a ton of food. This is coming from someone who consumes well over 3000 calories a day and is used to eating a lot...\n\nLike every single other platter I've had it's a bit over-salty and greasy but this was probably the least saltiest and least greasiest I've had. I would definitely recommend this gyro spot to anyone." u"My go-to halal stand when I'm too lazy to make dinner.  Their chicken over rice is $6 compared to the overpriced $8 at the Halal Guys.  The portion size is decent and the chicken is very tasty.  The platter also comes with pita bread.  Only complaint is that there tends to be a bit of a wait everytime even when it looks like there's nobody in line." u"The chicken and gyro are both juicy here and at 2 am they were still cutting fresh lettuce. I've tried Halal guys and I prefer Adel's. The portion is smaller here but the value is top notch. The flavor of the gyro is especially good. Also the red sauce here does not burn your face off.\n\n$6 combo on rice - it's what you need at 3am." u'This is Adel not Adele. \n\nThe location for this food cart is accurate    \nAdel shows up on a Saturday night with his food\n\nFood is okay. \nI am not a big fan of halal food cuz it always makes me uncomfortable while finishing it \n\nThis one is no exception. \n\nBut still it is a good food for working people nearblu\n\nPrice: very cheap\n \n3 stars' u"Happened to stop by last night and I was super impressed. Probably the best halal truck I've been to in a while. \n\nI got the lamb over rice with extra white sauce. The lamb was very flavorful. I chose the yellow rice which was perfectly cooked. \n\nIt comes with pita bread and a salad. Even the pita bread had some seasoning and the salad was not your generic old lettuce it had fresh pieces of vegetables. \n\nThere's a chase across the street just in case you need an ATM." u"Not much to say other than the fact that the rice chicken and lamb all taste way better than Halal Guys and it has more of a kick for all the people that complain about the lame taste of HG. You can put it on the same level as Sami's in Jackson Heights/Washington Square. \n\nIf you are desi you will like this lol" u"Great food on a budget.  Got the chicken/lamb combo with rice and salad.  Spicy rice adds some kick and the red sauce adds even more.  Great flavor and plenty of spice.  Adel's was recommended to me and I don't think I'll bother with any other Halal cart now... I'll be coming back.  All that wonderful spicy flavor for only $6 bucks?  Take my money!" u"Folks this is it. This deserves far more props than Halal Guys and is totally underrated. I got the mixed platter with chicken and lamb with spicy rice. Absolutely amazing!\n\nShort to no line bang for your buck smells mouthwatering and tastes even better. What's not to like?" u'I arrived at 5:30pm and he was just starting to set up so I walked around--I should have stuck around because when I came back at 6pm he already had 4 or 5 orders ahead of me. I ordered chicken with rice and it came with some pita bread. It was a huge order just like all the other reviewers stated. I also got a side of falafel. All for just $9!! I loved the food and the spicy sauce they put on it was really spicy--perfect! I even had them give me additional hot peppers on the side. This is some of the best mediterranean food I have eaten.' u"Go here instead of Halal Guys if you're in the city and near Rockefeller Center.\n\nI got chicken over rice and it was fresh portions were large and spicy level was perfect. It is one of the best in Manhattan (it is not the best in the city because Steinway halal will forever be the best in NYC sorry!). \n\nWill be back!" u"This place was recommended to me by one of my friends and it is absolutely the worst experience I've ever had eating in NYC. First of all myself and the two other gentlemen I was with all got food poisoning from eating at this place. That should be enough to deter anyone from eating here. I'd like to also point out that the food was horrible. Flavorless meats and the sauces weren't as tasteful as other carts nearby. Avoid this place at all costs!!" u"This is much better than halal guys I got the 1/2 lamb 1/2 chicken with spicy rice and salad platter and it was delicious super flavorful and not too salty. Next time I'm gonna ask for extra white sauce bc that stuff is delicious." u"$6 for mixed combo platter half spicy half yellow rice with white and spicy sauce. Didn't have a problem with prices like some other people here.\n\nPersonally I think the quality of this food is better than the famous halal guys. The pieces of meat are good sizes and the flavors are on point. If you're in the area stop by!!\n\n1 downside is the hours. Can't swing by for lunch since the cart opens at 6pm (sometimes even later)."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
9.Patzeria Perfect Pizza,[u'My first trip to NYC was a couple of weeks ago and I just had to try a slice of New York pizza.  Found this place on yelp so tried it out.  \n\nIt was great.  Tasty.  I had a slice of spinach & Ricotta.  YUM!  \n\nThis place was packed out.  Line out the door.  I think there were maybe 4 bar stools inside but that about it.  Everyone is standing outside.  I just got my slice and a beer and luckily some guy left so I was able to sit down.\n\nIt was funny because I asked for a menu and the guy just looked at me.  Haha.  No pizza menu just what you see!' u"Came here for a slice of pizza last Friday... walked right past it at first.\nTried the white pizza.\n\nIt was very very heavy/dense. I guess I was used to a thinner slice with not so much cheese piled on. I couldn't finish it but it was good. \n\nUnfortunately all the pizzas had WAY too much oil/grease. Yes I know pizza is greasy but this was a ridiculous amount." u"We were looking for what we know as a piece of new york pizza and this place did the job. \n\nYou walk in and it's small and quick moving. We ordered a slice of cheese a slice of pepperoni/sausage and a slice of mushroom/spinach. \n\nThey cut the slice off and put it back in the oven. What comes out is amazing. The sauce isn't heavy the cheese is perfectly melted and the crust is crispy but not hard. I loved that the sausage was sliced not ground chunks. \n\nWe got exactly what we were looking for." u'Maybe we came at a bad time or what.. but we\'ve had better.. expect overly dripping oily pizza with bland service. We couldnt expect more. Pick your slice... they cut and throw it in the oven.. pull it out and serve reheated pizza with crispy crust. yay..\n\nWe got the pepperoni/sausage.. and sausage with peppers.. far from perfect.. but hits the spot if you are on a good one if drinking.. which we were not.. \n\nyes.. they got plenty of reviews.. which brings in traffic.. but unless you get the lasagna pizza.. which seems to be the 5star.  id say pass. plenty of spots around that have pizza by the slice. \n\n2 slices for $11.. pretty steep to me.. and labeled as 1 "$".. \n\nlasagna pizza = yes- per other elites..\n\nall others = neh.. \n\nthanks.' u"No sign out front to let you know you are in the right place. Rude on the phone and not much better in person. Maybe it was just a bad day for them.\n\nWe called and asked if they deliver. They said yes and asked us what we wanted so we proceeded to give them our order. THEN they asked what the address was and then told us they wouldn't deliver east of Broadway doesn't mater that we are literally half a mile from them. Could we have walked there and picked it up of course but we had a busy day and wanted to chill at the hotel and relax. \n\nThe pizza was meh. I'm not sure what the hype is over it. We will not eat there again. The grandmas pizza was lacking flavor the pepperoni & lasagna pizza was alright but not worth the ordeal. The lasagna was just ok but the garlic bread was gross. \n\nThe salad.... well it was all warm. Not warm as in sitting next to hot food but warm like it was made in the morning and left to sit out all day. The cucumbers were dried out and yellowed. \n\nJust not sure why the food is so mediocre when there are so many places to choose from." u"So I've been to New York many a time and I've always wondered where in this amazing pizza was everybody always talks about. Well I finally found it. And in true form it was a literal hole in the wall. This place sits directly across from the theatre wear the awe-inspiring musical Hamilton is being shown. The joint probably has enough room to turn around maybe three times before you've turned back out the door but boy is this pizza amazing. They've got all the classics plus a few extras and you can even ask for special requests. I was with a group of four and we all were able to squish together and have a seat but trust me that's about all this place can take. I can't say enough good things about how amazing this pizza was. I am a believer and I wanna be reminded every time I go back to New York of the moment I fell in love with the New York slice. \nSee Ya Next Bite" u"Definitely one of the better spots for quick cheap eats in Times Square. The broccoli pizza and grandma pizza weren't great but the pepperoni and plain were amazing. I'd definitely stick to those varieties." u"I wouldn't say this was the perfect pizza but it was pretty good. You order inside and pickup at the outside window. I don't know if that's the usual process but I was waiting outside already because there was barely room to stand inside. \n\nI got a sausage pizza with bell peppers. Definitely the size of the pizza is massive and the slice was scorching hot so watch out when you first get your slice. Toppings were extremely good but the crust was a bit weak. The crust tasted good but couldn't hold all my toppings together. Everything was slipping off and when I tried to fold it like a New Yorker all the cheese and toppings spilled over the sides of the pizza. I guess you can't do it when you have too many toppings. Listen learned. If you are in the time square area this is a good slice to pick up." u"Pizza  we're talking about Pizza. Nothing fancy but 100% New York. Hot  fresh ingredients cripsy bottom melted cheese and quick.  I don't always give 5 stars but when I do.... \n\nThis place didn't over think their product they aren't trying to be gourmet. It's pizza. You want to count calories  take your lame tail elsewhere. It's Pizza in Times Square! Wash it down with a soda  and go on about your business. Or as the New Yorkers say  FOH. \n\nIt's Pizza!\n\nI will add I really enjoyed it and it wasnt overly greasy. The store wasn't pretty or sparkling clean...but I didn't expect it to be. It's authentic to me and hit the mark for a quick slice." u"If you want a classic NYC pizza in Times Square without bells/whistles/hype this is the place to be. It's unassuming authentic and is what it is. I don't think they're going for healthy organic or fancy. They're going for a straight honest NYC-made pizza. It might be greasy and the hole-in-wall location isn't elegant but that's the point and the product they will give you is delicious.\n\nBottom line is that if you're in Times Square looking for a enjoyable quick meal be it before/after a Broadway show or you're just hungry and in the area come to Patzeria Perfect Pizza." u"The first thing I can say about Patzeria is it's delicious pizza. The second thing is I pretty much had to re-mortgage my house in order to buy a pizza. \n\nI decided on a half sausage and pepper - half tomato/basil pizza. I wasn't disappointed by the taste. Also - it was plentiful. The slices were huge and even for a big water like me I could only eat two at a time. This made it easy for the pie to last three days. \n\nThe downside to it - my pizza cost me $40.00. Yes - I know it's NYC but damn!  \n\nBottom line - I will go back (with my kids inheritance)." u"If you're looking for a quick bite this is your place. To be honest Omar's was my first choice but since the line was literally down the block and I was short on time I decided to try this place I had bookmarked. While the pizza (got a meat/ricotta slice) was tasty it's a bit more pricey than other slices and there are only like 4 bar seats. Standing while eating is probably going to be your only option if you're just passing through. Eating hot pizza outside the front door on a hot summer day? Ehhh... I'll pass next time." u'Wow the two-star description "Meh. I\'ve experienced better" is so real here.\n\nGot a slice of spinach and mushroom for nearly $5. Interior is nothing to write home about nowhere to sit and pretty hot while you wait. Staff was brusque; I tried to give a card and they asked me if I had cash.\n\nIt came out very very hot but the mushrooms on top were still cold and clammy. Everything else about the slice was ho-hum. Pretty messy and greasy. I felt gross immediately.\n\nShould I start offering a reward for tips on decent pizza near Times Square?' u"First visit to NYC and I'm so glad we decided Patzeria for our first pizza! Small location (some seating) quick wait time for them to reheat pizzas. Recommend to take it just down the street to time square and eat on the red steps. MAJOR TOURIST! I highly recommend getting the Lasagna pizza or the Grandma pizza. My boyfriend has a big appetite so he would have ordered three slices of the Grandma pizza if he knew what it would taste like ahead of time!" u"What's more New York than New York pizza... I stayed walking distance to Times Square so I searched for a top rated pizza spot and stumbled across this one.\n\nStopped by and 2 ppl in line. Place is tiny with 3-4 stools to sit. Ended up ordering two slices of margarita and one lasagna (it's a pizza not the actual lasagna). \n\nNo place to sit so ended up walking to 51st to enjoy. It's pretty bomb! Not the cheapest I've seen around but I'd rather pay for quality. It's oily and full of flavor. \n\nI would stop by again if I were to visit NY." u"Let me be clear- this isn't the best pizza in the city but it IS the best in Times Square!  A tiny storefront just off the main plaza Patzeria's is the quintessential neighborhood pizzeria.  With just three stools at a shallow bar to the right a cold case with sodas and beers just ahead and the main counter on the left displaying the usual wares and the expected pizza ovens just behind that.  That is the entirety of this little establishment and judging solely on their product I'd say it is all they need.\n\nDuring our sojourn onto TS we walked for a while (after walking a dozen or so blocks from the hotel) and soaked in the sights and sounds; I'm from here but it has been a long time since I actually was here.  Man it was good to be home!  Anyway I'd been hankering for NY pizza for the months leading up to this the BEST trip ever so it was time to have that itch scratched.  Not the glutton I was once we ordered a couple of slices of plain cheese- it is my humble opinion that the simple is often the best way to gauge how good a pizzeria is and they did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and well done to a crisp the cheese was piping hot and the sauce had a really good flavor with a sweetness to it not overpowering but noticeable.  Just like every other time I've had NY pizza I burned the roof of my mouth- just one of those things you learn to accept right?  In any event we were well pleased- the staff was funny and outgoing but you could tell they knew what they were doing as the line was a constant flow; order inside get your pizza at the outside window or over the counter rinse and repeat.  However there are other pizza spots in and around TS so it is my intention to try (and review) them all!" u'Came here while visiting from out of town and by the time the trip was over I had probably eaten at 7 different pizza spots at least! Patzeria hands down was my favorite of the ones I tried and definitely gave me a good value for my dollar. Had one of the veggie slices and was impressed with the quality of ingredients' u"This little gem is tucked away in the midst of Time Square... if my hotel wasn't right there I would have probably missed out on  THE BEST PIZZA ever!!!! Definitely my spot look forward to my next visit just to get a slice of heaven" u"Yes Yes and YES! Loved their pizza! I could have eaten there everyday or twice a day it was that good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Wish I had brought a slice back home with me. lol\n\nThey have a great selection I had the white pizza pepperoni and the veggie...not all at once of course :) Veggie was my favorite although I liked them all. \n\nIt's a small shop with only a standing bar to eat at but what else in new in NY. It's a take and go slice anyway.\n\nDon't pass this place up!" u"Great spot for a quick pizza! Thin greasy (but not overwhelmingly) foldable perfect NY style pizza. My fianc\xe9 and I split a classic pepperoni and a white slice. Both were really good! You go inside and there's not much room to stand around so like everything else in NYC be quick about it! You order inside and then go outside to wait for your slice to be ready. When it is the give it to you from this sliding window so you don't have to go back in. It's open pretty late and located right by Times Square too which makes it the perfect late night pizza spot! :P"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
190.Tavola,[u"My mother & I are in town for a couple days visiting the east coast. We are from California. I wanted to eat something good for my first time in New York. We had some recommendations from our tour group but we asked a staff member for soetching good walking distance of our hotel the Homewood Suites.\nYour restaurant was the recommendation. So after hearing that and checking you out on yelp I decided your place would be my first experience of New York. I am so glad we went to your place. We both ended up ordering from the specials our friendly waiter suggested. My mom got the Risotto and I got the pizza special(I'm sorry I forgot the exact names). We both loved our food choices. Our server was very attentive( sadly I've forgotten his name too. It's been a few hours now).  I did take a taste of my mom's risotto with the sausage in it...it was so good! My waiter even brought me out a small bowl of crushed red pepper flakes like he read my mind that I would enjoy it on my pizza( I love them of course). \nI hope the staff gets to see this review because I think they should now positive experiences that were in large part due to them and the food they made for us. I should mention that a very large group arrived while we were eating and th restaurant filled to capacity. We still had awesome service with no pressure to hurry up and leave. So thank you for being my first New York restaurant experience and you all set the bar very high for any place else I might try on my visit. \nI recommend this place highly and pay attention to the specials when the waiter is speaking. Get off your damn phones for a minute and listen. You will be glad that you did." u"Tavola is an Italian place with a lot of character - two brick ovens in the back named after famous Italian volcanoes vintage-y paintings communal tables and above all great food!\n\nCommunal tables does mean it gets loud - and this also probably means that this is not the best place for a large party - but there are a couple two-seaters and individual tables for smaller parties. But I think once you start eating all that noise falls away ;)\n\nOn to the food - my expectations for shared table bread at Italian places is high and unfortunately Tavola was quite disappointing in this area. It wasn't bad but tasted like any old loaf of bread from a supermarket. It wasn't even warm!\n\nBut my main dish - clam pizza - was delicious. Very flavorful - lots of garlic and they didn't skimp on the clams! Also the dough itself was droolworthy! I generally don't eat pizza crusts but I found myself devouring this one.\n\nOverall - great food average free appetizer bread and cozy interior with character!" u"We have only frequented this place at lunch but I would certainly come here for dinner. \n\nNice selection on the menu. The pasta is always fresh and flavorful. I like the rice balls and calamari appetizer. The asparagus and arugula salad was a nice starter salad. \n\nThe salmon was fresh and tender. It was cooked perfectly. \n\nThe pizzas are authentic and cooked on the crisp side. Which I love and my kids hate. \n\nI recommend this place but don't come here if you like quiet restaurants. At lunch time the crowd is loud and it's hard to hear. Worth it for a good meal." u"Great ambience and friendly staff! \nI came here on a Tuesday night for dinner with friends and had made a reservation just an hour ago. The manager greeted us at the entrance and we were immediately seated. Many of us being vegetarians were skeptical at first when we saw  the pasta dishes because all but two had a meat sauce or meat in it. Luckily the waiter assured us that they would be able to change the sauce but they have no cream sauce so it would be marinara which we were fine with. We ordered the viddano and margherita pizzas and two pasta dishes. The food came out well and we loved it! It's usually difficult to find a place that everyone likes and  this happens to be a winner among us. For desserts we ordered the pistachio gelato which was beautifully presented and the chocolate Belgian mousse. Both were delicious but I would recommend getting the pistachio gelato." u"My boyfriend decided on this place as part of his birthday gift since we moved into the neighborhood. From first glance I thought the marinara pizza was my only option along with a salad. To my surprise the gnocchi are vegan as well! 3 sauces to choose from 2 of which are vegan as well (the tomato and the herb pesto- double checked this didn't have any cheese). The gnocchi dish was out of this galaxy good and the sauce so very generous with the olive oil. We also split the arugula artichoke salad and the meal was complete with some delicious Italian bread. Happy hour is till 5:30 and before 5 they only serve pizza. New hood fav!" u"After being told there was more than a 40 minute wait at our first option my friend and I wanted to try we stumbled upon Tavola and to be honest I'm so happy we did! First of all the decor of the restaurant seemed as authentic as it could get for an Italian join in Hell's Kitchen. Open space with a lot of options for seating. We didn't feel cramped when we were in there and we also felt comfortable with the temperature inside on an especially muggy summer evening in the city.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in we were immediately greeted and seated in the middle of the restaurant. It wasn't too packed for a Wednesday night but had enough patrons inside that you knew this must be a good spot to come to in the neighborhood. \n\nAfter reviewing the menu we were presented with a large variety of option which by there descriptions all sounded like pretty good choices. I ended up choosing the Gnocchi Della Casa which my friend choose the Spaghetti Vongole. Along with our dished our server also recommended a great wine pairing which really helped in accentuating the flavors of both of our  dishes.\n\nFor dessert we also shared the Gelato Sicilian Pistachio Amaretto Crusted. An amazing dish to say the least.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this place to those who are trying to find authentic Italian food in one of New York's most restaurant congested area's. If you're not sure where to go and stumble upon this place I'm sure you'll be glad you did." u'Cozy quaint and delicious.  Make reservations  (gets busy) even for early dinner.  The spinach fettuccine was Devine. Great bar good people watching. Good selection of food and wine.  Date spot too!' u"Service sucks came here for a late lunch and we had to flag the waiter down to order get bread get more water etc. There's so many options around here that I probably wouldn't come back but the pasta was decent!!! \n\nTried the rigatoni bolognese which is made with wild boar veal so yummy! Otherwise the salad we tried and the burrata which were both just alright. The flavors weren't as good in the burrata here versus other italian places I've tried." u'Loved the blue crab and lemon pizza so much ! Husband loved his spaghetti vongole so much it was one of the best linguine and clams he has had. The lasagna was good but portion was small.' u"With a cute space reminiscent of a bodega in Italy and a unique diversified menu Tavola had so much potential. However overall we were disappointed as the execution of our food fell short. \n\nTo start we were given bread which oddly was a different bread basket than what the surrounding tables received. I love a good bread basket so I was upset when I picked up a piece only to discover it was as hard as a rock. Then our appetizer arrived - the salumi plate which I usually love. However all the meats - the prosciutto coppa and soppressata fell short. The coppa especially tasted off as the taste of the pieces were inconsistent - the first was okay but my second slice felt like it bathed in alcohol. Luckily the entrees made up for the beginning mishaps but not by much. The gnocchi was served at room temperature; it seems like the kitchen fired this dish too early and it sat waiting on our pizza. Don't get me wrong - the gnocchi was good especially the pesto as it was different from any other pesto we had (this one was more oil based than cheese). Pretty good that we kept dipping our pizza crusts into the sauce. We just wished the dish was actually hot. Our pizza the Maryland blue crab & lemon pizza sounded lovely on paper but the lemon was so overpowering that it was all you really tasted. The dough / crusts were good though. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pie? Despite our waiter recommending this to us. \n\nThe food at Tavola wasn't bad but there's much better out there." u'Had dinner here on a Tuesday night and ordered the gnocchi and lobster ravioli. Loved the ravioli but I think the gnocchi was a bit too soft for me. It feels like a casual laid back atmosphere I was definitely overdressed. Server was attentive and everything was brought to us in a timely manner.' u"Gnocchi - deliciously light. Sauce was tomato basil and tasted fresh. $18 plate is right for 1 person. \n\nSpinach fettuccini. W chicken meatballs with a tomato cream. A great serving for $18 in midtown. \n\nThe decor is very nice. Not too fancy but not casual either. \n\nThe bread was very cold and that's why i was disappointed. Also i felt the cheese Parmesan should be freshly grated." u"Maybe it was because I got there at 8:30 but the wood fired salmon was quite dry around the outer edges. It came out so quick I'm thinking it was precooked. I was surprised at how quick. The menu said there were pine nuts but those were absent so I asked. The waiter asked the chef and came back to say the pine nuts were in the pesto couldn't taste the pesto but that's okay I enjoyed the salad and middle of the filet which was a bit moist. Dry fish is hard to swallow so I had to leave that. \n\nI love the ambience in the place. Wood fired stove is neat. It's really cozy and quaint. The staff is terrific. Next time I'm in the city I'll give it another shot. Maybe not the wood grilled salmon even though that's my favorite." u'Schlepped over to 9th ave from 6th on a FREEZING cold Saturday night after a paint and sip class. I was wasted but it was literally so cold that my alcohol induced altered sensorium didn\'t put a dent in the chill. We were doing one of those speed walking shuffles. The avenues are longer than the streets ok?\n\nWe enter and the place is packed. Even though it was super busy we were seated immediately.  \n\nI have a bone to pick with the lack of bread. HELLO?!?!? Why else would one go to an Italian restaurant? Maybe they knew I\'m trying to cut back on my carbs. I would have appreciated something to soak up all of that delicious olive oil and garlic that would be on the table. Maybe with some parmesan cheese and ground black pepper in it just a sprinkle. Of course when I say delicious olive oil and garlic on the table I mean goose island in my stomach. \n\nConsidering how good the food was I bet the bread they would have would be delicious and fluffy. Perhaps some focaccia also. \n\nOur waiter was amazing. Super friendly. We were already set on the gnocchi the menu says that it\'s "light as a cloud". Find me someone who doesn\'t want gnocchi they could sleep on. \n\nWe almost went with a pizza in addition but ultimately asked our waiter for a suggestion and he mentioned the eggplant parm. Pulled the trigger on the parm last minute. \n\nWhere\'s the bread tho?\n\nAfter a short wait (but don\'t forget about my altered sensorium) the food arrives. Thankfully JK is a "sharing is caring" kind of person. The eggplant parm was really good I easily demolished the shit out of it. Where was the spaghetti though? Am I crazy? Isn\'t spaghetti an essential component of eggplant parm? Tavola must really think I need to cut back on my carbs here. I know I gained a little bit of weight recently but after not drinking alcohol for three days this past week I was asked if I lost weight. Classic. Of course I was asked this while drinking.\n\nGnocchi was divine. I would have to agree that it is light as a cloud. Are clouds gnocchi? Don\'t you think stabbing those little guys with your fork is strangely satisfying? No? Me neither. \n\nWould\'ve been nice to soak up some of that sauce with bread. (UPDATE: I had a dream the night I wrote this review that I went and they gave me bread)\n\nThe service was great the food was great I would definitely come back and bring a loaf.\n\nUPDATE NUMBER TWO (but not the #2 that means poo): as it turns out THEY DO HAVE BREAD HERE!!!!! The fact that we didn\'t get it was just an oopsies. If this happens to you and you WANT THAT BREAD (should I say "bread" again?) just ask!' u"Not a good Italian restaurant--not even a good neighborhood restaurant (and there's nothing in Garment District/Hudson Yards). Eggplant parmigiana was kinda soggy and pasta wasn't tasty. Hard to make pasta not tasty. Appetizers were unmemorable. Place was packed somehow still." u"Margarita Pizza was too oily and bottom was burnt.\n\nHad the Spaghetti Gavole it was decent but not worth the price.\n\nService was rare horrible to be honest. Our server finally got us the bill and it came to $75 for the 3 of us. We put a $100 because we only had big bills and was expecting to get change back but nothing. Waited 20 mins for change and he never came back. He basically self tipped himself $25 for his shitty service that he did not deserve and didn't even say thank you. So we left the restaurant after realizing he wasn't coming back. We left feeling ripped off and got no acknowledgement. \n\nFrom a still mad Canadian Tourist." u"This is my all time favorite Italian Resturant in Hell's Kitchen. Great service adorable atmosphere and delicious food. While you're inside you feel removed from the hustle and bustle of 9th Ave and feel like you're enjoying authentic Italian ambience. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Buratta. I will go there sometimes to enjoy a glass of white and the Buratta. \n\nThe veal ragu papardelle is my favorite entree. \n\nThis place is a MUST." u'Great place for dinner and pizza! It had a lively and romantic atmosphere on a Saturday night. We came around 8 and there was no wait. We both got pizzas that were pretty large. My boyfriends for the one with veal meatballs and onions while I had the vendetta which had boar sausage and mushrooms. The pizza was delicious and had a good charred doughy crust. They were a little soggy though because of the tomato sauce but the knife and forked helped when eating those wet tip pieces. \nStill I really enjoyed my pizza. There was plenty of sausage and mushrooms and all the ingredients meshed well together and were seasoned nicely. The pizzas also both came out pretty fast probably around 10-15 minutes. The one downside was that they never gave us any table bread though I think they also missed the table next to us as well. Still cozy place for some tasty pizza.' u"Great restaurant.  Quick service.  Nice dim lighting.  Good to take family or date.  Nice healthy Italian menu.  I believe I had the spicy chicken meatballs and fettuccine.  Was delicious. Lot of space in the restaurant.  Some tables can be a little close together.  Was there on a Tuesday  didn't have that problem.  Good experience overall." u"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. \n\nWe ordered buratta and it tasted sour. The house salad was good.\n\nI ordered the lunch rigatoni with red sauce. I did like it but the portion was tiny for the price..."],0.1901,0.149,0.851,0.0
135.Pure Kitchn,[u'Tried other bowls including butter squash bowl Russian beet and pine apple. \n\nI think my favorite is probably pineapple and Italians pesto. Butternut squash is a bit too oily and they miss to put walnuts. Either way the most healthy  and fulfilling bowls are here.' u'This place is the bomb dot com. I usually order my salads from juice or fuel in NYC for my health options. But when I discovered the vegan options of cashew cheese chia see croutons and vegan dressing to make a few- I was so excited to try it.\n\nI ordered the Caesar  salad and italian pesto with added avocado & cashew cheese. I requested extra dressing since last time it was a little dry. \n\nWow it is so delicious ! May I also add the italian pesto feeds that carb craving fix without the bloat. I digested all of these foods so easily - I\'m always paranoid about what I eat since I developed candida lately. The flavor as well was so on point.\n\nThank you so much pure kitchn for existing!\n\n6 stars all the way - extra star for health conscious options in a market where we are fed things that poison us. For example Gregory\'s coffee "turmeric latte"- the turmeric added is a syrup lol geez \n\nGod bless you!' u'Came here using the AllSet app and had a great experience. I ordered my food ahead of time and was notified when the order was confirmed and "all set" which made the process so much easier for me. \n\nAs soon as I came in my food was ready. I\'m in love with the falafel bowl everything tastes so fresh and it\'s colorful beautiful super filling too. The beet hummus is amazing. This place is great if you\'re looking for a healthy option. \n\nI\'d even consider this a hidden gem because it\'s almost in a basement sort of location. You walk downstairs and honestly I walked right by it the first time. \n\nThe interior is SO cute. There\'s a chalkboard with cute cursive writing on it the place almost gives off an indoor picnic kind of vibe. The colors are super adorable and it\'s great vibes. I\'d love coming here to read/do work/whatnot. \n\nService is super friendly as well. They brought me water to my table. \n\nSeating is limited as it\'s a small cafe. Around 20 people maybe less max. There\'s tables and also a small corner bar you can sit at.' u"It's a little hard to find if you choose to dine in among all those steakhouse and seafood restaurants there's this vegan-friendly hidden gem. I had the Avocado and Beet Salad with basil avocado dressing. How can I resist something when the ingredients are on my top 5 favorite food list? It has beets avocado and grape tomatoes and is really tasty. I would come back to try the beet hummus." u"Full disclosure I am not vegan. I'm just an oddball that likes to try vegan food. My friends and I came here on a Friday night to grab a quick dinner. This location is a little difficult to find as the restaurant is below ground level. \n\nThe space is very cute and only has about 4 small tables with chairs. There are also counter space. For food I had the highly recommended Mediterranean bowl which comes with kale baked falafel almond feta and beet humus. It was very colorful. I thought the falafel was a tad too bland though. My friend's Mexican bowl was more flavorful. \n\nThe sweet lady who might be the owner was so kind. She brought us water and our food even though the restaurant is set up like a take out place. Great place to grab quick lunch or dinner!" u"This is the kinda meal that you feel great after eating. Filling nutritious organic ingredients and decent portions. Delivery is always wicked fast. What more can ya want? \n\n1. Vegan sushi bowl ($9.95) - Insanely fresh ingredients but not much going on flavor wise. \n2. Thai pineapple bowl ($10.95) - my personal favorite. This is so filling and satisfying. I'm not usually a fan of mushrooms but the portobello bacon is great." u'The demand for vegan food is on the rise... and so is all the new concept vegan spots.... Located underground clean with open kitchen small simple organic vegan whole food.\n\nGreen Sustainable use of plate-wares' u'Super cute place very small.  All good made in front of you super fresh.  I had the American butternut squash bowl so good so fresh!' u"Outstanding...this was the best vegetarian I've ever had! The bowls we're big and the veggies were sauteed to perfection. The Italian bowl had delicious cauliflower\u200b and pesto and cashew cheese. Also had a butternut squash bowl with seeds rice cheese Gobi berry walnuts..etc. Each ingredient made the bowl even better together. Brilliant and the prices are terrific $10 -$12. This is our new pre-theater dinner go to place. So excited to try more bowls." u"Healthy delicious and 100% vegan. So yes I felt really good about myself after a meal at Pure.\n\nThis is pretty similar to a By Chole. Fast casual salads bowls burgers tartines etc. And just like By Chloe every single item on the menu is vegan. I went with a picante salad and really enjoyed. The portion was very generous and came with a huge scoop of guacamole black beans pico de gallo and chips. The cilantro lime dressing was flavorful and tasted great over all of the ingredients.\n\nMy mom had the butternut squash bowl which is apparently the house favorite. Definitely not surprised the bowl was incredibly fresh and there was lots of sweet butternut squash pieces. My dad had some sort of Italian pesto quinoa bowl and really enjoyed it as well.\n\nI'm not in this area often but if I was looking for a quick and healthy meal then I'd definitely return to Pure." u'I came here for the first time today for lunch after looking up vegan/vegetarian options nearby where I work. It isn\'t "Meatless Monday" but what the hey I wanted to cut back on meat for today.\n\nThis location is fairly easy to find since right outside of its downstairs location on W.46th St they have really large signage that would be very difficult to miss. When I arrived there were no other patrons SCORE! I was greeted by the cashier who took my order quickly and efficiently.\n\nI ordered the Veggie Guac Burger which has portobello mushrooms guacamole spread pickles and cashew cheese. I didn\'t have to wait long fo rmy food it was prepared quickly. The cashier brought my food over with a cup of water. My food arrived hot and what I didn\'t expect to see to come along with my Veggie Guac burger was a side of tortilla chips (combo of yellow and blue corn! YUUUUUM!). \n\nThe Veggie Guac Burger was super tasty; it was hot tasted fresh and wasn\'t overwhelming. The tortilla chips were a nice complement to the savory taste of the burger. It didn\'t break my pockets either; the total for the Veggie Guac Burger was $10.83. That\'s not bad considering that I got a heaping side of tortilla chips (couldn\'t finish them all!) and a complimentary glass of water to wash all that goodness down.\n\nOne of the highlights of my experience today was a saying that was drawn on one of their chalk walls which said "Don\'t consume too much sugar! You\'re sweet enough!" The feels! :)\n\nIf you\'re looking for vegan/vegetarian options in Midtown West/Theater District this is a great option.' u"Such nice people they work here. Got the Mediterranean bowl even though they didn't have enough falafel left so they substituted a veggie burger patty. If you can get the patty instead of the falafel. So good. The falafels were good too but dry.\n\nAnd they hummus is great. You need it in every bite though because the kale is a bit dry as well. Overall good food and you feel good eating it. Plus vegan cheese ftw." u"I just felt awkward the whole time trying to order. \n\nFood was good and healthy feeling. It's a rather small place but it didn't bother me." u"Never in this area but it's great to know there's somewhere good and healthy if I am! \nYou can tell everything is prepped fresh. Will definitely be back if I'm seeing another Broadway show over here!" u"Very trendy vegan/ vegetarian restaurant with some shrimp/tuna for the us non-vegetarians.\n\nIf you need a place to lunch without feeling guilty than this is the place for you. The spot is cozy and I really enjoyed sitting and eating. You order at the counter so I was shocked on how great the service was. They brought me and friend out water when we chose a table to sit at and were all just very kind to us. \n\nThe food is good. It rates fresh and healthy. I got the Thai curry bowl with tuna. The bowl isn't drenched in curry sauce and is a nice balance between all the ingredients. The coconut on top may have been a bit overpowering but other than I ate the whole thing. \n\nMy friend got the best salad which I did not enjoy as much but that may be because I am not a huge fan of beets. \n\nI really like the ambiance here and would definitely be back!" u"Super delish food-I believe we need one in Williamsburg BK!!! I'm so excited to eat here everyday! Cold cherry soup acai bowls are epic!!!!\nFresh exciting vegan food in midtown!!!\nTheyhave burgers sushi bowls tartines- amazing!!!!!" u"I am slowly transitioning to vegan so a lot was riding on Pure Kitchen.  I asked for a suggestion since I didn't know what to try.  I wasn't disappointed." u"This place is a hidden gem for anyone wanting to stay healthy and refuse to give up on flavor! You might walk right by this place f you're not paying attention since you need to walk down stairs to get here. \n\nThe space it self is very cozy and clean. There is a good amount of seating so I don't see finding a seat to really be an issue. The staff is amazing and very accommodating if you need any changes to your order. They're very attentive and want to make sure you're doing okay half way through your meal. \n\nI got the Mediterranean bowl which has falafel and a beat feta hummus thing with kale. It is the bomb dot com. The flavors are amazing and I need to tell myself to slow down." u"Omg this place was an accidental discovery.  I have a hard time satisfying the Inner Health Foodie when in the Times Square area but the nice sign on street beckoned.  It is down the stairs.  Yes don't be afraid.  Go down the stairs ... a hidden basement restaurant awaits you which is divine.   Once you slip in there is a great vibe music great decor comfy inspirational feel to it.  Lotta stuff I wanna try next time.  Very Zen. Zen plus Wifi. Just how I like it!" u"This place is great for healthy lunch - in my opinion they blow Fresh From Hell out of the water. It is a little pricey for lunch but worth it. I rarely feel full after a vegetarian meal but this place leaves me satiated throughout the afternoon which is why I am willing to pay the $11.\n\nThe pesto bowl with kale is great and now I'm working my way through their entire menu. Never been easier to eat my veggies!"],0.4753,0.34,0.66,0.0
101.The Marshal,[u"Here is a photo of the Bacon wrapped corn and sweet potato and kale au gratin. Nice!  \n\nIt's beat to have a reservation here I sat at the bar and met some cool local HK folks!\n\nI'll be back!\n\n#HKRoulette" u"Food here was terrible and a very limited menu!\n\n The frittata i ordered was bland and tasteless. My friend ordered the French toast and it was all BURNT!!! The biscuits were very doughy and not crunchy and tasted undercooked. \n\nWaiter had an attitude and wasn't nice at all. \n\nNever coming back here. Bad food bad service." u'Warning in advance: Make a reservation or wait in front the door so that you can grab a seat right when the restaurant opens.\n\nEverything is farm-to-table here. The owner who is also the main chef welcomed us and was a great host for our group. The chicken salad rib hash and frittata were all delightful--I must admit that the chicken salad was my favorite of the three. The apples fresh greens and crunch walnuts added the right amount of acidity to the perfectly cooked chicken with its savory crispy skin. Surprisingly the hash was not overly seasoned; the potatoes and rib were addicting (I absolutely enjoyed the minced potatoes and rib that melted in my mouth). I left the restaurant satisfied but not bloated. \n\nIt has been a while since brunch in NY has left me impressed--Marshal did the trick and I would return without a second thought.' u'Really cute and cozy place with fantastic service--not overbearing or negligent.\nReally super menu items with fresh ingredients makes for a really great meal and experience. \nI can easily see how this place could get crowded quickly so reservations are a great idea!' u"Service was extremely slow. Food was not good at all. \n\nMy party of 5 arrived on Saturday afternoon at 2pm and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly but slow considering the fact that the restaurant was half empty. Our food took over 40 minutes to the point where I was feeling irritated. My friend got her hot sauce (that she asked for in the beginning) after she almost finished her meal.\n\nI ordered the lobster frittata with sausage and bacon. The menu saids that the bacon were thick cut but its actually super THIN. Mine came burnt and nasty (pic for reference). For $23 my dish was very disappointing. It was so small. The frittata was bland didn't taste the cheddar and the potatoes they served were too greasy. I tried my friend's french toast and it tasted like heavy syrup. She thought it was too sweet to finish. \n\nAfter we finished our meal we waited another 30 minutes to get the check. I didn't enjoy brunch here. The service was just so bad. The ambiance was okay and the food was too expensive for its quality. They claim it's farm to table but i'm questioning that. Won't be returning." u"We took our wedding party here a couple weeks ago. We paid to reserve basically the whole restaurant and pre-planned the menus/drinks etc. \n\nIt was amazing. He food is EXQUISITE here and it surprised by how much we got (we were expecting smaller portions). It IS more expensive but honestly I love paying for good food!! If you're looking for a full super hearty meal go here but do not expect prices that are lower than $15! \n\nLoved being here!!!!" u"Made a reservation here through Yelp for the afternoon on a Saturday for a large group. I was running a little late so when I got there I saw my friend and was trying to flag my friend down at the same time as talking to the hostess. The hostess was kind of rude to me because she thought I was being rude by avoiding eye contact even though I was trying to flag down my friend. It kind of put the whole meal off to a bad start.\n\nI ordered the sunny side egg with spinach polenta and sausage which I was very excited about. However it took forty minutes to get our food! When the food finally came the portion wasn't as big as I thought it would be. The polenta was in fried little dry patties but the spinach and sausage was very good. \n\nTowards the end the hostess came backs and gave us free drink coins to their sister restaurant which was nice. So she redeemed herself. Torn between a three and four star because the service was good and bad as was the food." u"The brunch was pretty food but what I won't forget is the spiked hot chocolate. Oh man it was so good whatever Kas Honey Krupkinas means...\n\nI also got their french toast with jam and sausage on the side. I don't have anything negative to say about this place.  Their warm biscuits with whipped butter and cherry compote was so good we ordered two of those orders. The food was different everything tasted great and the place accommodated our party with our reservation almost immediately. They're also very dog-friendly as they let us bring our furry friend. This was a nice farewell brunch for my friends and me and I'm glad we chose this place." u"Good service which is why I give it 3 stars. Not pushy and very friendly in a genuine way. Food was pretty good but the lamb shank was very disappointing. I usually shy away from lamb because I don't enjoy the taste/smell of it if not done right but decided to try it since there were a lot of good reviews. It was not done well and we had to dunk it in hot sauce to be able to eat it. On the flip side the mac and cheese appetizer meatloaf entree and surprisingly the side of bread were all pretty good. I may give it another shot if I'm in the area again but first impression of food was pretty mediocre." u'Amazing brunch! \n\nService was great with friendly staff quick ordering and a delectable explanation of the dishes.\n\nThe biscuits with strawberry jelly cream and brown sugar bacon butter (extra $3) was amazing. Be sure to get  brown sugar bacon butter as it is beyond delicious! \n\nThe pork sandwich had the perfect creamy spread for moisture and watercress-like veggies for that extra crunch. Chips were top notch as well! \n\nWe also ordered the omelet with sausage - savory and cheesy! \n\nBe prepared to wait maybe 15 minutes for a table if you come at 10:30am!' u"Midwestern Gal: very nice evening! I had the special which was a monk fish risotto.  The risotto was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  I know monk fish is supposed to be more steaky than flakey but it was just a little too tough.  That said the food was delicious.  The freshly baked bread was AMAZING. I would highly recommend getting a loaf with the homemade butter.  Overall the experience was wonderful and I would recommend this place to my friends including all of you yelpers!\n\nMidwestern Guy: Stereotypically (being from the midwest and all) I ordered the meatloaf. What a great decision! The meat was cooked perfectly and had a lot of delicious flavor. The tomato sauce on top was the perfect amount of tangy and spicy and the loaf was stuffed with squash and spinach. I would highly recommend ordering this dish! As the gal noted above the fresh bread is a perfect appetizer as it is warm and flavorful. Their homemade butter was good enough to be Amish made! This place doesn't look like much on the outside but I would recommend anyone grab a bite here." u"Freaking awesome! As soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a treat! The smell was intoxicating. A mix of fresh bread garlic and wood oven. Mmmmm. Loved it! The dishes were all supreme. Highly recommended the sinfully good devised eggs! These aren't your mama's deviled eggs hold the paprika laden original and slide me over a huge plate of these bad boys - filled with duck prosciutto ramps walnut pesto and more! Wowza! Soooooooo good. \n\nGet the burrata. The onion ramp and garlic compote on the side was such a nice addition. Mmmm. Get a loaf of fresh baked bread to slather this stuff on. So worth it. \n\nThe mussels were on point too. Super good cocktails and big wine list. The Marshal is definitely an authority on good food! Can't wait to go back!" u'I\'ve been to The Marshal a few times for its farm-to-table goodness at dinner. The rustic interior is casually hip.\n\nRecently we came for Sunday brunch. Both of us had the Smoked Chicken and Hudson Valley Duck Bacon Hash with topped with poached eggs. Mine came with Esposito Bros pork sausage while Jonathan K. selected Berkshire bacon. Each serving came in its own little cast iron skillet and was so delicious! Everything is fresh and made from scratch. We gobbled our food pretty quickly.\n\nI was surprised that the Bloody Mary wasn\'t all that special just ok and with less "fixings" than I would\'ve expected just an olive and a lemon slice.\n\nService was friendly. We\'ll definitely be back again. The Marshal is usually fully booked so open an account at reserve.com (too bad that\'s the only way) and snag a spot.' u"Not a very friendly place. I went the first time and they told me I needed Reservations so I left. I made a reservation tonight for one and when I got there I was told I had to sit at the bar. A lot of places don't like to serve single people but if one has a reservation for one person they should not be given a hard time. Left feeling very discriminated against." u'Tiny little place with local produce from nearby farms.  The main courses are great but the desserts are killer.  The Marshall is within a few blocks of The theater district so an early dinner and a show are easy to do.\nI had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese and delicious green beans.  The mac n cheese looked incredible and the sides were imaginative.\nAs noted the desserts are incredible.  We had the apple crisp with home made ice cream.  Absolutely sublime!' u"We arrived earlier than our 1:30 brunch reservation by about 45 minutes but were seated in 15 minutes. We had to wait outside but they gave us each a blanket to keep warm. So thoughtful of them. \n\nThe service was so warm and personable. I felt like I was at someone's house. The owner/chef was so hospitable and friendly. \n\nThe food was fantastic! The biscuits are so amazing. There's this special butter that's optional if you order them get it! It was spectacular. \n\nMy eggs bacon and sausage were delicious. Everything cooked to perfection. My cousins loved their meals as well. \n\nI would 100% come back here for the service alone. I love the chef/owner and his staff!" u'Food looks good but is it? No.\n\nOrdered a coffee and a tomato basil mozzarella frittata. \n\nFirst off my coffee came with some white bits in it which I still do not know what to make of. Perhaps cookie crumbs? Dandruff from the waiter? Anyways thankfully they switched this out for a new cup that looked pitch black - the only way I like my coffee to be. \n\nThe frittata was incredibly bland and lacked any flavors. Would it hurt to put some spices.. salt.. anything?! I drowned mine in hot sauce which arrived when I was half way done with my food. The "thick cut" bacon is just normal breakfast sandwich bacon which they only give two pieces of by the way. \n\nService was incredibly slow for a half-full restaurant. For example- the hot sauce which took half a meals time to arrive. \n\nWould I come back? No. There are plenty of great breakfast places in Manhattan and this place ranks incredibly low on my list.' u"I've been here many times. Everything is amazing. You better make a reservation or starve while you wait for a table." u"Outstanding food that is always locally sourced. Quaint atmosphere great service and reasonably priced. My only complaint were the cocktails. I ordered the earl grey which was just OK. Otherwise great little spot. I would go again and probably just order wine. Now that I think about it that's all everyone else was drinking." u'Decor/environment: Pretty small - good to make a reservation. Fits maybe 20 people. Dark rustic intimate upscale but still feels relaxed - not fancy in a stuffy way. They have fun chicken statues on the chandeliers!\n\nService: Great. The waiter was so friendly helpful and put everyone in good spirits.\n\nFood: The food rotates based on what\'s in season because it\'s farm to table.\nStuffed chicken breast: Juicy and well-cooked with tasty stuffing made with blue cheese. It sat on top of kale that was cooked with some pieces of bacon/prosciutto. Most of the mains are literally just one main but this entree came with greens which made it feel more like a complete dish in my eyes.\nMeatloaf: This is what I mean by just one main - the meatloaf comes as literally just meatloaf no sides of mashed potato or greens with it. The meatloaf was stuffed with cheese and I think apple and I loved the stuffing! The meatloaf tasted good and fresh but wasn\'t super stand out to me.\n\nSides: The veggie sides are ordered separately from the main dish. They come in super small little mini skillet dishes. They are delicious but it is pretty small.\nCauliflower: AMAZING. How does one make cauliflower this delicious! It tasted so umami and deep in flavor. The "farmesan" cheese was delicious and I definitely scraped up the bits that were burned to the mini skillet.\n\nOverall this place has top-notch food service and atmosphere. I admire their values and commitment to farm to table! The portions are smaller and prices a little higher than what I expected but you\'re paying to help sustainable practices.'],0.5499,0.173,0.827,0.0
122.Hell’s Kitchen,[u"Yes yes yes. As a picky vegetarian (on a recent Mexican food kick) that loves to dine out I am recommending the crispy brussel sprout tacos that I took a chance ordering. ($9) The taco was lined with a cashew 'salsa' pur\xe9e and a slightly spicy avocado dip was served on the side. \n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say I've thought about that dish since I had it and I will definitely be returning! (And I don't like to repeat restaurants because there's so many in NYC!) I only wish the dish was slightly bigger so I could enjoy more of it! My friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and was (almost) as satisfied as I was. The chips & salsa to start were a great introduction to the delicious dishes. Highly recommend the frozen margaritas ($12) - I had the guava and oh my \n\nOur waiter was so friendly and the atmosphere is just how I like it - dim lighting cool decor & fun people." u"I went here for my birthday dinner.\nYou get free chips and watered down salsa while you wait for your food.\nThe food was good and I'm not even a huge Mexican food person.\nI ordered the steak fajitas nothing out of the ordinary from any other restaurant though. Maybe a little better than Apple bees. Steak was a little rough but I loved the amount of veggies you got with them.\nMy friend ordered the chicken burrito and he absolutely loved it. He ate everything on his plate.\n\nThe biggest reason I gave this place a 4/5 is because our waitress was slacking and didn't have the best attitude.\nNot sure if I'd return." u"Food was good. Drinks were okay. Service was nice. Love the vibe! \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Friday around 6pm and was told there would be a 30 minute wait. Happy hour was only available at the bar and it was packed. We decided to wait for a table. The place is dark very spacious with loud music. \n\nI had a margarita which was okay. My friend had paloma which came in a really cute can (picture). For food we ordered guacamole to start which came in a really small cup but tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were salted. I had trio of tacos (mahi mahi brussel sprout short rib). They came really small and tasted good but not the best. The mahi mahi and short rib was flavorful but not as tender as I liked. I highly recommend the brussel sprout taco if you like it. I enjoyed every bite of that veggie goodness. The rice and beans that came with my entree was boring and bland. I tried my friend's steak which was also good but a little too chewy for me. \n\nOur server was very nice and made sure everything we ordered was exactly how we wanted. The only thing was that the service was a bit slow maybe cause it was busy. The bill came about $40 a person which is good for hell's kitchen. I would return." u'Cozy dim lit spot. Tacos were delicious and drinks were good. Tried all the fish tacos and mezcal margarita definitely one of the best in the city. Waiter was very friendly and helpful.' u'Food is good especially the pineapple guacamole. Met my friends here for happy hour and the vibe is really chill and it felt like a great place to catch up with friends. Not sure how new this place is but I wish it were here when I used to work in the area.' u'Came here on a busy Friday night. Service was great food was extremely filling and the atmosphere was great. We had chicken nachos and chicken tacos in addition to a round of margaritas which were huge. We will definitely be back.' u"I recently moved into the area and came here with my roommates to celebrate moving to hell's kitchen (fitting restaurant name). The ambiance of this place is super cool - it's a little dark but in the best kind of way (cozy and rustic). \n\nThe drinks menu was abundant and you could get three flights of margaritas of any flavor for only $15! The food was also really delicious - I opted for the grilled shrimp quesadillas my roommates got a kale chicken salad and the chilaquiles. All three dishes were delicious and portion sizes were massive (all of us packed our food and were able to eat it for a second meal). Overall a really great place could definitely see myself coming back for drinks/happy hour." u"I have been here several times. I have brought friends here and the drinks and food never disappoint me. \n\nI usually get a margarita and the quesadillas. The quesadillas don't look like the tradition triangle quesadillas. In fact they come to you in square form. It is a meal that you should eat with a fork. If I could I would eat one of those every day! Fantastic. \n\nThey also have a margarita flight. I couldn't finish it! LOL\n\nI also had a great server who was very attentive. The only problem I had with her is that when it came to paying my bill it took forever for her to come back to my table. \n\nOverall the couple of times I have been to this restaurant have been enjoyable. I would return and bring friends." u"This review is based on the customer service received at this establishment because my friend and I decided not to eat here in the end. . .When we first walked in there was no one to greet/seat us we asked one of the cooks who came out and he pointed us to the person at the door (we thought he was a customer leaving he should have greeted us). Then we said hi to him and told him everyone looks like customers and since no one greeted us we were going to seat ourselves he didn't saying anything much after that he just asked how many people and I told him two. He took us to our seats and we preferred a booth so asked if we could get a booth seating the host turned his back to us and as he was walking away said No it's reserved. My friend and I just felt uncomfortable because the host was rude from the start literally we looked at each other and were like nope and ended up leaving to another Mexican eatery across the street. This review is just based on customer service as that makes a difference from the bad service received from the start we decided to not even spend our money or patronize this business. . .And were visiting from another state so we won't be back." u"A friend and I went to Hell's Kitchen and while there are a bunch of Mexican restaurants clustered in this area this one is the most upscale and tasty.\n\nThe vibe is rather intimate and a lot of people here seem to be on dates. It's pretty dark in here especially in the back.\n\nThere was a little bit of a wait when we arrived but the front area is all bar area and it's a great spot to people watch. You can also eat at the bar.\n\nWe started with the guacamole trio which came out very fast. The chips are very good. I opted for the fajitas which was a very large portion but it only came with three tortillas. I guess I could've asked for more but that seems a little small in number.\n\nOverall it wasn't too expensive here and it's a better option than the other Mexican restaurants on 9th Avenue." u'The food was amazing service was very quick and real good one and ambiance was also nice and clean. I would definitely recommend this place.' u"What an awesome place\n\nAt first I was not super pressed to visit because I thought it would be filled with dramatic HK types but I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThis is a great place to pick up some apps and more importantly drinks. The restaurant offers a great mix of margaritas. Unfortunately I am a bit of a bore when it comes to margaritas because I am a tequila + lime juice kind of guy. \n\nIn addition to the drinks there are many yummy things to get to eat. It's about 12 bucks for two mini tacos but they are pilled high. Plus they have interesting and innovative tacos like a cheeseburger taco. *There were others but I may have forgotten them because of all the tequila.* I went for the braised rib tacos which were fabulous. There was a little bit of miscommunication and it took a while to receive our food about 45+ minutes for two tacos and a quesadilla. However Ryan the bartender gave us an order of nachos and a round of shots for our wait. He was great and made sure our drinks were full. \n\nI definitely will be back to try some of the other tacos. \n\nTip: it may be a bit of a wait to get a table on a Friday night if you do not have reservations." u"We went to Hell's Kitchen right at 5pm when they opened on a Sunday and were seated without reservations.  We had a show just down the street and it was recommended by a local I can see why!  \n\nWe started out with drinks (which I was told were delicious and strong) and I have a great mocktail.  The chips and guacamole were addicting.  I had to slow myself down to save room for dinner.  For dinner we did taco trio's which you can pick and choose from their vast taco menu.  I chose two and topped it off with a shrimp taco at our waiter's recommendation.  OMG THAT TACO.  If I go back I will be getting 3 shrimp tacos.  The shrimp were huge and the way they dressed it was beyond delicious.\n\nThe finishing touch to this experience was the service.  I wish I would have caught our waiters name because he was amazing (and I wish we could be best friends).  He was attentive personable and really made it a great dining experience.  Judging from the interactions at the bar he was not alone in his great customer service.\n\nI highly recommend Hell's Kitchen to anyone looking for a great meal in NYC." u"This place was way way wayyy too dark. I don't know if they were trying to create a dungeon setting or if a bunch of lights blew out at the same time or what but I couldn't read the menu. I couldn't even read the expressions on my friend's face.\n\nThe nachos were really good though and quesadilla wasn't bad." u"This place was cool. They have complimentary chips and salsa and we also had an amazing appetizer. I can't remember what it's called but it was the shrimp sweet plantain and avocado appetizer. My friend and I couldn't stop talking about how good it was though so simple. Then we got the chicken burrito and sizzling chicken fajitas. We both also agreed that our entrees were just okay. It lacked some flavor. It seemed it was missing that umph. Especially the rice. I love rice but their rice just didn't do it for me. However putting everything together in the tortilla made it decent enough." u"Great place in Hell's Kitchen went here for tacos after reading some reviews and lead me in the right direction. Got the mahi tacos and brussel sprout tacos and both were delicious. Smaller but they make up for it in taste. The staff was also very helpful in suggestions and attentive in service. They also offer a good drink selection while making off menu drinks just as well. Have to head back to try more of the menu" u'Immediately I was impressed by the air quality of this unexpectedly dark and cavernous "Mexican Restaurant." Everything about this place is delightfully drowning--the music the lighting the emotionally-muted waiters. \n\nService was efficient--fast and to-the-point. I ordered the Devil\'s Nightcap which tasted too strong to be delicious on its own but complemented the heavy shrimp quesadillas I was eating quite well. More about the quesadilla: each bite was a party in my mouth--cheesy crunchy gooey goodness. The chips we ordered were precisely what you\'d expect from any Mexican Restaurant: hearty and home-made tasting.\n\nTo sum it up: Hell\'s Kitchen is more like Heaven\'s Kitchen for cheese-lovers (order the quesadillas). The powerful central AC also departs from the restaurant\'s name. The only thing diabolical about this joint is probably the strength of the drinks.' u"Came here on a work trip and was impressed with the tacos- they had a few interesting ones so I naturally had to try the Brussel sprouts Taco which was amazing! They sprouts were so crispy; I never expected to get that in a Taco and have it taste as good as it did. The fish and carne Asada Taco were also pretty good. The garnishes in the tacos tastes fresh and were not too over powering . \n\nSalsa and chips were served to us which were fine. I also got rice and beans with mine but was too full to eat it. \n\nDrink wise I really wanted to try the grapefruit margarita but went with a spicier one. It was good but man was it spicy and the rim\nMade it really hot!\n\nI would definitely come back here again if I'm twin. They had other non Taco Mexican dishes  along with burritos and burrito bowls- i would go for that next!" u'Me and my bf walked in with no reservation on a Friday night. After 15 minutes we were accommodated. The food was great the atmosphere is very outgoing they have pretty good music. The best part  was our waiter Seth he was awesome super attentive.' u'Upon arrival the host was very helpful he put our name on the list and told us he\'d call us when our table is available-perfect. The restaurant itself is very very dark which is kind of romantic but questionable? The booth that we sat at was covered with dust hence the questionable feeling about the dark atmosphere. Our party of four ordered tacos and nachos with margaritas- everything came out pretty quickly. My tacos were actually pretty good I got the snapper fish tacos. The portion is really small you only get two tacos and nothing else with your meal... not bad for 12 bucks I guess? As I finished up my second taco I noticed a hair in my food yuck! Another person in our party also found a hair in their margarita. disgusting! We asked to speak to the manager because our waiter was super nice and we didn\'t want him to feel like it was his fault. The manager stopped by and apologized profusely and offered us four shots and took the items off the bill. As we left the restaurant the manager sneered at us with other guests at the restaurant saying "Great! Leave already!" Quite embarrassing... we probably won\'t be going there again.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
32.Blue Fin,[u"It was BOOM-tastic! \nFood came out super fast. Lobster mashed potatoes and Papas Bravas were amazing along with the best sushi that we had so far. \nI would definitely recommend this location if you're in NY looking for some sushi and a prime spot." u"Stopped in after a show for a quick bite. There's not much in Time Square that isn't crowded so when we were able to get right in we were excited. The hostess took us up stairs and seated us in a cozy booth. \n\nMy daughter always takes over ordering so I let her do her thing. We only wanted appetizers since it was late. She ordered the lobster and shrimp spring rolls they crispy and tasty but not the best. We then had shrimp dumplings in a broth that was good. We then had their truffle sushi roll with the fish on top instead inside the sushi was not my favorite. Still hungry we ordered the shrimp at $8.00 a piece we had three! \n\nBlue Fin is located in the W Hotel right in Time Square. The service was good our waiter was great. Food could of been better but still enjoyed ourselves." u'It\'s surprising how I had never noticed this restaurant until the Restaurant Week. Came here for a week-day lunch with friends and loved it! We ordered the "Slow braised pork belly bao bun" for appetizers and the salmon for main course. The pork buns were one of the best I\'ve had - this coming from someone who has to order pork buns if it\'s on the menu. Crispy char siu with lettuce and a spicy sauce wrapped in super soft buns are to die for!\n\nThe "cedar plank faroe island salmon" was well done like I had asked for and came with charred corn salad. The burnt crispy later of salmon conjured up by the chef makes it worth the price. It\'s not very often that you like the salad that comes with salmon as much as the salmon! The chef made that happen here.\n\nThen came the beautifully decorated desserts. You\'ve got 2 options -  1. Triple Chocolate cheesecake with ice-cream  2. Summer stone fruit upside down cake. Get the second one yes definitely get the second one! It\'s ridiculously delicious a no-brainer.\n\nThe server was extremely courteous ambience was fancy but not overwhelming. They got my friends\' kid a drawing kit and made sure she was comfortably seated. It\'s right next to the red stairs are Times Square so a great location. Made the entire experience memorable!' u'Came here before I saw a bronx tale with my wife. We arrived at 610 and our show was 7. The waiter was awesome and was weary of the time for us. I order the Montauk calamari which was just the best I ever had. Not fried and tasty. My wife got the jade wontons and the lobster rolls. Those were both ok.to good to me. Like a 6 out of ten. The lobster roll was like any typical spring roll. Very fast service and great decor.' u'Here for restaurant week! The only thing better than our food was our excellent waiter DANIEL! \nI have had BAO Through out the city and this for sure makes my top 3 spots for bao. Sushi was excellent. Salmon had a fun taste side and was cooked perfectly. Both dessert options were delicious although we liked the chocolate cheesecake a tad more! Deff a great spot for rest week lunch!!!' u'Definitely lived up to my expectations! The food exceeded my expectations! Started with the butternut squash lobster bisque the Times Square sushi roll and some hand picked oysters. The ribeye was my dinner choice and I love that it came on a cutting board. The meat was seasoned and cooked just right for me. Did not save room for desert. The table is the reason for 4 stars. It was in the middle of the floor and the waiters and patrons kept walking in between mines and the one behind me. This is a high traffic location and a lot of folks must dine here before the shows. However for a two top I was struggling for space with all the food we ordered and constantly distracted by the passers by who were a little close for comfort. Other than that loved it!' u'Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend before heading to a show around the corner. The service and atmosphere were both really great! The food was also good but definitely on the pricey side. \n\nWe got the edamame and lobster mashed potatoes (they were fantastic!!) to start. Still cant stop thinking about them they had meaty chunks of lobster and it was great! We also got 2 rolls and the fish was fresh and tasted amazing. We were both very full at the end of the meal.' u"So after writing the review David the Manager contacted my sister who made the reservation at 8/9 AM! Now if that's not AMAZING service I'm not sure what is. My sisters and I are still figuring out how David managed to get her contact information through my Yelp review! Pretty sure David could be a superhero. \n\nDavid welcomed her back along with a guest since the service was subpar the first time. Since I work just 2 blocks away my sister gave me her invitation and I brought one of my coworkers along with me. \n\n1 word. EXCEPTIONAL. We were seated right away and boy did the service change. No more waiting 25 minutes for water! Our glasses were always filled and David even introduced himself to me and my coworker. The service was absolutely wonderful!\n\nI ordered the Chirashi bowl and my coworker had the Salmon burger. This time the food was not mediocre at all. It was extremely fresh and delicious and my favorite part was the eel. I NEVER EVER liked eel before out of the thousand times I've tried it... but Blue Fin is the FIRST and ONLY place I will keep going back for the eel! \n\nMy coworker also enjoyed her salmon burger and was very happy with her choice. \n\nDavid also surprised us with my favorite dessert which was the upside down cake and surprised my coworker with an extravagant fruit platter!\n\nEvery place deserves a second change and I can hands down say this place has won me over by listening to my review and going out of their way to make the experience more enjoyable. Thank you again David and Blue Fin I'll be coming back and bringing my other coworkers because of the wonderful experience I had!" u'My wife and I came to NYC for our 5yr anniversary. Decided we wanted to check out blue fin since it was close to our hotel. I would never come back. The food was really good. We had the beet and goat cheese appetizer and the seafood spring rolls. The sushi was good as well. \nThe problem was with the service we had. It was horrible. We were only offered water to drink. I had to ask if there was coke or iced tea available. Once we got our drinks and drank them we were never offered a re-fill. My glass at empty for more than half of the time we were there. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  If I am going to spend this kind of $$$ on a meal I would expect more... quite disappointing.' u'My friend from Dallas wanted to have dinner here.  He loves Broadway shows.\n"It\'s gonna be pricey." He warned.\nIt still didn\'t prepare me for $15 rolls and $15 for a 2 piece sushi order entrees starting around $29 and wines starting at $11.  I think the burger was $22 and I don\'t think it came with fries. \n\nThe place felt a bit tony for sure - dimly lit with large booths and loungey table seating.  It almost had a hotel feel which makes sense for the Times Square tourist patrons looking for a New York feel.\n\nTourist New York or Dallas.  \n\n"I had a 2 rolls the other night for $16 which is good for New York." My friend oofed.\n"That\'s not really New York." I replied.  \n"You just have to know where to go."\n\nMy friend was trying to have a romantic date with another mutual friend who wasn\'t interested and asked me to crash. \n\nAwkward.  \n\nI wasn\'t hungry but went for one of the cheapest glasses of wine a Cabernet rose from France.  When I tried to order it I had to show the waiter which exact one on the menu.\n"It\'s $21?"\n"God I hope not." I exhaled.\n"The $11 one." I pointed to it on the menu.\nGlasses averaged around $16.  My advice would to be very clear on prices here as the mood and server exchanges beg for being spendy.  \n\nMy friends ordered edamame with a spicy soy sauce glaze and peanuts.  I think it was $12.   My friends dinners looked good if a little ordinary.  Their dishes sea bass and something else kind of looked like a nice meal out for a 40 year old who likes things safe.   Who likes to eat at fancy feeling hotel restaurants. \n\nMy wine was really very good and the ambiance was actually really intimate and nice.   I will definitely come back here for a drink. \n\nTo get into the place I entered a lobby right off Times Square into a lower level dining area that was completely empty.   It was actually hard to believe the upstairs area had such a cool vibe sexy quiet and secretive.  \n\nGo for the bar if you\'re in the area and go upstairs.' u"Perched on the second floor of the W Hotel in Times Square area this beautifully run restaurant is an lovely refuge in a noisy part of town. For our two visits to NY in the past two years we've enjoyed four meals here two of them brunch with others (the most amazing eggs benedict with smoked salmon) the other two have been dinners with fresh and deliciously prepared fresh seafood. For us it's a destination restaurant... and the service is attentive and friendly. \nIn addition I have to mention the chairs as I have bad joint issues and am often uncomfortable but not here they're magical can spend a whole evening without pain. Lovely place to kick back enjoy some wine and wonderful food and toast a special occasion!" u"The lobster mashed potatoes were delicious and the amount of edamame that comes with the appetizer was very generous. The spicy king crab roll was particularly good and the upstairs atmosphere mostly allows you to forget that you're in Times Square." u'No hand rolls \nSmall portions on Chirasi bowl\nTea was late - came after the food \nNo Blue Fin???' u"If you have a lot of time to waste enjoy lackluster service expensive food but great food please come here.  Each time I come here the service gets worse and worse.  I'll have to stop coming here.  The people at the desk don't know their products or their demographic.  I asked 4 different people about the menu and received 4 different answers 3 of which I knew to be wrong.  I'm paying to eat and drink here fyi.  Put in my small order for two and didn't get order until 30 minutes later.  The food is great but the service is awful.  And it doesn't matter if it's crowded or empty it's the same story.  It's so tragic because the food is wonderful I love it.  The service sucks and no one cares." u'I came here with business colleagues and we ordered quite a bit of food - apps sushi and rolls.  Overall the service and food were very good.  But the big issue I have is if I were to pay for it myself I would think twice about coming here.  I realize it\'s NY and Times Square; but wow I was surprised at the cost (and I use to live in the city).  So as my motto goes "good food for a good price" my rating reflects this thought.' u"We enjoyed our stay at the W Hotel and had to try out this place. I must say I was not disappointed! The menu is pricey but it is New York we only live once so we need to indulge sometimes! Food.and service was spectacular I will definitely go back next time I'm in New York!" u'Great location for pre and post Broadway or just a get together  menu selection is enough to satisfy any taste bud. Service was attentive our server Stan took care of every detail host David is friendly and professional. First but not last time here' u'Had breakfast here while staying at the W hotel.  Really nice set up waiter service was really good.  Had 3 bagels with creme cheese 2 coffees and 1 orange juice..paid $52!!  A little pricey but yes I know we are in NYC.' u'The breakfast here is amazing. Chorizo and eggs hands down is so good and they give you plenty. Its worth the price. It also comes with this avocado creme fresh which is so good when you mix it.' u"Came in for a celebratory lunch with a friend. Made reservations for 1:30 and the hosts welcomed us by name and were very professional. Although the restaurant didn't seem particularly busy our waitress was very patient with us while we were briefly catching up before ordering. They had a lovely restaurant week lunch special for $29 however the Chirashi bowl just seemed more appealing to me so that's what I went with. The Chirashi bowl was filled with a large portion of really fresh sashimi and the sushi rice was prepared perfectly. My friend ordered the grilled Montauk calamari which came with about 5 small whole squid pieces and a delicious grain cauliflower and greens salad. \n\nWe ordered the king crab sushi for an appetizer. 6 pieces for $19. The Sushi felt overpriced but the quality was great. We didn't have enough room left to enjoy dessert but the chocolate cheesecake with cherries that I saw on other tables (a part of the Restaurant week lunch) looked phenomenal."],0.2732,0.07,0.93,0.0
208.Lucky Star Cafe,[u'Very delicious breakfast and great prices too! Quick in and out place and you get a lot of food for your money. We ordered a number 2 and 3 breakfast special (I forgot to take a picture before the review).' u'Ordered delivery at 11:24 (24 hour delivery) they said it would be less than an hour. Here it is 12:47 and still no food So I contact them and they said they needed to cancel the order due to not enough drivers. I suspect it was because I only ordered the minimum amount I am starving in my hotel that has no room service been waiting for an hour and a half to be told its not coming. Terrible customer service.' u"This review is based on one visit only. I was starving and frustrated that I couldn't find any gluten free food around the area for a quick lunch. I asked the staff if they had anything that could be made GF (such as eggs). They gave me an attitude. Not friendly. Not accommodating in any way. My husband ordered the pastrami on rye to go. Not impressed at all with his sandwich. It was pretty mediocre. Thankfully I found The Counter a few blocks away and I was able to eat a good lunch :)" u"My go to breakfast place at the moment because they're cheap and quick on deliveries. I've been craving traditional breakfast items lately such as french toast omelettes and grilled cheese (more of a lunch item I guess) and this place does it all. \n\nThe Challah French toast was pretty standard and was pretty filling too! It comes with 4 pieces I believe and some of them are slightly coated in frosting. I had to dip it in a lot of syrup for flavor so I wish it had more natural sweetness. Or even a bit of frosting or powdered sugar would make this dish even yummier. \n\nI tried their breakfast sets too and think they're just okay. The steak egg cheese and home fries aren't too memorable. I would get one of their sandwiches instead. \n\nI tried the grilled cheese jalape\xf1o popper today and I really liked it. The way the cream cheese goes with the entire sandwich was really yummy. Also the French fries are great!!" u"The food tasted ok. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and that's exactly what I got. Nothing really special. I ordered a burger with bacon and cheese. The burger was pretty good but needed salt. All in all with a second visit and I will update my review. My order was delivered and I didn't realize the place was a bit aways from where I was located. It was nice that the delivery was actually pretty quick." u'Found them on Yelp and decided to try it. Asked if it was cash only because I saw a sign that said "ATM Inside" as I walked in. They said no but there was a $10 minimum charge for credit cards. I asked for a chicken sandwich which was listed at $7.99 and asked what else I should get with it. They suggested I add fries and he referred to the sign which said $9.99. I asked if that was enough assuming I was a penny short. He said it was fine. Then came time to ring me up and he rung me up for $11.99 + tax. I said "I thought the price was $9.99" and he said "That\'s only at lunch." I read the menu carefully and saw nothing that noted the posted prices were only at lunch. \n\nI strongly believe that this restaurant is taking advantage of people by charging extra when they think they can get away with it. It was 2:30AM and I bet they thought I had been drinking and they could get away with it. I don\'t want to support a business with these kind of ethics. I would give them a pass if the food was out of this world but it was nothing to write home about.' u'Visiting from Chicago and decided to stop for a quick bite. The owner who was there by himself was very nice and accommodating. We opted for burgers and they were amazing!!' u'Really god sandwiches. There burgers and fries are great. Skip Shake Shack these are cheaper and just as tasty with no long lines.' u"Was in town for business. I was really craving a great breakfast sandwich. I found this spot on yelp and it was around the corner from my hotel. I walked around the corner early Sunday morning and ordered a hand egg and cheese on a kaiser roll. It was good. Not excellent. The sandwich had two eggs on it but could have used a little more cheese and ham. The roll was tasty. They had lots of interesting looking stuff on display such as other sandwiches and salads etc. The guys weren't overly friendly but service was quick and efficient. I would definitely grab another sandwich next time I'm on town." u'We ran into this little hole in the wall by accident. We were actually looking for another restaurant; and we were SO GLAD we did!! We went there every single morning. We found it had very healthy breakfasts for my husband and I but had delicious regular food for our children. They are open 24/7(which we did not know til the last day). Prices are SO reasonable!! We will definitely be going there daily on our next trip to NYC!!' u'Great food awesome staff very friendly and willing to accommodate with a smile. We were there after breakfast hours but did not have any problems making what we wanted. I would go back.' u'It was about 6am and I was hungry and landed in NY about an hour prior.  I pulled out my trusty yelp app and this was the only place that was open and had decent ratings.  \n\nThis little(albeit a little ghetto) sandwich shop is a solid 4.  The cashier woman was extremely friendly.  I decided to test the shop by ordering a ruben at 6 in the morning the cook was a little confused at my decision but they decided to humor me.  The ruben was extremely tasty.  Packed with meat crisp bread hot piping cheese and a tangy dressing.  The only downside was it was a little bit on the greasy side but I can overlook that.  There were a good amount of customers that flew through.\n\nThe size of the place might put you off but give it a try it is a great place to pick up a sandwich or a small breakfast combination to start off your day.' u"In the area on business I stumbled on Lucky Star looking for a quick lunch. Little did I know I'd have the best cheesesteak I'd have in my lifetime. The well mannered and attentive service was just as great. Quite small & I hate the seating. Other than that I love!! Please try the philly lunch special." u'A good option for something quick and cheap in the theatre district. Small inside not meant for a large number of dine-in guests. We had the gyro and cheeseburger both satisfied.' u'Yum! I just ordered delivery from here and it was exactly what I was looking for. The totally delivery time was a little longer than promised (ended up being around an hour) but the delivery guy was really nice and the food was still hot when I got it. I got the Brooklyn grilled cheese and loved it. Nice and crispy but not burnt or too over done. Lots of mustard and cheese. Fries were delicious as well and nice and crispy. Will definitely be ordering from here again and look forward to trying some more things on the menu.' u"Honestly I didn't know much about it but decided to order delivery from here. Saw that had a great selection of steak sandwiches so I tried the steak sandwich with mozzarella and sauce on garlic bread. I added onions to it and got it with fries. All of it was great. I will definitely be ordering from here again. There are a lot of different options so I will be mixing things up for sure. Hope it sticks around." u"Ok so from the outside if doesn't look like much but I was starving after a night out with my friends and I got a turkey and ham sandwich on multigrain/oat wheat bread. (Huge plus in my opinion as most late night deli places only have white bread). \n\nWould've given 5 stars but he gave me spicy mustard instead of regular yellow mustard but it was still delicious! Fresh lettuce tomato and  cold cuts! If you're in the area and need a quick bite I'd definitely recommend!! Enjoy!" u'Hi Max\n\nI kept it simple with an egg bacon & cheddar on a bagel. My daughters had the same. My husband said that his Cuban sandwich was great!' u'Great for a fast cheap breakfast in the Times Square area! Good fresh food and large portions. No frills ambiance.' u"Best fries!!!!! Wasn't even hungry and was snacking on fiance's order from Lucky Star Cafe. I will for sure order myself next time!"],0.3802,0.302,0.698,0.0
204.Radiance Tea House and Books,[u"Quaint tea house in midtown. It is a bit pricey so might not be the place you'd want to come for lunch but definitely recommend if you like tea. The atmosphere is 5-stars: cozy (but not cramped) soft-lighting and well decorated. We ordered a jasmine tea and two oolongs and that was plenty for 5 people. I also tried the soup dumplings and they were delicious.\n\nThe tea here may seem expensive but it is worth it. I have had tea at many many tea houses in NYC and I can say that this place is among the best. The teas you order here will be top notch and the servers will ensure that they are prepared in the best way.\n\nWill definitely return here." u"Found this near by spot on yelp and decided to give it a try. Quaint and pleasant. I had shrimp wanton soup and teriyaki chicken rice bowl(lunch special). Soup was piping hot so took a while before I could bite into a wanton. Well worth the wait it was the most delicious I could every remember having. I ate every piece and enjoyed every drop. The rice bowl arrived and I'd figure to enjoy half and take the rest home. But over the next half hour I managed the chopsticks and finished every little. Ok so I had dinner at lunchtime.\nWell the next day my bride of 42 years arrived in town and I suggested going to Radiance. I'm not a huge tea fan but my wife is and they must have over fifty choices. She chose to have a pot of the tangerine white and enjoyed it so much that she bought a tin to take home. She ordered the sweet and sour soup that she acknowledged was the best she'd ever had and a beef dish that neither one of us could remember the name of. Needless to say no take home container was required.\nThis is definitely a regular spot going forward." u"Radiance Tea House was a terrible disappointment: the teas were fairly run-of-the mill over-priced westernized and inauthentic and the bento boxes and dumplings were uninspiring. As a fan of The Infatuation's recommendations I was crestfallen.\n\nThe ambiance is adorable (albeit entirely geared towards western tastes) but if I craved frozen dumplings I would make a beeline for a grocery store." u"Stopped by here on a Saturday evening for tea and a bite to eat with a friend. \n\nIt was quite empty when arrived with plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. The ambiance was great for an intimate dinner date and the decor definitely suited its name with tea sets and books lining the walls.\n\nI ordered the Lychee Lady to start which was an iced black tea with Lychee syrup. So refreshing and delicious! We shared the soupy pork dumplings which were like mini xiao long bao. They were a good appetizer but not very filling with only 5 bites per order. I also got the Dan-dan noodles which were just noodles with minced beef and scallions in a chili sauce. The description sounded like it came with more beef and veggies so I was slightly disappointed but it was still a tasty side dish. \n\nFor dessert we split the mochi ice cream platter which came with green tea red bean and black sesame. The green tea and black sesame were good but the red bean just tasted like sugar to me.\n\nOverall the restaurant was lovely and cozy the food was good but the service was terrible! We could not get our waitress' attention and they were very inattentive when we wanted to order ran out of drinks or needed the bill. Even though it was pretty empty and there were several servers standing around and chatting together.\n\nI would come back for tea and dessert but dinner was such a hassle and took too long to enjoy the experience." u"I hesitate to give a great review because it would attract yelpers and non-yelpers alike to check it out.  But then that's why we all turn to Yelp!  After a beautiful afternoon strolling through the Heather Garden in Fort Tryon Park and catching up with an old friend she suggested come down to Midtown to refresh our souls.\n\nWalking in the entrance reminded me a little of the entrance to Le Pain Quotidien on Madison and 85th except with an Asian theme.  Once at top of stairs you find an open space with many 2-4 top seating.  All with traditional straight backed wooden chairs.  Space is calm and roomy.  Let's meditate for a moment. \n\nOnce seated I noticed the bookstore area which reminds me of typical bookstores in Chinatown with books laid out on a table.  I was there for some refreshments and I happily looked over the menu.  First up was deciding on a drink.  A refreshing mint iced tea hit the spot.  It came out with a 1 cm thick froth top topped by a sprig of fresh mint.  Almost looked like beer except the curly Q plastic straw was out of place.  The flavor was perfect.  My friends opted for iced chai latte and traditional hot tea.  Yes we had a traditionalist.  He had to have his hot tea. \n\nWe paired these drinks with an order of dumplings mochi platter and butter cookies.  All were delicious." u"I was so happy to find a tea house in Midtown! The facade is quite subtle so I was really surprised to stumble upon Radiance on my way home from work.\n\nThe decor inside is really simplistic with shelves full of books and tea pots/cups. It's a great place to go for some afternoon tea and relaxation without all of the bustle of the surrounding area. \n\nI've come here a few times and tried both the food and tea. \n- Earl Grey Latte: You can request this with a non-dairy alternative. I thought this was a really good latte. The flavor was strong but not overwhelming. The latte was creamy and had a nice hint of sweetness to it. \n- Jasmine Pearls: This Jasmine tea was solid. They provide you with the leaves and strainer so that you can brew to your liking. There is enough tea for two. \n- Dan-Dan Noodle: I really appreciated the texture of these noodles. They were soft but still easy to eat. The sauce isn't the spiciest I've had but it's good for those who enjoy dan-dan more mild. \n- Soupy Pork Steamed Dumplings: These were pretty standard. They reminded me a bit of miniature xiaolongbaos. \n\nService is a bit slow but it matches the super calm atmosphere. Overall a great place to relax over afternoon tea." u'Since leaving this review I have returned multiple times and have tried their hot teas larger plates and salads. This place still holds a special place in my heart. Trust me and get the pork dumplings.\n\nCatching up with an old friend? Meeting with your paramour? This is the place.' u'The food is not very fresh. We ordered beef ribs with black pepper sauce the broccolis inside are cold. The veggies in mixed seafood with vegetables are not fresh neither. The tea is plain as well. Dongpo pork is too salty.\nNot really a fan of this restaurant.' u"Cute ambiance but food is rather bland. \n\nMy coworker and I had lunch here we ordered the braised pork noodle from the lunch special menu soup dumplings and a pork bun. \n\nBraised beef soup noodles-We both wanted to enjoy this since it felt like 24 f outside but were disappointed. broth was flavorless and noodles tasted watery. \n\nPork bun- tasted okay nothing special.  I've had better in Chinatown. \n\nSoup dumplings - of the items with the most flavor of all the things we ordered. This was definitely our favorite. This is how the broth for the braised beef soup noodle should have tasted. \n\nService was okay.\n\nCome for the environment tea selection and dumplings that's it!" u"Hi all I'm Asian and grew up most of my life in Asia and yes I do have more than 20 different kinds of tea in my house. That being said I think you can trust me on my verdict that this place is far from authentic. The assorted cheesecake we had was freshly out of the freezer as it came half frozen with ice covering parts of it. When it comes to tea? Don't even mention it. But if you don't really care about having authentic tea and have no expectations about their drinks in terms of matching quality and price just enjoy and have a good time chatting with your friends." u'Got the beef noodle soup which I loved previously and it was $19 for lunch. The catch is it comes with chicken broth not traditional Taiwanese braised beef noodle soup which is dark brown with anise spices and pickled vegetable-y goodness.\n\nUnfortunately given the price and declining quality not much good to say about this place.' u"After meaning to come here for awhile I was finally able to drag the SO to Radiance for dinner. I'm so glad I did because the food was exactly what I needed: flavorful and distinctly Chinese but not too oily.\n\nWe ordered the cold chicken chili noodles Szechuan beef with tofu and eggplant with chili. All 3 dishes were amazing. The cold chicken chili noodles are not to be skipped and are a great starter. The Szechuan beef had hints of Szechuan peppercorn spice without being intolerable. The tofu was soft and silky. Finally the eggplant was perfectly steamed and the chili / garlic topping added great flavor.         \n\nI will definitely be back! Next time I hope to try out some of the teas." u"BANG! #MerlinFiiive and #AZNEXCELLENCE awards in the same review. Let me explain.\n\nCoffee shops in NYC are pretty miserable for a lot of reasons: too crowded; no bathroom; no plug; cramped quarters; and so on. Take it from a guy who has paced around Clinton Hill nervously looking for a place to go to the bathroom after a one hour subway ride downing two bottles of water. \n\nRadiance Tea is like some weird otherworldly escape zone where none of these problems is present. There's a 20-page book of exotic teas a full-slate food menu ample space and a chillaxed atmosphere (relax+chill verb fusion) that encourages you to take your time achieve mindfulness (or whatever) and just enjoy yourself. If you're in the mood for a dim sum hit -- and what kid from the 626 isn't? -- there are some staples here though it won't beat what's downtown. \n\nI kind of don't want to write another review of this for fear of spoiling the secret. On the other hand I want readers to avoid the awful Russian Tea Room and integrity to MC3 readers wins out." u'One if my favorite places in the city for eating authentic Chinese food. The atmosphere is soothing and calming. Many of the dishes are also healthy and their tea makes a great pairing with all the dishes. I also love the decoration which gives off a wonderful cultural flare.' u"Great service! Our server was so kind and gave us honest recommendations (leading us away from the American-favorites traps). We were looking for the most authentic dishes Radiance Tea House had and he recommended the braised pork belly silky tofu with black bean chili sauce and boy choy. Pork belly was standard and oily tofu was good but not great. Boy choy can never be bad. While the dishes weren't amazing they were authentic. More expensive than Chinatown but much less oil and very very good service." u'I came on a weekday around 12 and got seated right away. Ordered the seafood soup and some kind of vege and both were good. The soup was a little too salty but great with rice. Overall this is a pretty decent restaurant.' u'Came here for tea because it was pretty cold out side and we needed to rest from walking all day. \n\nService was great! Tea was delicious! Price was ehhhhh but it was a really nice and relaxing spot before dinner or just to talk and catch up.' u"I came here for dinner with party of 7 after making reservations ahead of time. When we showed up they said no reservations were made. After a few minutes of insisting they finally checked their notes and confirmed that we indeed had make reservations. They then led us to a table for 6 people not 7 and simply added a measly chair at the head of a table for the 7th person. How is a group of 7 grown adults suppose to eat their meals probably when there is barely any room for your plate? I asked politely for the waitress to add another small table but she said NO even though the restaurant was 70% empty. I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said there is no manager. I asked who is in charge and she said no one. We then told her we will only be here for 45 minutes because we had a broadway show to catch in a hour she still refused. We finally gave in and got seated. \n\nMy dad who is slightly far-sighted asked the same waitress for food recommendations because he couldn't read the small print on the menu. The waitress refused to offer her recommendation and instead she rudely told my dad to just read the menu. \n\nAs for the food. The flavor is decent but the portions are extremely small and overpriced.\nI usually don't complain much about service but the way we were treated here was just abysmal.\n\nI DO NOT recommend coming here." u'This place is a hidden GEM in the madness of midtown. A fabulously non-touristy tea house great for meeting friends over drinks and small plates. \n\nThe dumplings here were unbelievable and I sat here for a few hours talking to a friend without feeling any pressure from our waiter. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to venture away from a major chain coffee shop!' u"I was walking along 55th st. one day to get to another restaraunt and I caught site of the tea house entrance with my girflriend. Intrigued we decided to check it out. This is a great place for lunch on a hot day. The place is really nice and sets a relaxing mood. They have decorative books and tea kettles lining the walls. They have a very big list of premium tea to choose from and they even have really delicious iced tea and dessert tea that are mixed with coffee. They have a lunch and dinner menu. The food is incredible I tried the dan dan noodles the spicy chicken noodle spicy chicken dumplings and the hot and sour seafood soup. All of it was tastier than I imagined and set a new standard for me. If any of my friends visit NY i'll be bringing them here."],0.4767,0.22,0.78,0.0
123.Xi’an Famous Foods,[u"Came to this location after craving some Xi'an foods. I think this might be one of their newer locations but this one is HUGE! There's plenty of seating and not much loitering so you wouldn't wait too long for a seat. I ordered the spicy beef noodles and a pork burger. \n\nComing from Xi'an myself I'm very familiar with Xi'an foods. The noodles were cooked very well and it was extremely flavorful. The burger however could use a little bit more fattiness (which is how it's usually fat in Xi'an). Overall the experience was great and would definitely come here again!" u'After running 6 miles around Central Park I needed to feed. "FEED ME!"  Eating a lamb burger after a run just hits the spot. Carbs protein crispy cumin meaty all wins in my book after a run.\n\nSo I walked over to Xian for a lamb burger and the spicy lamb noodles.\nNoodles excellent like always.\nI liked that fact that there are more crunchy veggies in the lamb for both the burger and the noodles.\nHowever unlike the other Xian locations the lamb seemed to be less spicy. It tasted similar but I hardly broke a sweat eating it. \nThe burger is also not as crispy. It was kinda soft when I got the last bite. Consider the fact I was hungry and I just scarfed it down.\n\nI also found it odd there\'s so little seating for such a big location.\nPlus side the restrooms were clean.' u"If you don't like noodles than chances are you've never had hand-pulled noodles made in house especially from Xi'an Famous Foods.  It's authentic fresh and pays homage to the City of Xi'an in China.  \n\nThe place was packed as suspected when we came for lunch service.  The only seating is counter seating against the wall so you're likely to sit side to side with strangers.  You order at the register and wait until your food is ready for either take-out or dine-in.  Since I came on a weekday the place was mostly packed with workers getting take-out which made it easier to find a seat.  Otherwise I don't recommend coming in with a group if you plan to dine-in.  \n\nWe ordered the Spicy Cumin Lamb Spicy & Tingly Beef and Pork Zha Jiang Hand-Ripped Noodles all of which were recommended by the cashier.  All of them were fantastic.  Of the three my favorite was the Spicy Cumin Lamb which had incredible flavor from the cumin chili flakes and oil.  It was very reflective of the region of Xi'an as many of the dishes use Middle Eastern spices like cumin in their recipes.  The lamb was also tender and juicy and loved the spice.  (Warning - if you don't like spice proceed with caution if you eat here as all of the dishes are made with chili.)  \n\nOverall this is a fantastic place for authentic noodle dishes from the Xi'an area.  It's famous for good reason." u"What can I say if Anthony Bourdain says this place is his fav noodles place who am I argue?\n\nIndeed the place was packed had a long line of locals when we checked in at this location on 54th just across from where I was staying at. Timing was perfect after checking in at 11:30ish at my hotel I was famished and this location was a very short walk. Even though the line was all the way to the door it was also fast service.\n\nThere's plenty of flavors from noodles saut\xe9e to soup. I grabbed two seats that were just vacated while my companion ordered waited 5min or so then our number was called. The place has two long narrow parallel benches along each walls adorned with stools where people dining in can sit and eat. The middle space was left for people to line up to the counter to order the food by design which was a smart & efficient concept!\n\nThe noodles were fresh and tasty with lots of spicy flavors. We ordered lamb beef & pork and to me the pork had the most flavor & spice. Plates starts at $12 each and for NY lunch that's very good! Make sure you're hungry because it's plentiful better get it on to go box for left over the next day though most of the diners simply debauch no problem for it's that good! Add this to a million reason why I love NY!" u"Yes! I've only tried Xi'an food a few times but I love it because it's quite different than the typical canto or Shanghai Chinese restaurants. \n\nAlways measure a Xi'an restaurant's quality with their cumin lamb burger and noodles. Honestly their lamb burger fell flat. The bread was dry and tasteless and the lamb just barely saved it by having that great cumin with a kick of spice. However I thought the stir fried cold noodles were wonderful! Amazing flavor and the mild spicyness was perfect for me. Definitely need to eat the burger with noodles!\n\nFor drinks they have a few tea options. Get the chrysanthemum tea lightly sweetened and perfectly refreshing. Really cheap too. I almost bought a second cup because it paired well with the spicy foods. \n\nOverall the food here is not bad. Service is quick prices are moderate the place is clean and modern. \n\nFood: 4/5\nValue: 3.75/5\nService: 4/5\nOverall: 4/5" u"As the decades roll by we see more waves of regional Chinese cuisine sweep us Americans over in delight. The latest one to become mainstream (after Sichuan fare) is from the Central Chinese province of Shaanxi. \n\nThis vegetarian friendly fast food style mini chain is named after the capital city of Xi'an - home to the Terracotta Army and also the eastern most point of the Silk Road. It is easy to recognize the influence of regional cultures along the route on the food as merchants traveled in for trade. From Cumin-Lamb Burgers to big and chewy Biang-Biang noodles much of the fare feels light on the palate with bright sour and spicy chili oils accompanying a lot of the dishes. \n\nRecommend the Liang Pi (A1) the Spicy Cumin-Lamb Burger (B2) Spicy & Tingly Beef Hand-Ripped Noodles in Soup (Ns2) Spicy Asian Cucumber Salad (L2) and Chang-An Spicy Tofu (F1) for a nice sampling spread for 2-3 individuals.\n\nService is fast with much of the business being take out but if one chooses to dine-in there is basic bar seating along the wall." u"There is a long line at lunch but it moves quickly and is well worth it.  Xi'an and western Chinese food are some of my favorites with thick noodles great spices dumplings and hearty lamb pork and beef but it is pretty hard to find in most of the US compared to more mainstream types of Chinese food from the coastal areas.  My favorite dish is the lamb dumpling soup." u'I ordered the N8-Spicy Hot Oil-Seared Noodles. I thought the noodles were great! These hand ripped noodles are one of my favorite types of noodles since they are chewy and wide. The noodles were not that spicy and I could definitely handle a bit more heat. I loved how garlicky the noodles were--but beware since your breath will be for a while! Solid plate of food. I would definitely come back and perhaps try their spicy cumin lamb noodles.\n\nThe setup of this place reminds me of a food court since there are no tables and no servers. They only have bar-style seating along the wall so it can be a bit awkward if you come in a larger group. You order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called to pick up your food.' u'Came here before a Broadway show. Less than 10 minute walk to a few theaters making it a convenient and non-pricey spot for a pre-show meal. A few locations in Manhattan and Flushing! \n\nLimited seating spacious restaurant. You can order to-go or for here. They recommend eating the food asap for it to taste best. Their chili oil is what makes this place so special. \n\nOrdered the spicy & tingly beef hand-ripped noodles (mild). It is about $11 for a dish. You can watch them make it too. Noodles are huge thick and chewy. I normally share a platter with someone. Beef is tender. Their food is on the spicier-side but the mild was a good balance of spice and flavor.' u"I'm still dreaming about the noodles I ate here the other day. I ordered the spicy tingly beef noodles. And man oh man were they spicy and tingly. I like that there is seating along the walls so that yo can dine there. Also thought the fans were helpful to bring down the heat from the food :) I contemplated on getting it mild but for some reason spiciness always gets me and its like a thrill chase. You can definitely tell that the noodles were freshly made as they were easy to grab and didn't really stick to each other.  I left the place craving more even though I had a runny nose and was teary eyed (of joy of course)" u'Fast cheap and delicious! Definitely recommend this place and so glad they now have new locations in nyc. I\'m not a local and wish they\'d bring this to California. We stopped here for dinner after touring the MoMA which is across the street. My SO and I ordered the pork "burger" b1 and spicy beef noodles n2. I love their noodles- thick chewy and perfectly cooked. The dish was a little spicy but so good. The beef was so tender. There aren\'t too many Xi\'an restaurants where I live but this is the definitely the best I\'ve had.  Dinner here cost about $15 for the two of us which was a steal.' u'Well this was a pleasant surprise!  Tasty noodles in a bright clean space. You can add spice to make it as hot as you want. \nA little pricey but still not bad.' u"Oxtail soup here is to die for :). Great price for midtown and some amazing food - can't beat it!" u"After my first Xi'an Famous Food experience I was down to try this location near where we were shopping on Fifth Ave. \n\nLet me start off with... what happened to the prices??? Prices are almost double the prices at the  St. Mark's Place location. I get that this is Midtown... but damn.\n\nWe ordered quite a bit of food for 5 people and took over the entire row of seats nearest the counter. Our meal was reasonably priced given how much the individual prices were per entree. I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup which was spicy AF even though I asked for them to go lighter on the spicy. My dad also wanted to try the B1 stewed pork sandwich which had fragrant and tender (and the perfect amount of fat) pork. \n\nOverall I was happy with our meal. It was cheaper than the other options in the area but it is still more expensive than other locations although maybe prices have just gone up in all other locations without me knowing..." u"This location is a bit pricier than the other one in midtown and the one in East village but I haven't been back to those recently so it's possible that their prices have risen as well.\n\nWith Xi'an you can't go wrong with their classic flat noodles whether you get them with pork lamb chicken or veg. The two burgers are a great snack and a tremendous value.\n\nOne small nitpick about this location: I wanted some black vinegar for my noodles asked the kitchen for some they said all the bottles were out in the room. I checked the room and there were two bottles circulating in a room of 30 stools.\n\nThe layout of the room here gives a decent amount of stool seats while obviously being arranged to accommodate a long line of people during a lunch rush" u'Came here because everyone talks about it being a must-do when visiting NY. I\'m Chinese and I\'m a sucker for great noodles so I checked this out with my boyfriend when we were visiting. We got the Oxtail noodle soup the Lamb noodles and the spinach dumplings.\n\nThe oxtail noodle soup & lamb noodles were both great. The meat is flavorful the noodles are chewy and fat (just how I like them!) and all the flavors and textures really worked together well.\n\nWhat I didn\'t like were the spinach dumplings. The inside and the outside didn\'t work together the whole thing just tasted terrible. We actually didn\'t even eat them because neither of us wanted to stuff ourselves with these dumplings lol. Would come for the noodles skip the dumplings!\n\nThere\'s minimal seating just 2 long counters along each wall with stools so it\'s not really a "sit down" type of restaurant. If you come when it\'s not busy people are usually leaving pretty fast so you can snag a seat. Not sure how it would be if it was busy - I imagine people would have to take it to go? Or just stand around until someone leaves? The whole establishment is clean and the line moves fast so that was great. We were in & out in about 30 min including all of the eating!' u"Came here to meet up with this friend of mine who had moved from Charlotte (ALL HE TALKS ABOUT IS THIS PLACE). So for a long Friday lunch took the long trek from 42nd street to the Xi'An here. Ordered the N2 Spicy Noodle ($11.55 all in after tax). This reminds of those small fast food joints in Hong Kong. Lighting was very bright things are very bright in here and order comes super quick.\n\nSpicy Noodles: Comes on a Foam plate (are these even legal in NYC still?) with several yummy pieces of beef and very very small amounts of veggies and think udon like noodles. Decent portion size but my plate was a little lacking wish i had a couple extra noodles or beef on it and the price was alright (could definitely be cheaper).I think each Xi'An prices the food differently depending on location." u'Food is great but the real star is that Jasmine tea! The place was clean and the line moves relatively fast. I got the Concubine chicken hand pulled noddles with spice level very spicy and it was delicious! The noodles are amazing the chicken was dark meat and as advertised; had shards of bone in it which was completely awful/dangerous. The highest spicy level was mild for a spice lover in my opinion. Though it was delicious it was really heavy on the oil. There is nothing healthy about this. I can however write an ode to how amazing and refreshing that Jasmine tea was.  Would totally recommend I have it on good authority (chinese friends) that this place is rather authentic to the Chinese tradition. So try it if you like noodles!' u"We knew about this spot bc a friend said he eats at this place almost everyday. He loves it here but says the prices are slowing hiking up. Our lamb noodle was $11.21 not terribly bad but it wasn't cheap either. \n\nThe significant other and I shared the spicy cumin lamb noodles and it was super good! It was really spicy not like the Americanized version of spicy. The portion size wasn't bad either. There was a good mixture of lamb veggies and noodles. The only downer to the meal was how it could have been less oily. \n\nThe drink prices seem to be cheap though. You can get a tea drink for only $2. I chose to get an apple soda looking drink though for about the same price. \n\nXi'an Famous Foods is located near MoMA so check out the museum on a free Friday." u"I come here for lunch every other week and order N2 (spicy beef noodles) every single time. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I feel like I don't need to. The noodles are a good texture and there are sizable chunks of beef in the dish.\n\nThe buns are decent but not worth what they charge. Same with the cucumber dish - stick to the noodle dishes.\n\nThere's also a fridge with very chinese drinks in it. If you've never had it try the sour hawberry drink."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
92.minigrow,[u"My 3rd Time and it's finally start to shape as a place to consider for lunch as consistent option.\nSize measure to expectations and taste freshness and quality definitely at high level for the right price.\nGot this time the noodles with the fantastic fresh pesto sauce and roasted chicken .\nThey have great toppings in addition to their very flavorable MG spice.\nQuick lines & great service ." u'Today was my second visit here I had come during their first week so wanted to give it another shot. \n\nFirst the place is very narrow with a mouse maze set up too many employees screaming over each other. On the plus side they\'re all very helpful and friendly if you have a question. \n\nI had remembered to grab a menu from the nice girl outside because I found not knowing the noodle options while on the line resulted in me asking a bunch of questions which aren\'t easy for them to hear and you feel like you have to yell. \n\nSo as for the actual food..you pick a base personally I am always a noodle lover! First time I had the 3 wheat noodles this time I went for the spinach noodles with the pesto sauce.  As for the protein I had the chicken thigh on my first visit against my first instinct to say "no thanks" and I should have.. it wasn\'t that tasty and almost grayish in color. What made me very sad is their lack of vegetable choices it was only sad looking cafeteria corn mushrooms onion sun dried tomato or broccoli. They can also add cucumber kimchi and carrots as a garnish. \n\nThis place is at least something different in the neighborhood and hits the spot if I have a noodle craving. I\'m not sure I will be coming back as this place doesn\'t wow me. I\'m a veggie lover and Dig Inn will always have my heart!' u"I am a bit troubled by the lack of transparency in pricing.  Neither the large size menu above the counter nor the printed ones handed out show the dollar amount of any food item.  In addition the website menu has no pricing on it either.  As a consumer it would be helpful to know how much the food costs.  It wasn't very clear to me based on random stickers afixed to the glass partition separating the customer from the food assembly line how much the base pricing and add on's will total to.  One encounters these stickers only after s/he initially orders the base item.  So a decision based on pricing can't be made in advance.\n\nIt was particularly difficult to determine the cost when I stood in a crowded loud and busy lunch line.  No one behind the counter could explain the pricing (in fact they couldn't even hear my order).  I had to hold up the printed menu I had in my hand and point to the item I wanted to order.\n\nThe food itself is high quality and fresh.  Tastewise it isn't bad. \n\nPricewise it's a bit steep for the portion size served." u'A new smaller version of Honeygrow (hence the mini) just quietly opened in a packed area of Midtown serving a scaled down version of what they have at their several other locations including their first NYC location in Brooklyn.\n\nYou can walk in now and order food though the grand opening is officially on Monday. Like the other stores they have noodle and salad bowls here but it\'s more of a fast casual style where you pick out each component as you go through the line instead of the kiosk system they have in Brooklyn.\n\nDefinitely try the special preset "Chicken Jawn" combo here a noodle base with chicken onions black truffle miso corn chives and Parmesan. You can also get bowls with a spinach base if you\'re here to be healthy.\n\nThis is one of the more unique and high quality fast casual options out there so definitely give it a try for a quick lunch in midtown.' u"Really awesome build your own bowl/salad place. So many vegan and gluten free options too! They also recommend what sauces to do with which bases which is helpful. Everything is fresh and delicious and the staff was nice and didn't rush me as I was deciding what toppings I wanted. A really good spot for a quick healthy and filling lunch!" u"I was super excited Minigrow finally opened a block away from my office.  I know they use Sun Noodle so I know for sure I will be happy with their noodles.\n\nHere is what I ordered:\n\nBASE ($8.45)\nSpinach Noodles\n\nSAUCE\nGreen Curry Lemongrass\n\nPROTEIN (depends on what you get it may be additional $250 - $5.00)\nRoasted Chicken Thigh ($2.50)\n\nTOPPRINGS\n1) Sesame Cucumbers\n2) Miso Corn\n3) Roasted Mushrooms and 4) Scallions\n\nGARNISH\nCrispy Shallots\n\nIt's similar to Dig Inn or Between the Bread type of a lunch spot except your base is either noodles or rice.\n\nMine came out to be $11.92.  I think it is on a tiny bit on the expensive side for lunch but I really enjoyed the food.  They did just open yesterday so it seems a little chaotic in there but I will definitely go back to try out different combination of their sauces proteins toppings and garnish.\n\nGreat job Minigrow!  Thanks for bringing us another good lunch option!!" u"Was already a fan of honeygrow from philly so was super excited to see minigrow open up and definitely was not disappointed. Have tried the spinach noodles zucchini noodles and the chicken jawn. The chicken jawn is my favorite so far but the spinach noodles are also really good. Toppings are good- the sweet and sour onions are amazing and I recommend the black pepper tahini sauce! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Love the vibes here too!" u"Went here for lunch recently. I was kind of forced but that doesn't affect my decision about how good or bad it was. It is just another bowl place. It is nothing special in fact mine was pretty average. \nChicken thigh jasmine rice broccoli corn carrot. Had the red miso dressing. Was average. Line was average. Just didn't get above a 3/5 for me. Won't blow your mind." u"I live a block away from the Honeygrow in Brooklyn so I was SUPER pumped to have minigrow open up a couple of blocks away from the office. I love that they have a different menu than the BK location too.\n\nWhile I love the menu and think the portion sizes are pretty fair I kind of felt like the atmosphere is kind of lacking. I get that they just opened and I totally understand that lunchtime is going to bring a huge rush but I hate the assembly line concept they have going in this location. Brooklyn's Honeygrow has tablets which make it easy to customize and order which I was bummed this location didn't have. Other lunch places in the area -- like Eatsa for example -- use tablets to compile orders so I wish this new location used them too. I just hate being hurried along and it totally detracts from the experience for me." u'Amazing food and amazing experience. Already a huge fan of honeygrow and love the new iteration of the concept. If you want tasty food friendly service and a great value go here!!!\n\nHad the noodle bowl with pork shoulder and green curry. Flavors were on point and the portion was huge!  \n\nHats off to the entire team that put this together!!\n\nCheers!!!' u"So happy this place just opened up near my office. The process was so quick and the food was so flavorful. Portions were very big but if you want to get salmon as protein it's way too over priced. I love that they did have zoodles as a healthy alternative. Can't wait to go back." u'Perfect midtown lunch spot. So glad this place exists. Awesome fresh ingredients and great quick service. I want to go back literally right now.' u'Stumbled upon this place today and happily so. Food is amazing portions are huge I did not finish! Looking forward to coming back to try other items so many great options to choose from.' u'If you\'re looking for somewhere to eat in Midtown that is not only delicious but quick and convenient stop what you are doing and go directly to minigrow! My colleagues and I went there last week and it was delicious.  \n\nFood was awesome and they have a ton of healthy options (zucchini noodles spinach base salmon etc). I went with the zucchini noodles salmon miso corn roasted mushrooms pickled carrots and ginger scallion soy sauce; was delicious! Great portions and very reasonably priced for the quality of food. My colleague went with the "Chicken Jawn" which he said he loved and another one of my colleagues is Gluten-Free and he had no issue with compromising options or taste. Once we finished we all grabbed one of the juices that they make (I went with the Carrot Juice) and that was great.\n\nThere are a ton of options in Midtown to eat but minigrow stands out as a place that serves delicious and healthy food that is convenient. Will 100% be back soon!' u'I was looking forward to lunch all day as it just opened around the corner from my office but I am disappointed. The portion size of noodles and meat was reasonable and the toppings and veggies were tasty but the ginger scallion soy sauce spoiled it for me not sure why as I always love soy/ginger and scallion based sauces and marinades . This sauce has a strange aftertaste that overpowers everything in the bowl. I will chalk this up to first day; perhaps there was too much sauce in my noodles. Next time I will try a different sauce/dressing and perhaps a salad instead.' u'I was so excited when I heard minigrow was opening and it did not disappoint! I went on opening day and got through the line really quickly. The staff was super friendly upbeat explained the menu and handled out cookie and juice samples while we waited in line. I got the noodles with salmon and a bunch of veggies with the lemongrass sauce and it was so.so.good! Definitely recommend going and stoked they are opening more locations in the city!' u"Mini grow! I was passing by and the crew caught my attention... explained the menu in quick 30 seconds. In next 5 minutes I was eating a bowl of the delicious meal on the earth!!! The best pork shoulders I have ever tasted.... excellent customer service I was amazed to see the manager's dedication in attending each customer!!!! 5 stars...."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
87.Dig Inn,[u"Not a place to be missed! \n\nWhenever I forget or don't have time to make lunch at home this is the place I go. The food is healthy fresh and so delicious. It basically works like an assembly line/chipotle/build your own meal. You pick a base like rice quinoa salad; then two sides like tomato salad roasted tricolor carrots Mac & cheese (so good and actually not unhealthy) roasted sweet potatoes saut\xe9ed kale this list goes on and then your protein- the meatballs are amazing and juicy and the chicken breast always hits the spot. I highly recommend their house made sriracha too to kick it up a notch. \n\n\nSometimes the line is long but you can order ahead online to pick up at a specific time which makes it even better. \n\nThey have staple menu items but some of their sides change seasonally which is also great. Keeps it interesting!" u"I was excited to try this place since it's quick healthy food and it's a good location. They don't have menu boards up anywhere so walking in for the first time was a little confusing. The employees were very nice and walked me through the process of the elements that went into the bowl. There were actually menu cards hanging on the wall out of the way but they weren't easy to spot. \n\nI got a brown rice bowl with carrots broccoli salad and chicken breast. The chicken and broccoli were SO good wow I was very impressed. The carrots were not my favorite they tasted too sweet for a reason I couldn't identify. The rice was cooked well but just tasted like rice. I also got the rosemary dressing which was very acidic. Not bad but not what I was expecting. It was $12 for the bowl which I think was very reasonable. \n\nThere was an okay amount of seating but the turnover was quick so I was able to snag a barstool no problem. \n\nI would compare them to The Little Beet the same kind of healthy fast food. With that comparison it just wasn't as good as The Little Beet. I just know this style of food can be even better so that's why I knocked off a star. I will probably return to this location since I'm working close to here and will update my review when I try other items." u"The amount of salt they use on their products is RIDIC. The portions were large and I really wanted to be able to finish it all because of the money I spent. But...the salt. PLEASE! Do you guys taste the food before serving? \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's a perfect to-go meal and it's also close to my job but no. What a shame." u"I like Dig Inn because the food is healthy the ingredients are local and you can always get a very balanced meal with lots of vegetables. It's not the cheapest meal -- unless you get a market bowl with 3 sides the lowest is about $11 after tax -- but the quality is good.\n\nThis was my first time at this location of Dig Inn and the space was very bright and open. There was some counter seating and a few tables but not a huge spot. The food was solid as usual. I love their meatballs and rice and the tomato salad they had was perfect for the last days of summer especially with some of their rosemary vinaigrette sauce. I didn't love the carrot salad as much but there are so many options all the time that I can just get something else next time." u"At this price point you will not find another food concept that gives you the same breadth of healthy fresh delicious options. The missing star is not food related\n\nHere's my thoughts on individual food items (I see myself coming here often so I'll update when I get new items):\n\nMarket greens (base): serious diversity of greens but the quantity pales to the amount they give you if you order one of the grains. Some greens are nice and hearty too\n\nGrilled peaches (side): hit or miss - well grilled but many peaches are under ripe hard and sour\n\nSauteed kale (side): packed with flavor and fiber seasoned with tomatoes and maybe a bit of citrus. This is my top pick for vegetable side!\n\nRoasted broccoli (side): they always have it and it's consistently decent. Some pieces get roasted quite well only complain is that some of the larger pieces have a bit of an underdone raw crunch in the middle\n\nKale with feta (side): I think dressed with a bit of lemon too not too heavy on the feta kale is nice and fresh\n\nGrilled chicken thigh (protein ): great char stays moist despite being cut in advance. Good flavor\n\nGarlic sauce (dressing): vegan made with tofu. You can't really taste the tofu but the garlic tastes fairly muted. I'll probably opt for something else next time\n\nAs for the missing star: there's only about 15 seats in here the air conditioning isn't really working and some of the metal utensils aren't very clean. Will update to five stars if these things change :)" u"Great fresh options and solid pricing considering how much you actually get.\n\nThe mac and cheese is the best guilty pleasure! Salmon and kale were also really good. Kale didn't lack flavor and salmon seemed fresh. So glad there's finally more healthy options around Hell's Kitchen." u"I've been seeing a lot of these emerging around the city so when one opened by my office I was excited to try it. First of all let me just talk about the aesthetics. White marble counters + tables and a very bright welcoming atmosphere which makes it enjoyable to dine-in. The workers are also so friendly and enthusiastic when making your bowl! \n\nIt's a set price for $11 a bowl and you get your choice of rice or quinoa protein (salmon chicken steak) and then your choice of two sides which is a vegetable and then a more home-style side + your choice of sauce. I got rice with chicken string beans and kale + pesto sauce. Everything was seasoned so beautifully! I will definitely be returning for lunch." u"This is fast casual done right. It's Chipotle done with American food and in a bowl. Pick your base 2 sides a protein and your sauces and you're done. The lines get long at the lunch rush but they move very quickly so don't be scared even if the line goes out the door. Along those lines look at the menu while you're in line because you won't have a lot of time at the front to make your decisions.\n\nIt's not so spectacular for it to be a prime destination for tourists but if you like living like the locals this is what they do." u"This is a fantastic quick lunch place full of amazing and fresh ingredients. One chooses 1 main and 2 sides for the selections. We chose salmon with radishes and broccoli. All of the ingredients tasted like farm to table bursting with flavor. The salad was way better than bouchon or nougatine where the quality suppose to be impeccable and we found the best salad here at this unpretentious little lunch spot that just does the basics and let the ingredients shine through. All of the vegetables are perfectly seasoned - one doesn't really need additional seasoning that's offered at the end. \n\nChef and staff thanks for making amazing food so accessible to everyone!!!" u'Awesome option for vegetarians! Basically you choose a base and 2 sides plus a "protein" or another side. I opted for the 3 sides & it was a great deal. All of it is delicious but there\'s also sauces for extra umph.' u"Digg In is one of my favorite NYC on the go lunch spots. Their harvest bowls feature delicious fresh ingredients robust flavors for a meal that's healthy and tasty. The restaurant on 8th is small but bright and clean. If you're looking for healthy on the go...i recommend." u"A new Dig Inn just opened up in the West 50s and by golly it is a miracle. No longer are the West 50s a wasteland of Thai food and delis. The good lord has brought us some good hearty food. Hallelujah. \n\nIf you haven't been to any of the Dig Inns stop reading this review right now and go. Just go. Dig Inn's specialty is the market plate.\n1) choose a base: rice farro greens or noodles\n2) choose your market sides: these rotate but will probably include some starches some greens some salads some fruits lots of vegetables.\n3) choose your protein: chicken breast chicken thigh beef salmon tofu meatball\n\nThe people at Dig Inn are some of the friendliest. Everyone seems as happy as a clam to be working there. \n\nCompared to the other Dig Inns I've been to this one is straight out of a foodie blogger's instagram dream. Herringbone floors quartz counters wood and succulents abound. \n\nWhile it is a little on the pricey side it's worth the splurge. Now go get your freak on (at Dig Inn)" u"Healthy alternative in the heart of midtown!\nThe line is usually out the door during lunch due to its location but worth the 10 minute wait. Don't plan on eating there due to its limited seating. \n\nMy go to is the squash & chicken breast. (Never liked squash till I tried Digg Inn's squash) Would not recommend the steak due to the fact that it's very dry. \n\nThe workers are extremely friendly however when they are taking your order you have to shout due to the amount of people in the small area. \n\n$13 for a bowl (an average price for a meal for the area)" u'Great service great food!!!I am definitely going back!!! The restaurant was super neat and clean. My favorite place.' u'Great place for a casual bite. Healthy and good variety.' u'Oh my gosh AWESOME place!! Great food accompanied by such good service. The staff was helpful & knowledgable about the food and very  friendly!!' u"I appreciate that they're tying to do healthy hearty food here and I've eaten at Dig probably 30 times. But my experiences have been very inconsistent and often mediocre (this goes for the whole chain not just this location). \n\nThe salmon and the chicken breast both are usually super dry and lacking flavor like they've been sitting out too long. There were a few times they were pretty good. The meatballs are consistently pretty good.\n\nThe sides are really hit or miss and inconsistent. Often things like broccoli or sweet potatoes are blackened too much. The fruit salads over the summer were often cut too close to the time of the rind of the fruit leaving inedibly tough fruit parts in the salad.\n\nI'll go back but I hope they take it upon themselves to get better." u"First discovered this place from my amazing colleague (who is a Yelp Elite just saying) and fell in love with the food as soon as I had my first bite.\n\nI ordered the bowl which came with a base (choice of rice quinoa or greens) 2 side and a protein dish.  As for my bowl specifically I went with the brown rice roasted broccoli sweet potatoes and the steak.  Although the broccoli in my opinion is a little too big and seemed a little under cooked the sweet potatoes were cooked perfectly and as soft as can be.  As for the steak it was a little dry but the flavors were amazing and I really enjoyed each and every bite.  \n\nIf you're in the city and looking for a healthy light meal I definitely recommend this place.  Convenient fast and delicious food." u'Another Dig Inn location in a busy lunch area this one with the usual strange-textured salmon but solid sides:\nWILD SOCKEYE SALMON+1- $14.24\n+ Toasted Farro w/ Butternut Squash & Celery\n+ Brussels Sprouts w/ Maple Sriracha\n+ Roasted Carrots w/ Kale & Pumpkin Seed Pesto\n+ Avocado $1.38\n+ Add Extra Tofu $0.92\n+ House-made Sriracha' u"I placed an order today and was so impressed with my first time ordering earlier this week I returned today and quite frankly I'm grossed out. I know Roasted Chicken is going to contain some cartilage but the chicken was simply inedible. It was all cartilage. I wanted to puke. I had to throw out each piece of chicken out of my bowl. Very upsetting. Two stars because I loved my first bowl and thought to myself perfect new place to eat! Yuck yuck yuck!\n\nUPDATE: the team at Dig Inn quickly reached out and offered their apologies and offered a bowl on them. This speaks volumes about their business and customer service. Thanks Esther & team."],0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0
128.Fresh From Hell,[u'Thank gosh this place was walking distance (on the same street) of our hotel! Can\'t go wrong with grabbing some "fresh" breakfast before heading out for some more tourist-y fun!! We came here around 10ish am expecting a lot of people but no there were just two people dining in. \n\nWe were greeted by this kind and passionate gentleman working the register he immediately welcomed us saying they were the best from Hell\'s Kitchen I\'m falling in love already. The place is small but it\'s cute colorful music playing are pop instrumentals with classical which is calm and suits the place the workers are very very friendly! The place is clean and neat with standing and sitting tables (shelf like table attached to the wall something you see a lot in these small eateries). \n\nThe gentleman working the register was very kind to explain the menu and took our order with ease. We both ordered the A\xe7ai bowl w/ superfood. It was splendid! We both devoured!! While eating he was able to socialize with us and that made the experience worthwhile. \n\nThanks for the great experience FRESH FROM HELL! God bless you guys and your business. I\'ll definitely recommend this place to my friends and family who visit NYC.' u"You can't go wrong with Fresh From Hell. \n\nThe management is not only polite and friendly they're conscientious too. When I arrived the manager was carefully explaining how the Seamless valet needed to have a helmet and vest in order to avoid a fine and also be safe. He even took the time to tell the guy where and how to acquire those items. I used the 10% discount from Yelp and was pleased to to be thanked not scoffed at when I did so. \n\nOn top of that the selection of juices and smoothies is great and based on the one I ordered Clean Protein they're delicious as well. \n\nYou gotta love the name of the shop too. I'll definitely patronize this place again!" u"Had Chicken Salad on baguette. Really really good and fresh. Make sure you eat over your plate as chicken will fall out of the sandwich. Chicken is cut into larger chunks and had a good texture--was not over cooked. Also had the Tomato Bisque soup.\n\nThere is seating for maybe 4 people here. We ate quickly and faced the orange wall. See if you can find a 'hidden cat face' in the orange wall!" u"Amazing smoothie and juice selection! Great spot for a vegan on the go to find especially in this area. If I'm ever around here and am cravin' a snack quick meal smoothie or juice I'd come here again for sure. They have a  small bar where you can eat your quick something before heading back out." u"The genuine kindness and customer service we were given is extremely hard to come by in this area. The owner was extremely nice and took his time to explain the whole menu while we were deciding what to order. He explained that everything is made in-house fresh and there's many vegan options as well. Though it is a small take-out restaurant with only a few stools against the window to sit you can tell the passion that all the employees have. \n\nI got the Gym Buddy smoothie consisting of bananas chocolate almond milk protein & peanut butter. The consistency was perfect and it definitely is a healthy place so no added sugars either. In addition I got the panini of the day which had tomatoes mozzarella & basil. The panini was pressed perfectly and all the components did taste really fresh. \n\nDefinitely will be returning for lunch!" u"The food here is delicious. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Overall it's a fantastic hidden gem lunch option in midtown west. The butternut squash soup is my favorite thing on the menu - I could eat it every day. \n\nMy advice to anyone in a rush or ordering for a group (even small) is to call ahead so they can start your order. All the sandwiches are made fresh upon ordering (meat and cheese even sliced fresh upon ordering) so can take a few minutes longer than a typical deli assembly line but is well worth the short wait!" u"I recently moved over here and was looking for my go-to juice/smoothie/yummy healthy food spot and this place was just that and more. I've tried many things off the menu but I'd have to say my number one is the cashew cream cheese bagel with marinated cucumbers. Seriously one of the most delicious things I have ever had and I unfortunately have to move away but I will go out of my way to come here and visit this spot. Also something I really is that unlike many of the big juice and smoothie chains they make everything right on the spot and they also make there own almond milk. Wonderful service as well :) make you feel at home!" u"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a Sunday for lunch. The place is not very big and does not have much in the way of seating. Nevertheless the staff was very friendly and even explained the various options on their menu.\n\nAfter perusing a bit I decided to go with the Acai bowl. The bowl was good though i felt that at almost $10 it was a little on the expensive side especially considering they don't offer much of a space to eat it." u'Refreshing smoothie! Great fresh ingredients. Will definitely return for their acai breakfast bowl!' u'Should be called Fresh from Heaven...\n\nGreat super fresh food nice people fairly priced. Salads sandwiches soups juices and smoothies-all delicious and healthy!' u"Best acai bowl I've had in the city. Seriously. \n\nI had time to kill before a matinee show and was craving something fresh and fruity -- Fresh From Hell was perfect. My acai bowl was beautiful delicious and a great mix of textures and flavors.  \n\nPrices are reasonable (you're gonna pay $9 for a smoothie or bowl but that's standard) and the staff is really friendly. \n\nCan't wait to go back!" u"Tried the Boo Berry smoothie and wasn't super impressed especially for the $9 price. Yes they use fresh ingredients but in terms of taste it wasn't anything special. If the smoothies were $5 I'd consider giving this place 4 stars." u'Amazing service and friendly helpful staff. Grab a quick healthy bite - great soups smoothies sandwiches and salads! They even have acai bowls!' u'Great vegan place near time square options form on vegans.  We had a sandwich and my daughter a great vegan oatmeal.' u'I had a certificate from Restaurants.com that I wanted to use and this place was close to work and seemed like a good lunch spot.\n\nMy intestinal instincts were right. It\'s a cute little soup/salad/sammich/smoothie spot that doesn\'t break the bank. Everything is priced under $10 but you\'ll be spending closer to $20 if you want more than one thing. \n\nI order a large mixed salad and a smoothie. \n\nThe salad wasn\'t what I was expecting in that I\'m used to places like Chopt where I tell them what I want and they add it. Here you have pre-made "salad" toppings such as tuna salad bean salad greek salad etc. that go on top of your greens. With a large you\'re allowed to pick 3 options. The salad was filling and I really enjoyed it.\n\nI opted for the Boo Berry smoothie and thought it was pretty good. Filling (Strawberries blueberries raspberries banana vanilla almond milk vanilla whey protein) and flavorful. \n\nGiven the proximity to my office this is a place I\'d come to again. I wish the menu was a *bit* larger but this also does me the favor of not being overwhelmed with options.' u'Great sandwiches and the best butter nut squash soup!  Friendly staff too.  I highly recommend!' u"I've had the chicken veggie soup and the mango cleanser smoothie they were both top notch. Actually one of the best smoothies I've ever had and I have been trying to recreate it at home. Good friendly and quick service. Would highly recommend for people that like quality ingredients that are put together very well with great pallet choices." u'Fresh and delicious. The Green Machine Smoothie was perfect and people are great. Really nice helpful and a pleasure to talk with. And they let me add a little mint to the Green Machine so good. My wife loved her salad and we both plan to go back' u'I came here for lunch recently. Got a sandwich and smoothie. both were good smoothie was expensive at almost $9 tho food was fresh\ni would return for food most likely i would skip the smoothie \n\nFood - good\nService - Good\nAtmosphere- Average' u"Good food! home made! You can test the freshness in their food. Good service and cute place. They also have smoothies and sandwiches. Little gem in Hell's Kitchen.."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
145.Balade - Your Way,[u"I've had this place bookmarked for a while but never made it before because every time I thought about going it was on the weekends and they are closed on weekends. I finally got there recently and it was so good that I really wish I had tried it sooner.\n\nI got the pita wrap which you get to customize with a protein 4 toppings and a bunch of sauces.  (They also have salads and bowls that you can do the same with Chipotle-style.) I couldn't decide between the tawook (grilled chicken cubes) or the chicken shawarma so they suggested half and half. After having both I still can't really decide between the two because they were both delicious.\n\nAll the toppings were really fresh and I went with the sumac-onion-parsley blend turnip pickles and scallions which all worked really well with the chicken. For the sauces they spread on some garlic whip and added some hot sauce. Both were excellent especially the garlic whip one of my favorite things in Lebanese cuisine. To finish it all off they warmed the pita in the oven for a couple of minutes.\n\nI was so happy with the pita wrap that I have to figure out how to make it work in my schedule during the week to come here again. On top of all the customizable stuff they also have a refrigerated case with hummus and other dips and a hot appetizer section if you want something smaller or just a snack. Hoping to check that out another time as on this visit the pita was enough for lunch. Would definitely return here." u"So right after I wrote my initial review the business owner Roland reached out immediately to make things right by inviting me in for a free meal. I took him up on his offer and was welcomed with the biggest portion I've ever had.\n\nShoutout to Roland for making things whole and thanks to the manager on site for delivering. You guys didnt have to do this but you went beyond to satisfy a customer. You've won back my loyalty!" u"Quick service great price and great food. Can't  ask for a better lunch spot when you have an itch for some middle eastern food\n\nMy first Lebanese spot and the first place that I truly enjoyed eating falafels. \n\nI've tried this place three times as of today and won't be my last time. The Tawooka and falafels have me coming back for more." u'This is my favorite lunch spot-- lines are super quick and food is always fresh. I always get the chicken wrap with hummus and veggies. Their hummus is very tasty and their chicken is so fresh. I always pair this with their white sauce and hot sauce.' u'What a fantastic middle eastern mixin place to eat!\n\nNot only is the food here very affordable and they give you a great amount of portions but its also very delicious. The Sharma I tried here was both tender and juicy. The quality of the food here is honestly a lot better then other middle eastern places around Broadway. \n\nSeating wise this place is narrow but the times I have been here it never seem crowded. As for the service I have nothing to complain.\n\nSo far I think this place is the best middle eastern place in the area.' u"Very good Lebanese place with nice staff. One side is essentially build your own bowls (Chipotle) while the other side has some desserts some small bites and Lebanese manoushe (or lahmajoon/Lebanese pizza for me.) I was in the mood for something larger or else I would have gotten a manoushe from the other side.\n\nI got a kofta and chicken schwarma bowl with olives tomatoes some pickled vegetables and an onion mix. The sauces I got were the spicy sauce and the garlic whip. It was served over rice which was fluffy and flavorful. The meat was excellent with good spices and a good chew. Both of them were good. All of the vegetables were fresh and good though i think the onions could have had a stronger sour flavor from the sumac. It was worth it for the price though not for the extra vegetable.\n\nThe mouhalbie is a good dessert if you are looking for something to go. Make sure to grab a rose syrup on the side though as noted by them it's quite sweet so be careful with it. I got a Sifha to go as well. It's stuffed with ground beef tomatoes and a lot of spices such as pomegranate molasses and cinnamon. A bit too sweet but overall quite delicious and very cheap.\n\nGood mix of prices (cheap for the side stuff and the normal for the quality for the bowls. Great place. 4.6" u'Really good work lunch place! You get a lot of quantity for a great price. Recommend getting the "Your Way" Style with the Salad base Chicken Shawarma Fresh Veggies THEEE GARLICC WHIPPP if you don\'t plan to kiss someone after The Spicy Pepper sauce and Yogurt Cucumber Dip - Amazing combination and kept me full for the whole day.\n\nCheck it out and its super close to Bryant Park if you want to soak in some sun as you dine.' u"Found this place thru a coworker place is narrow and deep when u walk in very nice decor 9-10 tables along the wall. Service is super fast from beginning to end. Friendly staff and the best part is the food. They have a quick build menu to make it easy wrap bowl etc . You pick a meat and 4-5 toppings it's great. Food is Very filling lots flavor. I had the beef swarma with tahini sauce scallions cucumber tomatoes feta and hummus . Came to 9.75 plus tax. I was in and out..Great Mediterranean option near work. Only issue was my stomach wasn't agreeing with the food. Could be me I know they get an A rating from NYC.\nKeep up the good work!!" u"Had a lunch that totally satisfied my craving for manaeesh. I got the zaatar manousheh (Lebanese flatbread with zaatar spice) and I added tomatoes cucumber olives and labne have on top. The bread had a good density and chew and maintained a crisp exterior. The zaatar on top was perfect just enough of it good tang. The labne was well seasoned with salt a hint of garlic (maybe) and lemon.\n\nI had the kale tabouleh with 1 falafel piece and that was also really good. I was skeptical bc I'm typically a tabouli purist but the kale was chopped very finely and despite lacking the flavor punch that parsley gives it was a good substitute. The quinoa instead of bulgur was also a really healthy and clever substitution. Overall a very satisfying lunch!" u'This place was delicious. It\'s like the Mediterranean version of chipotle. You can choose whether you want your dish as a rice bowl salad bowl or pita wrap. The ingredients are very high quality; the chicken is moist and perfectly seasoned the vegetables are all very fresh and the sauces are delicious. I was reluctant to try the "garlic whip" but I\'m glad I did as it was amazing and packed with garlicky flavor. The portion sizes are large and my entire meal cost about $11 - not bad for manhattan! Last but certainly not least the atmosphere in this place is very cool. It\'s definitely Japanese-influenced filled with lots of plants and stone tables. I will definitely be coming back soon.' u'Probably the best and freshest tasting Mediterranean food in garment district. Their Zatar\nBread is fresh is really flavorful. We had it with cucumber and tatziki which was a perfect combination. We also got their chicken shawarma salad which was really nice too but what really made it stand apart was the flavor of the sauces and condiments with it- their hummus is some of the best out there with the prefect balance of tahini with garlic. Their roasted red pepper spicy sauce was especially mind blowing! It brought the salad together really well. Definitely a treasure among the usual spots in Garment District' u"Came here at 7PM on a weekday for a casual dinner with a friend. The place was empty when we arrived so we had the whole place to ourselves and picked the large beautiful table with couch bench seats. The table was very zen and it has live plants growing in the middle~\n\nThe staff was very friendly and I ordered the salad bowl with kafta and addition of two falafels. The guy said he would make the falafels fresh for me which was a plus! The portions are very generous and my salad platter was delicious. I ended up taking half of the food home because I couldn't finish everything with everything we ordered. My fried and I also ordered the manouche (I'm probably spelling this wrong) which is a pizza like flatbread. We got the tomato spicy one. It definitely has a kick with the pepper spicies but not too spicy. I actually put some of my babaganoush on top and ate it...which was yummy~ We also got to try their mini baklawa dessert pieces which was yummy. The dough could have been more crispy but the flavors were there and liked the pistachio pieces on the balawa.\n\nOverall a yummy casual place to sit down with a friend and enjoy a meal. We stayed for two hours just talking and munching. No need to worry about tipping leaving because of crowds or the other issues that come with a regular restaurant. Plus the decor is on point for a to go place~" u"This is the Chipotle version of Mediterranean food. You get to pick rice bowl wrap or salad. Then a protein chicken beef falafel etc. Then 4 different vegetables. Sauce to top it off. If you like you can even try half meat and half falafel at no extra charge. They just charge you for the meat price which is nice so you can try two different things out. The rice options are either white or brown. I usually go for the white. But it's different than your typical Chinese white rice. This is on the softer side. There's two kinds of chicken shawarma or kabab style. I usually go for the shawarma because it has more flavor and it much more moist. For vegetables there's a few options it's either raw or pickled. There's Hummus as well that counts as a vegetable. Pita comes on the side. \n\nThis is a nice place to eat if you want something healthy. \n\nIt's a small little store that has some seating but wouldn't recommend having a group or kids there. Just not enough space for everyone." u"Holy cow I'm in love! \nJust got in to NYC and checked into the hotel and we are starving. And they took care of us! Love it!" u"I just got the jebna manouche which is like a small cheese pizza with no sauce. It tastes really good and they bake it fresh right infront of you in a brick stone oven. Cost about $6 and is a reasonable price for portion size. \nDownside is that drinks are a bit pricey. \n\nWhen it comes to manouche - the Lebanese don't play. Definitly would be coming back just for it." u"It's been about 18 months since I first reviewed this wonderful establishment.  For the entire year-and-a-half their food has remained consistently excellent.  I should know because I eat there twice a week.  Doing the math I've had dinner there approximately 140 times!  My two favorites are the lamb and the Tawook chicken.  Their shwarma is delicious as are their sfiha and fatayer.  I've recommended this place to dozens of friends and every one of them has thanked me.  This is GREAT food!" u"I popped into Balade over the weekend for lunch.  Balade is another interesting take on fast food.  It is Lebanese-themed menu that makes wraps as well as bowls (orzo) and salads.  \n\nI opted for the chicken shawarma over salad.  It was pretty tasty.  It also came with lettuce and choice of toppings and sauces.  I added tomatoes and a few other things.  I added the garlic whipped sauce as a spicy sauce (can't remember the name of it).\n\nEverything was good.  I like the chicken shawarma at GRK better but this is pretty good.  The staff is very friendly and they helped me figure out the menu as it was my first time there.  \n\nBalade is a good alternative to the usual lunch spots if you are in the Penn Station / MSG area this is a good spot for you." u"Extremely friendly staff excellent food cool/trendy atmosphere... Can't ask for anything else. I ordered lamb falafel hummus zaatar and kibbeh. Meat is super juicy flavorful and had a wonderful bite yet tender. Falafel and kibbeh fried to perfection and tasty. Hummus is fresh and has a great lemony quality. All very reasonably priced.\n\nWhile I was eating the manager came up and asked how I was introduced himself and offered me some sauce to compliment my zaatar and some mouhalabie for dessert (milk pudding with pistachios and rose syrup). I'm no mouhalabie expert but it's pretty darn good. You control how sweet you want it since the syrup is on the side.\n\nThis has definitely become a goto for me when in the mood for Mediterranean food and that's pretty often." u'They have TOUM! \n\nI\'m so happy to have found this place within walking distance from my office. Lebanese food is universally loved and they have all the good stuff here including their signature tender rice with vermicelli tabbouleh and TOUM. If you love garlic get the TOUM (which they appropriately call "garlic whip"). It is exactly that and SO delicious. \n\nI ordered a shish tawook rice bowl and it came with so many sides thy perfectly complimented all the flavors of the chicken toum and their outrageously good spicy red pepper sauce. I\'m the kind of person who asks for my sauces on the side but I wanted the red pepper sauce on everything. It has a good kick but isn\'t too spicy. \n\nThe only reason they don\'t get 5 stars is because some of the pieces of chicken that I had were *really* tough and rubbery and some looked like they were more than a couple of days old which explained the toughness. If they improved on that then 5 stars all the way!' u'Great falafel and shawarma. I came in the evening so there was no line but I can imagine it gets pretty packed in here. Nice to have this option in what is otherwise mostly a midtown food desert. Good prices too.'],0.4404,0.592,0.408,0.0
37.Vida Verde,[u"Really cool place my husband and I wandered into walking home from our post-late night show with Stephen Colbert date night. \n\nWe read the menu at the window and we're intrigued by the unique items you normally wouldn't see on a Mexican menu. \n\nJulia was our server and she was absolutely awesome! she gave us great suggestions from drinks to desserts she was attentive and also gave us tips around town. (Julia if you're reading this we checked out the botanical garden and it was one of our favorite highlights of our trip thank you!) \n\n We order the tamarindo mezcal drink shrimp tacos tlayuda (Oaxaca cuisine pizza) with duck..so unique....I've never seen this item anywhere on a Mexican menu and I was happy to see it get respect. Oaxaca is one of my favorite places in Mexico and it is know for its unique Mexican cuisine. Check out the pictures for the delicious food we ordered. \n\n Over all My hubby and I had a wonderful late night at this place. Would totally come back. Worth every penny. Save room for dessert! Request Julia!" u'If you are starving I do not recommend Vida Verde for dinner.\n\nPortions are minuscule!! They coin themselves a tapas restaurant but offer entrees on their menu. The entrees are not entree sizes only entree prices. Eat somewhere before and come here for a snack.\n\nOn the positive side the service was super attentive friendly and they really went above and beyond to accommodate us!' u'High hopes and a nice atmosphere there. Take the water glasses and very nice tasting water. Also the bathroom was nice and the floor tiles were cool.\n\nWe were excited by the mushroom quesadillas and yucca fries with green beans a miss and a hit respectively. The food all looked great.\n\nWe also had a salad which was a little too ground up for our tastes but had good flavor and a very meager portion of guacamole and chips both very tasty.\n\nThe droppers of hot sauce were unexplained and not ideal. All around this concept needs a little tweaking.\n\nIf we return we will try different items and have a drink. But so many other places probably a longshot to return.' u"We had a Team Happy Hour and the criteria to finding a restaurant that night was as follows: small plates / family style not in Times Square but in Midtown and good margaritas. This was an excellent choice and props to a team member for the suggested venue. \n\nThe vibe was chill and a bit more dark and intimate. It is definitely a great place for a date or just a casual night out with the friends. It's trendy but elegant and has a simple and delicious menu to go with it. \n\nOrdered \n- Molote Chicken Skewer (4/5). This was delicious and simple. It tastes like any other skewer (egg-rolly aroma) but a good starter\n\n- Broccoli Tamales (2.5/5). It is a nostalgic dish and reminds me of my childhood growing up in an Asian household. I was familiar with the shape and presentation but the actual tasting was not so pleasant. I usually like broccoli but it wasn't that good packed in the glutinous dough\n\n- Table-side Guacamole (5/5). I love this and it is freshly made by the server and goes so well with the crunchy house tortilla chips. Well done\n\n- Assorted Tacos (4/5). We tried the NY steak chorizo and shrimp types. It was pretty good but nothing too differentiating. The green sauce that came with it didn't do much\n\n- Wings (5/5). Amazing. Ordered both the habanero and regular flavored wings but I have to go with the spicy version. The sauce is super thick and is absorbed by the wings. You will get messy eating this but it is amazing. This goes very well with a nice gin and tonic or drink. The habanero is also spicy but not Halal Guys spicy so you will be able to appreciate it \n\nVV is awesome and a place I would return too again. My only comment is to work on the customer service. It was about 95% good for most of the night but near the end we had empty glasses that needed refilling of water or lack of napkins. Minor things so I had a great experience nonetheless!" u"The home of the best guac I've ever had. It was mind-blowing. We ordered a handful of other dishes too and almost all were quite good. The guac came with droppers full of extra sauce (Chipotle hot sauce) so you could choose your own adventure but all were magnificent. The other dishes were mostly terrific: the chicken skewers underperformed feeling like a gooey dough around chicken but the mushroom thing was amazing. \n\nThe place was a little loud but the music was good. Definitely a bit of a scene - good energy. The waiter was friendly helpful attentive did things right. \n\nWe found this spot via Yelp - thanks team! Good call." u"Came here for Brunch with my favorite foodie and the inlaws before a Broadway show. \n4.5 stars for this must dine experience. Most don't think about Brunch at a Mexican spot but you should. Unique blend of a typical brunch but with a Latin flare. For starters we ordered the loaded guacamole. It was just okay. To much stuff... Then we ordered the table side guacamole - much better. For our entrees we ordered the pork belly and egg brunch special- 4.5 stars; the steak fajitas -4.5 stars; the in-laws had the papa chorizo dish and one of the hangover specials (sorry not exact  names ). Overall the food was delicious.  Ambiance is tasteful and festive but without the cheesy sombero decor. Drinks flowed too. Pictures incl." u'Delicious food! We ordered a huge assortment of tacos pork & tortillas ceviche... all were delicious! \n\nAmazing cocktails too.\n\nVery very very loud.' u"Good place to get a drink and small bites to eat. The guacamole is good and served with warm tortillas and chips. The salsa is served in a test tube style apparatus. It looks cute but is a little annoying to use. The salsa tasted good though. \n\nI had the inside out mushroom quesadilla. It's sort of like a quesadilla that's decided to explode. The dish was tasty but honestly I prefer an inside-in quesadilla. But it's easy and fun to share due to the distributed nature of its contents. \n\nMy fellow diners got fish skewers and shrimp tacos. Both of these had superb presentation and they were served with some tasty salsa/sauces. The opinion on taste was that it looked better than it tasted. \n\nService was A-grade. If you're a vegetarian like yours truly I'd say don't expect too much enjoy the ambience and the company. \n\nP.S. They have tiny water glasses which they were refilling every 37 seconds! Why?? Why not just have regular sized glasses!" u"Really enjoy the food and atmosphere! They were very accommodating to my diet. They allowed me to sub lettuce for their corn tortillas in the tacos. The squid taco is amazing even without the tortilla. My friend said the spicy margarita was one of the best she's had!! Will return when diet is over!!!" u'Still sitting at the table after a wonderful meal. Loved the presentation of our empanadas and tacos. Flavors were outstanding. Loved the chipotle sauce and the habernero was spicy for real. Our server Jorge was expectional. His menu knowledge and guidance of what to order with what sides and drinks was perfect. His service was polishedcrisp and professional all while being polite and friendly.\nI highly recommend this restaurant.' u"It's tough to find good Mexican food in New York especially when you're from LA. This is definitely an excellent Mexican restaurant. It was not only fantastic in taste but it had a very unique flavor. The food the ambiance the vibe the service and the location are up to par. The chef Hugo which we had the pleasure of meeting was very generous and stopped by to check on us. I would definitely recommend this place! Get the ceviche the Guac and the pork belly." u"Came here for the first time and I'm already loving this place especially with this carism\xe1tico Barteder mane Azuca Aaron the minute I came he made me feel like family I definitely recommend this spot for all the folks that love to feel loved  to feel like family Aaron I s the guy you need to meet." u'The drinks were AMAZING! Atmosphere A+ the only thing lacking was that the food was missing some sort of spice/flavor. \nDefinitely a great spot for afterwork drinks or pre dinner cocktails. Must try: the beet-carrot margarita!' u'I am here with my best friend for my birthday.  The foods are great but too dark and music is good but kind of loud.  The service is great.  Will come back again' u"Way too expensive. The drinks were pretty good and at nyc prices... I do recommend their Verde cocktail. It's not very sweet and you taste the lime cutting thru the alcohol. \nUpstairs bar is much more chill to hang out.\nDid not try their food because the price turned me away. I hope it was good- looked like people enjoyed their meal." u'Great and relatively new place. \nGood and fresh food (guacamole made at the table) colorful space and reasonable prices.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch and was perfect.' u"Came hear after Broadway Show. The restaurant is very modern and trendy . The waiter was very nice. Prices are a little bit high but the food was very good  . Had the loaded guacamole . Fried yucca Chicken nachos and Vida Verde Margarita If you don't mind the price it's a very nice atmosphere and well worth it for the music and ambiance" u'Lovely new place .\nDrinks were so so music was good .not much to say bartender was ok yet not to attentive especially since there were only 8 people at the bar.\nNot sure if I will return though .' u"Three friends and I flew in to NYC for the week to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Last night we decided to start off the night with dinner and drinks at Vida Verde.  It was definitely a great decision.\n\nWe started off with chips and guacamole.  Most restaurant chips have an overwhelming amount of salt. At Vida Verde though they got it just right with the perfect amount.  The guacamole was fresh tangy and delicious.  Also the drinks (mojitos and rum & cokes) were fantastic.\n\nAs far as service it was excellent!  Nathalie the hostess greeted us warmly with her pretty smile.  She took the time to chat with us and answer our questions about local clubs we were curious about.  We appreciated her friendliness immensely!  Our waiter was also a great guy.  He was cool enough to bring the birthday boy in our group a plate with pastel de tres leches and other sweets.  Good dude." u"Loved it. Food was amazing and the service exceptional. The draft cocktails are an excellent idea and the place was super cool. They played great music too. I can't wait to go back and try something else. Definitely recommend"],0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0
209.Thalia,[u'Had a lovely leisurely dinner here on a Saturday night. It was crowded at 7:15 but thinned out as people left for the theater. We three were tired after a long flight & then rehearsals so really enjoyed the quiet and not feeling rushed. \nWe each had a drink before dinner. My friend loved her Chardonnay & I thought the "Field Day" was both delicious and a hoot with its graham cracker rimmed glass! Also perfect for a hot summer evening. Our other friend ordered the Mistinguett but found it a strange and unappealing combination of flavors.\nWe all ordered appetizers instead of entrees and had plenty to eat. The lobster bisque was a rich & creamy pur\xe9e redolent of lobster. I thought the Andouille sausage would overpower the PEI mussels but not so. It added a complimentary smokiness. The roasted beets & accompaniments were delicious with fun presentation. The fricassee of mushrooms & the arugula/watercress salad also got rave reviews. We finished the evening by splitting a warm rich chocolate dessert and went away satisfied in every way.\nOur waiter was friendly knowledgeable and did a great job. \nI\'m only here for a few more days but I\'d love to return to Thalia\'s to try to their lunch &                 brunch offerings! Highly recomended!' u"Came here for $1 oyster happy hour because they have a later happy hour than most other places. There were plenty of seats available during dinner time on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 dozen oysters and got 4 that were just straight up rotten. The other oysters are very creamy in an odd way. Their port wine is good definitely try it if you go.\n\nI'm not sure how the rest of their food fares since we only got oysters and drinks but I would avoid the oysters if you come here. The ambiance is nice for a casual date." u"At about 6:40 we wandered into Thalia hoping to get a quick meal even though we know to always avoid corner restaurants in the theater district.  I was in full panic mode because I hate being late and I was worried we wouldn't make it to the theater in time but we were in and out of Thalia in an hour.\n\nThe place is large and is hopping before a show.  We sat in a cozy booth and enjoyed it.  Don't forget to look up--the light fixtures are really cool!\n\nWe were disappointed because none of the taps were working on Saturday night and all of the bottle options were tired (Corona Heineken Budweiser Blue Moon). Sorry I'm not paying $8 for a bottle fo Blue Moon.\n\nI ordered the mussels which were excellent.  My friends ordered a salad fries oysters and the chicken.  The food was good but unremarkable.  The oyster deal is a little deceiving since it doesn't start until 7 or 8." u'Dinner at Thalia last night was like a Laurel and Hardy skit -- you know -- who\'s on first what\'s on second -- Tower of Babel stuff.  \n\nWe walked in on a Wednesday night without reservations 90 minutes before our curtain -- were seated in a very comfortable corner table -- bar side -- and told by our server and the Manager that dinner would be served in time for us to make our show -- "we\'ve been doing this a long time" said the manager -- and "we know how to get our customers to make curtains."\n\nSo far -- so good.\n\n45 mins later we were still waiting on our appetizers -- simple dishes like ceviche and mussels in a broth.  The ceviche was mostly lime juice and veggies -- you\'d need a microscope to spot seafood (at $16) -- but the mussels were well prepared -- fresh shellfish in a spicy and perfectly seasoned broth -- with decent bread for mopping.\n\nAn hour after being seated -- still no mains.  Our waitress disappeared.  The gentleman bussing tables spoke little English and looked confused when we gestured about our lack of food. The manager made all sorts of hand gestures from a distance suggesting the food was on its way -- and still no dinner.\n\nWTF??\n\nWhen the food arrived -- 25 mins before our curtain -- my salmon was raw inside and the brussels sprouts were hard -- like chewing on pebbles.  I sent it back.  The manager apologized and within minutes -- a new dish of salmon (properly cooked) appeared -- but with the same veggie flaws.  They took my utensils with the raw fish dish -- which sent me scouring for new ones (not easily found) taking up even more time. The manager apologized again -- said he yelled at the kitchen staff -- and did not charge us for the salmon dinner.\n\nSweetie suggested this place because she worked across the street for years and remembers the service and food differently from our experience last night.  I can\'t recommend Thalia for a pre-show meal folks unless you want to risk the stress of a long wait and kitchen miscues.\n\nThalia is a busy place -- right smack dad in tourist alley and it may be unreasonable of me to expect good food and good service -- but then again -- why not.  \n\nShould\'ve ordered the $1 oysters like all the other Yelp reviewers suggested.  Hard to screw that up.' u"Good spot for happy hour. The sign outside was a bit misleading as it stated that the happy hour was 50% off wine beer and cocktails in the lounge as well as $1 oysters. It was just $1 oysters Im guessing the drink specials were only 3 until 7 or 8 and then after 10pm only the $1 oysters.\nAt any rate the ambiance and music are very 90's so that was fun! Server was nice very goodlooking staff here. The oysters were good for what you pay. The calamari was below average...the menu described it as having peppers in it...there were none and it was a bit freezer burned. All around a nice evening its just next door so will be back!" u"I went to Thalia with a few friends on Friday night and had a really nice experience. My friends are perpetually late to everything so I ended up having to change my reservation a couple times but the staff was super friendly and accommodating.\n\nWe ordered the burrata to start and it was fantastic- even echoed by my friends who are picky eaters so much so that we ordered another plate after devouring the first. I ordered the scallops as my entree and it was also very delicious. I was a bit disappointed that for the price I only got 3 (albeit large) pieces. It was set on top of a tasty carrot pur\xe9e that I was skeptical of at first but turned out to be quite nice. My friends ordered the squid ink capellini ahi tuna and mushroom ravioli. All of the picky eaters rejoiced! \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the meal and the prices were very reasonable considering the quality. Definitely a place to keep in mind if you're in the theater district." u"I don't know why this place doesn't have a full 4 stars. We had a 5:30 reservation (to make a 8pm show) and we were a little late. We were seated right away and the restaurant was already pretty packed. I saw online they had a theater prix fixe but we didn't receive that menu but didn't plan to order off of it anyway.\n\nWe ordered 6 Blue Point (keeping it local!) oysters and the crab cake ($17 yikes!). I had the prime rib with a side of spinach & my husband had the mushroom ravioli.\n\nOur server was great! Quick & attentive and asked before we ordered what time our show was so he could get us out on time." u"This place is OK. The atmosphere is definitely nice and it has a very upscale feel. However the menu is pretty limited and VERY overpriced.\n\nI called into the restaurant beforehand and asked about $1 oysters and they said they were available after 8PM. It turns out however that they are $1.50 oysters instead. Not a huge deal but just something to be careful of.\n\nMy friends and I ordered half a dozen oysters some beers and I ordered the lobster bisque. The $1.50 oysters are chefs pick so I guess they are different each day. The day we went they had a type of east coast oysters. They were juicy and meaty but definitely too salty. This is personal preference though so I guess it can't be helped.\n\nMy lobster bisque was actually really good! However at $11 I would not buy it again. I didn't try to beer but my one friend got a dark beer and he was raving about how good it was so I assume their beers are pretty good. \n\nThe service was also very slow. The restaurant didn't seem too crowded when I went at 8-9 PM but our waitress never seemed to be around. She also brought us the bread that you usually get at the start at the very end of our meal which confused me." u'I stopped in tonight for a drink and an app after a long day at work.  The bartender Sean was amazing! He recommended the perfect glass of wine to go with my calamari.  I loved the drink food and felt very "cared for!  I highly recommend Thalia\'s for a drink or meal before the theater or after a long day!' u"My friend and I came here before a show after striking out at several places because they were so full. Thalia was also pretty full but they served us in the bar area. The area is very cramped and pretty uncomfortable but I get it they're trying to get as much bang for their buck as they can. The hostess was very on top of finding out if we have a show and what time the show started. She passed this information along to our server.\n\nThe prices threw me quite a bit when I looked at the menu. They are pretty high. My friend and I split the burrata appetizer which was $17. We couldn't believe i was so expensive but we just figured we are in the theater district it's going to be pricey. The burrata came with roasted red peppers reduced balsamic roasted tomatoes and pesto. Honestly it was worth the price with everything else that came along with it. It was absolutely delicious. \n\nAs an entree I got the mushroom risotto and my friend got the spaghetti with marinara. Both were excellent. The risotto was cheesy and full of truffle flavor. It was quite good. The pasta was also great. The marinara had great flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly. \n\nThis is a good pre-theater option albeit expensive. I would recommend making a reservation before going. It was very full when we went." u"This is my go-to spot in the theater district to meet up with people or kill time. \n\nFirst of all the oyster happy hour (there's an afternoon AND an evening happy hour!) is fantastic. Service is great. There's something for everyone -- apps entrees tea service great drinks whatever. It makes it really easy to please everyone in your group.\n\nAlso -- seriously an OYSTER HAPPY HOUR. Dollar oysters. In a lovely restaurant. After a show. What could be better?!? Add prosecco and call it a night!!!" u"Okay we had arrived in New York City and we were on a mission.  Cram as much shopping and as many restaurants as you possibly can in four days.  We dropped off our luggage at 6:30AM ate a buffet breakfast at our hotel and then we hit the streets like shopping addicts.  After all of that power shopping we were exhausted and hungry.  We really didn't want to stray too far from our hotel or eat at our hotel again in one day.  Concierge to the rescue!  Restaurant Thalia was one of her suggestions and barely a block away.  We looked at the menu online and decided to make a move.\n\nLovely interior and lovely service from the beginning to the end. Because we arrived relatively early in the evening before the theatre crowd we were able to make reservations easily.  Once seated our wonderful waiter took our drink orders and brought us a house-made bread basket and olive spread.  I'm a sucker for bread and so is my family. (I think that my daughter and tried to OD on bread and olive spread.  My sister showed some restraint because she was ordering a burger served on bread.)  That bread and spread rocked!\nBecause we were hungry we did not play around with the menu.  Here's what we ordered:\n\nMe - Prix Fixe menu - Lobster Bisque with sweet corn Roasted Half Free Range Chicken house-made lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscotti\nMuff - Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu baby arugula tomatoes and celena cheese\nLuch - Thalia Burger - grass fed beef gruyere cheese bacon lettuce tomato onion sesame brioche bun herb fries\n\nThe lobster bisque didn't have a lot large chunks of lobster but what it lacked in lobster pieces it made up for in flavor and restaurants can and should be judged by their roasted chicken  Thalia's was superb with crispy skin and moist insides.  Yummy!  And I am not a dessert girl but the lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscotti were outstanding.  I tasted my daughter's Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu and she almost didn't get her plate back.  My sister also thoroughly enjoyed her burger and fries.\n\nFrom the d\xe9cor to the service to the food we were well pleased with our visit to Thalia!" u"The service was just slower then expected. Maybe the girl was new but whatever the case almost 1 hr wasted for 2 drinks in which we didn't even get the right ones. The oysters were good but the bus boy could not even smile nor present a facial feature that could incline toward customer service. Then took forever to get our bill which was improperly billed since it was happy hour yet we got charged filled price. I didn't want to argue at that point because it would have wasted even more time then I could have wanted." u"I went to Thalia for lunch with my brother and mother during the time their lounge menu was being served. \n\nWe sat in the lounge and the the tables were very small. The booth was legitimately mini sized and we barely fit on the chairs. The rest of the decor was pretty but nothing over the top.\n\nWe had a few small plates to share. The margarita pizza was average. The crab cake was delicious; the mango salsa was on point. The lobster bisque was not traditional and it didn't taste good.\n\nOverall the experience was not a memorable one." u"My boyfriend and I entered the Wicked Lottery at the Gershwin Theatre down the street (spoiler: we won!) so while waiting for the winners to be called we stopped by Thalia for a quick drink. It's perfectly located for theater goers like us. Unfortunately we didn't get to try any of the food but the bubbly that the bartender recommended was delicious! \n\nI like that it's not too cramped or crowded or at least during the time of day we were there. The bartender was in no rush which contributed to the laid back but slightly upscale vibe. I was some signs for oysters specials (!!!) so I'd want to check that out next time. Happy hour or dinner this seems like a great place to hang out as you're in the area enjoying a Broadway show." u"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and decided to come for a birthday. Decor was fun to look at staff was warm and accomodating but the cold bread complimentary appetizer dinner and cocktails were a little disappointing for me. My favorites of the night were the mushroom ravioli and wine. I usually like to order dessert but chose not to. It might vary based on what you order." u"So we decided to try this place again as our first time was after more than a few drinks and we partook in the ouster special. Back in town and in the mood for oysters again. So we Came back here on a Friday night for the $1 oysters.  Got 2 dozen. Amazing deal and the oysters were good!!!  Almost got 2 dozen more but alas dinner was coming. My partner ordered the squid ink pasta which was amazingly good.  And I had the seared sea bass special on arugula salad with a cold corn salad made with poblano peppers and mango. Let's just say both dishes were gone in 5 minutes. Wait staff was attentive but not intrusive.  Atmosphere is nice. Not too loud. Will definitely come back again" u"Ordered the squid ink capellini and lobster mac 'n cheese. \n\nMaybe it was because I was really hungry but I really enjoyed the capellini. I inhaled it. The pasta was a lot spicier than I thought and you can't taste the squid flavour in the pasta that much but the amount of seafood totally made up for it.\n\nI only had a bite of the mac 'n cheese so can't really comment on that.\n\nAlso I liked the crushed olives with olive oil sauce/paste that comes with the bread. It's a fun twist. \n\nService was unfortunately slow and poor." u"We were in a rush near theater district and stumbled upon Thalia. We were at first seated next to a man speaking into his hand and almost walked out. \n\nAs we got up the manager Miguel came over to help us and was fabulous. He got us seated at a great table in the lounge took our drink order and got them right to us. Food came out at a nice pace as well and was really quite good.\n\nOne of the drinks wasn't exactly what we thought it would be and without us even asking the waitress noticed it and said don't worry i'll get you something else or just take it off the bill. So thoughtful!\n\nThanks to Miguel and his crew for making this a nice experience. We would definitely go back?" u"Came here with a few friends from out of town for the $1 oyster happy hour. \nI had called earlier and and asked which oysters they were serving one from the east one from the west coast. \nWhen we sat down we asked the server which oysters and she didn't know. Neither did the second server they sent over. \nAssuming there was going to be two different oysters we each ordered a dozen.\nWhen they placed the oysters in front of us there was no denying that they all were the same west cost oyster. \nThe oysters were fine mostly medium sized and briney.\nWhen we asked for the check we noticed that the tip was included although the server did not tell us and there were no markings highlighting the tip on the check.\nThis really upset one of my guests but we paid anyway.\nI don't think we will go back..."],-0.2838,0.025,0.913,0.062
75.Toloache 50,[u'Words cannot express how satisfied I am with this Mexican restaurant. It is difficult to find a Mexican restaurant where the ingredients taste fresh and homey. Every dish I habe tried has left me begging for more!\n\nThe drinks are also very well made the margaritas most especially. The servers are always nice and very attentive. \n\nIt is a good place to watch sports and have a great time with your loved ones or friends. Great place to bring someone who wants to have a good birthday celebration.' u"Great food. This place is worth visiting just for its desserts. I had cinnamon tart with coconut ice cream and churros. Churros were good but not exceptional but the tart was thin crust perfectly cooked with loads of cinnamon served with a serve of coconut icecream which was also good. Must eat. \n\nFor mains I had the vegetarian enchilada which was really good. My friends had lobster taco chicken Toloache and they couldn't stop raving about their food." u'Dining in and around times square is almost like a challenge! With a 4 star average review status Toloache seemed like a good enough choice. \n\nWe came in during a weekend afternoon but were seated right away inspite of not making reservations with a 5 people group. The restaurant seemed quite full. We had to start with a guacamole because well who is not a guac fan! We tried the fruit guacamole which had mangoes chillies and pomegranate. It was quite unique and flavorful!\n\nWe ordered the mushroom & cactus tacos truffle quesadilla fish tacos and chicken quesadilla. Now the food was in general not very flavorful being a mexican place- reason being its right in the middle of times square and thus is super tourist oriented & thus quite bland. The portions were quite small too! I have never left a mexican place hungry until here. The tacos had 2 corn tortillas and a portion of rice and beans. I wanted maybe 1 more taco to feel full. The quesadilla was quite small in size too!\n\nThe service was friendly and the waitstaff answered all questions about the menu (which had a lot of names in espanol).\n\nSo well we have decided to only eat burgers (maybe shake shack & the counter) when in times square :)' u"Coming from Texas I wasn't sure if I would fine really great Mexican food so far from the south but Toloache came through. We visited for dinner and they sat us upstairs in a cozy booth. The lights were low the music was loud it was a fun party atmosphere. \n\nWe started with the guacamole which was outstanding. So fresh and full of flavor. We scraped the bowl clean with our chips. For our meal we shared a few dishes including the jicama salad the veggie tacos the fish tacos and the brussels sprouts and all of it was delicious. The veggie tacos were especially popular although I adored the fish tacos. I also had a mojito that was truly excellent. Well done New York you do everything (including Mexican food) very well." u"This place usually has a bit of a wait during peak dinner hours. However we made a reservation morning of and were able to get a table for 2 at 6:15. We ended up just sitting at the bar though after grabbing cocktails because we got their early. \n\nIt's a bit of a cramped space but what NYC restaurant isn't? It's dimly lit and has an upstairs with additional seating. \n\nThey have an extensive drink menu. I got La Tropical Margarita which was as fruity as it was tasty! Lots of flavors I could've definitely had a few...\n\nWe ordered the La Roja guacamole which was labeled the spiciest out of all 3 kinds. However it wasn't spicy at all. Served with a good helping of warm chips and salsa. Also ordered a side of plantains which were delicious and sweet and not soggy! Had the shrimp taco as well which was pretty tasty but had too many juices so that it broke the tortilla underneath making it hard to eat." u"Definitely some of the best Mexican food I've had in a while.  Had some really great drinks and some pretty decent service as well. I had  the taco special which was surf & turf. I'll give that a five-star. I only dropped one star on this location because although we were a large group in there a while towards the end we thought rushed despite having a very significant bill. However certainly not enough that I would never go back." u"I've sat both at the bar for drinks and at a table for dinner. At the bar the bartender was very nice and helpful and attentive. The frutas guac is awesome! I never would've expected those ingredients combined being yummy but they are. The margaritas I tried were nice as well. Sitting at a table for dinner I found the waiter to be a little pushy in ordering quickly and getting appetizers or additional food. The tacos were great. The bathrooms are clean." u"Not bad. Atmosphere is great - cozy inviting and romantic but also excellent to hang at with friends - but food is highly overpriced. I got the hamachi ceviche which was a tiny portion but solid. I get it's NYC and tourists will pay but damn did I just pay $23 for mediocre ceviche?" u"We've dined at Toloache in the Theatre District a couple of times.  Very nice place great food and excellent tequila-based cocktails!\n\nRecommended Dishes:\nGuacamole-all three are good but I'd say go with the Frutas and get a side of habanero salsa\nTacos-camaron and pescado are both amazing\nEnchiladas\nFried Brussels Sprouts\nSpicy Saut\xe9ed Kale\nSweet Plantains" u'Amazing place in a place you would never expect to find some of the best Mexican cuisine this side of the wall that Trump will never build!\nService is excellent and the food even better!\nChef Medina is a genius.\nEat here and you will be hooked!' u'I\'m always searching for the best mexican food and every time I dine at a new mexican restaurant I have to try the enchiladas.\n\nI reviewed the menu and settled on the Enchiladas Borrachas which were simple but amazing with shredded chicken mexican cheese crema and a smoky red sauce.   The sweet plantains I ordered for an appetizer were crisp on the edges and not greasy as some plantains can be.  \n\nThe "El Manguito" mezcalita cocktail is something I still fantasize about.  This masterpiece was crafted with mezcal Remy Martin chipotle-infused mango and tamarind.  Sweet tangy spicy...glorious.  I intended on just ordering one but I ended up having two.\n\nI didn\'t think I had room for dessert but I looked at the menu anyway because I always make an exception for flan.  \n\nToloache\'s flan was drizzled in raspberry sauce and dressed with caramel popcorn and a fresh flower.  I can\'t remember having a more perfect dessert before.\n \nI recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious upscale Mexican food in NYC.' u"Toloache has the best tacos I've tasted! Definitely get the JM Chapulines (Oaxacan-style dried grasshoppers). They taste like potato chips. De Lechon (Suckling pig carnitas) was also wonderful. Service was great and fast! Highly recommended! \n\nSee photos below." u'Excellent all around.  Clearly fresh ingredients and awesome service.  Great time and great food!' u"Toloache catered an event for my company so I didn't actually go to the restaurant.\n\nStaff was friendly.\n\nWe tried several things:\nChicken taco - very watery but tasty\nBrisket taco - again very watery. the tortilla barely held up. meat was good!\n\nThey really should just fix the watery taco issue because other than that everything was good...\n\nGuac and chips - good... guac was alright but it had this weird taste like it was in a container...idk how to describe it\nSalad - good had a light dressing on it\nRice - yum cooked well\n\nOverall decent experience" u"Solid Mexican place in Hell's Kitchen. As a vegetarian we got the guacamole (average) vegetarian enchiladas (better than average) and the mushroom cheese tacos (average). Th ambience is lovely great for pre-theater dinner. Margaritas were also pretty good. My 2nd round was a bit on the salty side. The food was decent the ambiance was lovely and the location is great." u"Great lunchtime pick in Midtown. One of my NYC reps had a planned business lunch meeting and her clients wanted to come here. I was lucky enough to be in town when they scheduled. Definitely has the NYC feel as it's a little cramped inside and as a southwesterner I like my space. It was also loud at times because I think of the wood interior and nothing really to absorb all conversations.\n\nWe had a reservation set up on the upper level in a corner perfect to have business talk and our laptops open. Our server was great though- he really knew the menu in and out and kept our water glasses full. The four of us split guac and chips- definitely a great appetizer! My Ensalada Picada was a perfect lunch-size salad and they didn't skimp on protein as restaurants can sometimes do for salads. If you're feeling saucy at lunch get a mojito. It'll do you some good." u"Food was ok but very small portions.  We were seated right away however service was slow.  It was raining that day I happened to notice everyone that came in was welcomed a lot differently than we were.  Their umbrellas were taken from them and put in a plastic bag and were offered to help with their jackets however we were definitely not offered that at all.   We placed an order for mimosas and after waiting for almost 20 mins we asked about it and were told the waitress forgot.  Mind you it wasn't busy at the time we went in.  And we still didn't even receive our apps that we ordered.  When they finally brought he mimosas it was the wrong one.   The hostess kept looking at us the whole time making it very uncomfortable for me and my friend.  I hate to say it but I think it was because I am a minority.  The rest of the clients weren't.  Unfortunately I did notice the difference in service.  Which makes no sense since the hostess and waitress were minorities as well.  They didn't even offer us to pay for the mimosas since it took almost 30-45 mins  total to get the right one barely an apology.  Not impressed with service.  Again food was good and decor very nice." u"This is a great stop for Mexican cuisine in Manhattan. The presentation was fantastic and the margaritas were very tasty as well. Enjoyed the variety of items on the menu and the guacamole was some of the best I've had in NY. Enchiladas Borrachas is what I would recommend. Service was a little slow which can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. Overall would recommend." u"Came here for drinks. Cute place bartender was friendly and attentive. The spicy margaritas were DELICIOUS!! Can't wait to go back and try the food." u"My friend and I came here on a Sunday night at around 4pm after a show nearby. We were told that the upstairs area would open at 5pm and that we were allowed to wait at the bar. Since there was only the two of us we decided the bar was more than spacious enough to stay at for the night.\n\nI started off with the red wine sangria and thought it was amazing. They have a huge selection of drinks and the servers are equipped with the knowledge to recommend you something that you'll definitely love. After getting a peligrosa my friend and I asked for a recommendation and the server made us our very own special cocktail which was delicious!\n\nI'm not a super big fan of tacos but really enjoyed the ones we had here. We weren't super hungry so we decided to just go with the Los Tacos appetizer size (two tacos per plate). I ordered the costilla & tuetano (beef short rib & bone marrow) and it was so great! The server made sure to let us know that it's a cult favorite. The sauce was so savory and complimented the tender ribs. I also had the pescado (baja-styled fluke) which was pretty good but not as great as the other.\n\nThe service here is great and the bartenders and servers were amazing and attentive. Although this is a bit out of the way for me I'd love to come back to try the other tacos!"],0.6696,0.191,0.809,0.0
132.Guy’s American Kitchen and Bar,[u"Food wasn't terrible but there also was not too many options. I wanted a soda but the waitress informed me that they do not offer free refills and would charge full price if I wanted another one... who does that? \nI ordered the pretzel chicken tenders they weren't bad but nothing to write home about. \nThe service was awesome! Our waitress was attentive and very friendly!" u'I think Guy Fieri gets a bad rap. \n\nYou may not like the way he dresses or his hair or his cars or his penchant for saying things like "slamma-jamma" and you may think that although he claims to be the Mayor of Flavortown he\'s actually the Sultan of Douchebagistan.\n\nThat\'s your opinion and you\'re entitled to it.\n\nMy opinion is definitely influenced by the fact that I once spent about 40 minutes in his company once. From what I saw he is down-to-earth generous with his many devoted fans and a genuinely nice guy. But more than that he\'s made a career out of highlighting and helping* great local joints that make real food. There are worse people out there.\n\nAll that said this restaurant pretty much gets the rap it deserves.\n\nIf you find yourself here because of poor decisions with regard to your friends family or anything else your best bet is to just drink beer. Because they made mac and cheese taste bad somehow. \n\nIf you are unbearably hungry I\'d stick to fried things (although the chicken tenders have "awesome" in quotes for a reason). Much like your local Applebee\'s the wings will be fine nachos are tough to screw up too bad and fries are fries. \n\nYou can probably do worse if you\'re over there to see The Lion King but I\'m not 100% sure of that.  \n___________\n\n*Apparently he brings a 200% increase in business with him: https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/guy-fieri-diners-drive-ins-dives-behind-scenes' u'Our last night in New York and "Guy sent us to the back of the bus." We were seated in the way back with nobody else there.  Everyone else was seated in the front and they continued to seat people in the front.  Our waitress ditched us....probably forgot we were hidden back there.  We got another waiter  who was awesome (Mitchell).\nWe came in specifically because we got a free beer with order.  SUCKER I am for a coupon.  Sadly the my husband beer(Hef and Independence) and Mitchell was the only good thing about the dinner.\n\nWe had: \nRotisserie lemon rosemary chicken that was dry and could hardly taste the seasonings.  Veggies were good NOT the mushrooms.  I think they came from the bottom of a shoe.\nGreen salad to start that only had oil for dressing.\nMac cheese burger that needed more cheese and the burger was dry.\nWomen\'s bathroom had 2 disgusting filled toilets another with pee all over and trash all over.  I wish I had taken a pic because nobody would believe it.  Tell me why there is a TV in the bathroom right when you walk in?  You can only see it right when you walk in and block the door.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:  I felt a little bad giving the homeless guy our leftovers.' u"We were looking for something other than pizza. Thought we would check out Guy's. I love watching Guy on triple D and so this was great for me. \n\nWe split the pulled pork sliders. They were amazing!!! Had a few local brews which were good. The place was kinda slow so we sat at the bar. The barkeep was friendly and suggested a few places for us to check out. So we were able to get to... some are on the list for next trip. But this is on the list for the next trip with the family!" u'We had some time to kill in Time Square so we decided to look for a place to eat. Knowing that it\'s a super touristy area and rent would be through the roof I didn\'t have much expectation for good quality food. Guy\'s American Kitchen and Bar is exactly what you find at a tourist establishment it\'s a flashy restaurant with a big name and mediocre food.\n\nTo enjoy a "lighter" lunch we decided to order the Sushi Tacos Chipotle BBQ Pork Soft Tacos and "Awesome" Pretzel Chicken Tenders.\n\nThe Tacos were made out of the traditional corn shell. My pork though tasted dry but the BBQ sauce helped coat it. The sushi was average at best. The most disappointing however was the chicken tenders with dijon it did not live up to its name and they were not awesome at all. They were lightly battered and overly dried. Zero kick or flavour I could have made better chicken tender in high school during home economics. I\'m sorry. \n\nI would give them props for three things. Our waiter was excellent I wish I had gotten his name but he was young man in his early 20\'s. He was super upbeat efficient and friendly. The decoration was good like Vegas good no expense was spared. We had a flat screens TV in front of our wall and it wasnt even near the bar. And the entrance looked like a Universal theme park. Lastly prices were average they could have charged more for the location. \n\nGeneral thought for someone who has been to some of the best foodie establishment in the business I don\'t think Guy\'s own restaurant would have made the cut. \n\nA nice spacious place to rest while in Time Square but don\'t expect the food to be Food Network worthy.' u"We had heard many different things about this place. It's unclear to me why it's such a controversial place: the food is basically just good diner food; some dishes are a bit more out of the ordinary for a diner (like the sashimi tacos) but still make sense in the context. We had the bourbon wings which were fine the chilly cheese fries with bacon which were pretty good and surprisingly not heavy the sashimi tacos (also pretty nice). Desert was a really good chocolate chip pie with ice cream which was great and much better than most similar pies we had. It also didn't feel like a heavy meal which was nice. My espresso was great margarita was okay and my wife's red wine was pretty good as well. Service was nice as well. All in all a good diner." u"I've been here 4 times. On each visit I tried something different. On my last visit I had Cajun chicken pasta and it had a little too much spice for me. Service was quick. The staff was friendly. I never had to wait to be seated even at 7pm on a Saturday night. There is a lot of seating. The place is set out well and more dedicated to tourists." u'This is just another overpriced tourist trap. I had been to the Mt. Pocono kitchen that had a nice selection of different types of burgers so I was expecting more of the same here. \n\nNot quite. \n\nFirst off halfway into the appetizer and with no place setting I finally had to get up to borrow one from a neighboring table. Not a good start. Ordered the wings appetizer - they were just ok nothing special. A bit fatty on the outside and someone from the kitchen must have accidentally added a honey BBQ wing to our order of buffalo. There was 1 lonely honey bbq wing coated in buffalo sauce. Not a big deal but doesn\'t really spell kitchen professionalism either. \n\nThe real disappointment were the ribs: $27 for 6 ribs and a tiny plastic cup of (what tasted like spoiled) cole slaw. The ribs themselves were tender and flavorful but I had expected a better presentation and a bit more love. Menu said the dish came with "seasoned" fries but they were nothing of the sort. Regular old salty fries and a comically sparse plastic cup of liquidy ketchup. \n\nFunniest moment of the evening was when our waiter had disappeared for a few minutes and I realized I was missing the side of cole slaw. I tried to call a manager over .. made eye contact and raised my hand slightly and as soon as she saw that she turned away pretending not to see me  (this was before I had actually tasted the cole slaw. If I knew what it tasted like I wouldn\'t even bother). But that just underscored for me the level of amateur staffing at this place. \n\nOur waiter Mahmoud was inattentive but super friendly and seemed like he genuinely wanted us to have a nice dining experience .. when he was around. \n\nI will not be coming back.' u"This place is pretty good and I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for burgers and beer. We came here on a weekday night and had a reservation so we were seated right away. \n\nWe ordered sashimi tacos bbq slyders bbq chicken wings and huli huli chicken. The sliders and the ahi tacos were amazing but the huli huli chicken and the bbq chicken weren't stand out. The sliders come with fries with onions. They also have a full bar here. On tap they have a bunch of beers and a cider. I would recommend the cider. It is $8 for 16oz. The food is pretty pricey for what you get though. It is about $13-20 a dish.\n\nAlso great was the service. I wish I remembered my waiters name but he was great! (UPDATE: Looked on my receipt.. waiter's name is Wemaldy). Probably the best waiter I've had because he was nice funny and helped us out good. Idk why but he was a good waiter. This restaurant is pretty big and they have a bunch of different plates with celebrity signatures on them. The decoration has a rock and roll vibe. The location is close to Times Square and in the broadway area. I would recommend this place to other people." u"Went here tonight with a party of 5. We had a reservation and were seated right away despite not all party members being present.  This place is HUGE!\n\nBourbon BBQ Chicken Wings were excellent. I ordered them as my meal as well as mashed potatoes. I enjoyed my food however the rest of my party was not as pleased. \n\nBoth my mom and aunt got the Rotisserie Roasted Garlic-Rosemary Chicken and said it was super dry.  It seems like Guy is a big fan of Rosemary. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and the food came out quick! The ambiance and decor was great. Whatever radio station they were playing was awesome!  Prices are average for NY.  Bathroom was very clean which is important to me. I'd recommend coming here if you can't get into other restaurants in Times Square but this wouldn't be my first choice." u"Horrible service.\nHorrible drinks.\n  Don't know about the food never got to order.\nF.A.I.L.\n\nSat at the bar for drinks and quick snack.\nNo bartender.. no menus no greeting.  NOTHING. 10 minutes not  a living soul.. we were getting ready to leave.\nFinally bartender came over we ordered drinks.. I got a margarita no salt.\n The margarita arrived with a salted rim.. no big deal.  Not what I ordered but not a problem.\n  Problem:  salt got washed off the rim into the bottom of the margarita and each sip was nothing but salt.. it was horrible.\nBartender never came back never asked about food never asked if everything was ok.  It was awful.\n   Finally asked another bartender for the check we paid up and left.\n\nAlso.. upon leaving the right exit door is locked.. you push on a business door and find it locked.. that's just freaking annoying.\n If you are open for business UNLOCK BOTH DOORS !!!!  \n  I HATED this place with a passion..\n Have no idea how the food tasted because we simply NEVER GOT A CHANCE.\n   Guy needs to be embarrassed that his own restaurant is doing such a poor job." u"Pros\n- My service was surprisingly good. My waiter was very attentive and my food was delivered quickly.\n- The pulled pork sliders were delicious.\n- The drinks had a nice taste.\n- Nachos were good but a lot of them were plain - needed more topping!\n\nCons\n- Menu was very small and didn't have a lot of appealing options. If I saw the menu before I entered I would have never came. \n- The burger patty tasted fake... flavorless. How is the only type of burger at an American chain restaurant the mac and cheese burger?? Very limited suggestions.\n- Weird decor. The items scattered around the walls didn't really stick to a common theme. Felt cluttered.\n\nOverall not impressed. Not worth coming back too....." u"Hi! Today I went to guys with a couple of guys and girls. We were in for a good surprise. It was good service and it wasn't particularly slow. The menu was limited. Out of only a few choices I chose a burger with a side of fries. The fries were crunchy and the burger was good. My friend Bella ordered Mac and cheese and for some reason goldfish came on the top. It was good although there are some faults I believe they can fix. I wish u a good time here" u"This is one of those places that u simply want to try because u are familiar with the owner the chef or probably just curious to taste the food. \nWe stopped by during the week & were seated right away towards the upper back area. \nDrinks I tried the Red White & Blonde beer very good nice taste.\nAppetizers we went with the Calamari which normally wouldn't be an issue in most places? Not that it was here but the Calamari is mixed with peppers & onions I feel this kinda yipes u on the amount of calamari they give u calami itself was good did not like the dipping sauce it's a sweet garlic & pepperoncini sauce not great too spicy doesn't go well with the Calamari in my opinion adding just the lemon was better. \nI had the Unyawns Cajun chicken grilled chicken donkey sauce in a garlic butter toasted ciabatta this was delicious great tasting chicken nice combo w the sauce & bread initially I substituted the regular fries with garlic fries ended up getting the regular fries which were very good once I mentioned they didn't substitute they just brought me additional plate of Garlic fries these were ok not a lot of garlic flavor the regular fries were better. \nMy friend had a Caesar salad this was good nice dressing. \nAs for the place pretty big spot seating above & a bar area when u enter fun decor. \nService was good prices l'd say are moderate & typical to the area." u"I've been here for a lunch as well as a private cocktail hour. The cocktail hour was nicer than the lunch.\n\nThe same menu is used all day and features an eclectic selection of hardy bites. Nachos egg rolls salads soups chicken burgers everything. I had the Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger which was massive. I normally don't have any problems finishing a dish but this burger was too much for me. This came with a side of fries. \n\nThe front entrance area includes tall boy tables low tables and a bar area. This upstairs area is pretty casual.\n\nMy second visit was for a professional event. We reserved the downstairs area which probably accommodates upwards of 100 people. We were served drinks in two areas one by the stairs and another in a back room. Servers brought around bite sized appetizers which were great. They served us tacos egg rolls and other items that people kept taking multiple of. They also set up a buffet station with cheeses and meats and a BYO slider section.\n\nGuy's was average for a regular eating out experience and earned some extra credit with its catering/private event services." u"Came here on my birthday. Mistake #1. Sat at the bar. Mistake #2. Stayed to get ignored by bartender. Mistake #3. Anyway don't let the celebrity fool you. The food is forgettable and the service is even worse.\n\nP.S. don't expect to get a table quickly the patrons enjoy sitting in this restaurant reminiscing on their lives for hours on end. The ambiance and aesthetic is nice but the praises stop there." u"Met  a friend for dinner at this place. He was in the bar when I walked in and enjoying his bottle of beer ( I was 15 minutes late)then we moved upstairs.  We were lucky to be able to get dining table for 2 right  on the spot ( I heard you need a reservation or else waiting time is a killer). Oh well it was a good night for us.  A star was added to the review for the accommodation  service and  souvenir photo taken courtesy  by the person in charge of the seating. \n\nOur server was a delight. When I showed him my yelp check-in (free appetizer -yay!) he said that it will be taken care of. Our drinks and meal didn't take long. I assumed because we were early for the peak dinner time. Or because again our server was attentive and efficient. \n\nThe food flavor is alright but honestly  I am expecting for more.  I got their big dipper burger and my friend had their motley que ribs. What made both food special was Guys signature sauce on it Even Guys Italian Nachos was fairly good the toppings on it were enjoyable. It was cool  dining to a celebrity chef restaurant- it added flavor to our dining experience. Our appetite had never been this excited before the experience.\n\nThe serving size is huge. It can be shared.  \n\nThe d\xe9cor is in fashionably celebrity sense - feeling extra special for tonight." u"Awesome food!! Awesome service!! Stopped by after seeing the lion king play with my son. Being that we watch DDD all the time my son begged to go. I was surprised that on a Saturday at 5 pm the restaurant wasn't packed but nevertheless that didn't bother me. I was excited to eat here since I know guy prides himself on his restaurants having stellar service and food. I went to the one in Cancun and was amazed as well. My son ordered off the kids menu and got the spaghetti and meatball. I got the shrimp po boy. All the food was hot not greasy and full of flavor!! Our waiter was super attentive my drink was always replenished before I could blink and he gave great suggestions. I love guy and I love his restaurants." u"They atmosphere was nice and the waitstaff was friendly. Their food was very subpar. Not what you'd think would be at a Guy restaurant. My fianc\xe9 received a wrong order. The waitstaff was nice and offered to correct. Overall disappointing." u"Stopped in for happy hour and an appetizer. They brought my wife the wrong margarita which wasn't on happy hour menu but she liked it anyway. Tried the Italian nachos which were surprisingly good. Decent place."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
194.Up Thai,[u'Went here for lunch. Very nice staff. Food are very good. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian meal. Both were equally delicious.' u"Came here for lunch with a friend from out of town. I had the green curry with tofu and the Thai iced tea. Before I get to the food I have to say that the decor is very nice. It's hip but with a Thai flare. I feel like most Thai restaurants in NYC have a much nicer ambience than their price point would suggest. The service was courteous and everything looked clean. \n\nWe were given the menu for the lunch special which includes a soup or salad an app such as dumplings or spring roll and an entree. I personally chose the green curry which many people had praised on Yelp. It did not disappoint. The vegetables were cooked well with a palatable amount of crunch left in them. The curry itself had a well balanced flavor profile and a decent amount of spice - don't say I didn't warn you. The Thai iced tea was also creamy and fragrant just like it should be. The lunch special for me was $10 but if you got beef or shrimp it would have been a few dollars more.\n\nAll in all this is a great Thai restaurant that I will certainly be coming back to whenever I'm in the area." u"My new go to restaurant. Ratings are based on this being my 1st visit so basically overall serving taste decor & cleanliness. I had the Green Curry which was amazing a little spicy but flavorful. You can choose your own protein- I had chicken. \n\nI surprised myself when I ate my entire serving of salad with ginger dressing- Amazing! Crispy Spring Roll for an appetizer. The restaurant is so cute and inviting. The vibe can either be intimate or casual. I'll definitely be trying out more dishes soon!" u"Pretty disappointed in Up Thai this time around. I came to this restaurants three years ago and loved it so I decided to come back when my boyfriend and I ended up at the MET. We came here on a Friday night around 7:00pm and had to wait 45 minutes to get a seat. \n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nCurry puffs-Way too sweet! These are my go to appetizers and I always get them whenever I go to a thai restaurant for dinner. The puff filling itself was very sweet as was the dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is suppose to be tangy but it wasn't.\n\nClaypot fried rice- Pretty good but also pretty sweet from the Chinese sausage\n\nRed curry with egg noodles (not the real name of this dish I forgot the name)- Do not get this. It was sweet and spicy but didn't sit well. They also had apples and sour fermented veggies in it. We were not a fan.\n\nThai iced tea and lychee thai iced tea- Def suggest the lychee thai iced tea. That was super yummy.\n\nOverall food was literally cooked with a TON of sugar. Everything was just so sweet. By the end of the meal my mouth was so dry from all the sugar intake." u'Surprisingly it has been difficult to find a good Thai place that my husband and I like for curry in NYC. Up Thai has been the best so far. My husband has celiac sprue so the clear designations for gluten-free entrees is very helpful. Since my husband works near by he drops by for their massaman curry and has not had any cross contamination issues. \n\nI have had both the massaman curry and the pad see ew noodles. Both were very good although I typically only order curry. Very nice service and environment as well!' u"This is probably the #1 Thai restaurant in the Upper East Side. In fact it may be better than most Thai restaurants I've ever been to. The atmosphere is sooo cute with decorative lights up in the ceiling and dimly lit. Service is usually attentive and fast. Great for a date night and even casual hang-outs with friends. The place is kinda small so I don't recommend large parties. \n\nI've only been here for their lunch specials so I can only speak for those but they're so worth it. Around $11-12 for a 3 course meal!!! I'm not even kidding comes with a soup or salad appetizer and entree. For the appetizer I usually get the crab net rolls which are delicious. Perfectly fried! I remember once they ran out so I resorted to their steamed dumplings which were actually more of a shumai type thing. These weren't bad either but the crab net rolls are still my go-to. Their salad is also pretty good because of the ginger dressing.\n\nFor the entree I usually get chicken pad see ew or a curry they are all really good! My friend loves the pad thai here as well! Point is I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. Up Thai is the only reason I miss going to Hunter College and I'll always pay a visit if I'm ever in the area. \n\nNote: They do have lunch and dinner hours so they're closed from 4-5PM!" u"Up Thai checked all the boxes for me for a dinner out with friends. \n\nBeautiful dining area (perfect for pictures) delicious but unique dishes and great selection of wine. We had a bottle of Malbec which paired wonderfully with the spicy foods.\n\nWe tried a variety of stir fried curry and classic chicken and rice dishes. My favorites were the Gai Yang and Duck Basil. The tender chicken with sticky slightly sweet coconut rice was a great combination. I loved the sauces that came with. In general it was cool to see duck as a protein option in all the dishes along with the usual chicken pork and beef for an Asian fusion spin. \n\nCan't wait to come back to try more of their dishes." u"Up Thai has it all - and by all I mean wonderful servers super cute decor great food and a good price point. \n\nRight away you'll step into the restaurant and be amazed by how well designed this place is. It's by far one of the more elaborately designed establishments I've eaten at in NYC. The main focal point in the back is their beautiful lanterns which is eye catching. \n\nThe restaurant itself isn't huge and gets quite busy so during peak hours you will very likely have to wait. Regardless the wait is worth it. \n\nI've been to Up Thai multiple times both for lunch and dinner and have never been let down by their service or food. Servers are always attentive and friendly and I haven't had a dish I haven't liked yet. You can't go wrong with any of their curries with chicken in particular I like the red curry. It's spicy but not overly spicy and the dinner portion is quite large! \n\nIf you come during lunch time they offer lunch specials that are cost effective. Recommend checking it out if you're looking to save some money and avoid the dinner rush." u"The decor at this place is wonderful.  Simply walking in one can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design and layout.  The drinks seem very well composed and are a nice assortment of tastes and flavors with attention to nice garnishes.  The seating is a bit close so know that you will be in an intimate setting meaning that you and your company will be within close earshot of your neighbors.  This is NOT the place to take a large group and you should certainly make a reservation for a group larger than 4.\n\nMy main gripes with the place are that our service was rushed during the evening dinner service.  This probably had to do with the line of folks waiting to get in as we were exiting. However if our bill is $100+ for two people I don't think two hours is a lot to ask for full dinner service with multiple appetizers and drinks.  We tried the mussels and crab cakes for appetizers and I would definitely recommend the mussels. Crab cakes were fine with a healthy amount of crab but pack a bit of heat that was not listed on the menu.  On another note it was strange to place an order of the claypot fried rice and have it arrive on the table within 10 minutes of ordering.  Even our drinks took longer to come to the table.\n\nOtherwise it was a nice place to eat dinner and share conversation (and possibly have dessert if you don't otherwise have plans).  It can be a nice place for a date (if your waiter doesn't hover and rush you along like ours) or for meeting friends and family.  Up Thai is still very much worth checking out and I will return with hopes of tasting other dishes and having a less anxious waiter." u"This place has gotten much better! \nI've been here 2 times already within a month.\n\nI love their drunkman noodles the best. They are packed with flavor.\nThe pad thai and spicy basil fried rice are good as well. \n\nUp Thai's food isn't too salty and tastes quite fresh and a bit home-made.\nTheir food isn't drenched in salt and oil.\n\nTheir spring rolls are GREAT!" u"Amazing thai experience in upper east side! All the food is great!  \n\nLocation: You will think that it is small but there is a lot of seating inside also they have outdoor seating which is nice during summer! The interior is nice and very cozy! The lights are amazing! But I think it's nicer if they have like thai decorations like elephants buddha etc. besides this is a thai restaurant. :)\n\nService: OMG just amazing staff! We got seated immediately the front desk is very nice!! Our server is nice as well make sure we have everything and gave us recommendations on what to get!\n\nFood: I tried most of their food. Up spring rolls: it was okay for me resembles of Filipino lumpia but lumpia is better. Thai crepe dumplings: this is one of my fave! The peanut feeling is soo good and crunchy! Thai herbed wings: another okay nothing special. Chicken Satay: okay too but I love the peanut sauce. Pla Muk Tod: this is a crispy calamari good but too small serving. Thai Seafood Cake: my favorite! It is like a crab cake with really good salad with it! Spicy tho! Massaman Curry Gluten: really good and tasty. Tamarind Duck: love the crispiness of the duck but the sauce is too sweet for me. Lastly get the thai iced tea!!! Soo good!\n\nPrice: 7 out of 10\n\nVery nice staff and interior! The food is okay for me but their thai iced tea is a must!" u"Usually I'd be bummed about one of my vacation days in NYC being derailed by nonstop rain but the sudden change in plans just so happened to lead me to a fantastic lunch at Up Thai so for once in my life... I am ECSTATIC that it rained! \n\nDining at Up Thai is a fantastic experience in every regard. I really am not one to care about decor but it's hard not to comment on the beautiful set up that Up Thai has. It's a warm welcoming environment yet simultaneously a spectacle. That's enough about that though...\n\nThe important thing is that the food here is phenomenal. I've had plenty of good and authentic Thai food over the years but no other restaurant has ever hit me with the wow-factor like Up Thai did. I always order curry at Thai restaurants but instead of sticking with one of the curries you can find anywhere else I ordered the similan curry (which is one of the chef's signature dishes). I honestly don't have the words to describe how amazing the flavor was but what I can say with certainty is that it is absolute perfection! In addition to the curry I tried a few bites of the pad thai from my sister and it only took those few bites to convince me that I'd never find a pad thai as good as it.\n\nFolks it's simple. Up Thai is THE best Thai food that I've ever had. Every time I eat Thai food anywhere else I think about my experience at Up Thai and how great it'll be to be reunited with the similan curry on my next visit to the city." u"Ambiance: Stunning \nStaff: Astounding\nFood: Extravagant \n\nFirstly this is a great spot to take your first date.  This is also a great spot to take your 90th date. It's a great vibe for every situation.   Its not too dark it's not too bright it's not too loud it's not too quiet. ISSA VIBE\n\nThe vibe here is really good:\n If you're feeling a lavish you may want to sit in the back of the restaurant. \n If you're in for a quick bite maybe hit the bar. \n If you're here with a friend they've got stools/high chairs for ya(with hooks for your jackets/bags between your legs) \n\nThe staff is attentive and courteous:\n Waiters know their foods and you're greeted correctly and seated quite quickly. (We were seated immediately at 630PM on a weekday. \n\nThe food was delectable delightful distinctive and THEY KNOW THEIR SPICE...thank god I ordered Thai iced tea:\nI ordered crab fried rice(real crab) and told them to make it spicy. Man oh man it was a fair match me vs. the spice.  It may have won but it wasn't T.K.O. but it was good. However the crab was not cooked with the rice.  Instead it was made separately then added on top of the rice once plated.  (I'd prefer if it was cooked with rice)\n\n*to end I left my reusable water bottle and the staff chased me half a block to return it to me* WOW! Amazing.  WHAT A WAY TO END AN ALREADY REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE.\n\nI definitely recommend this spot.  It's not a go-out-your-way restaurant but it's a top choice for Thai food in the UES." u'The food at Up Thai is so delicious. You have to try the calamari the pad Thai woosen crispy spring roll and the pineapple fried rice. \n\nThe drinks are good too. The passion fruit mojitos is my favorite.\n\nThe restaurant is small so make a reservation and try to go during the week. The service is great also. I will be coming back.' u"This used to be my go to Thai place when I lived on the Upper East Side.\nI'm legit sad that I don't live as close anymore because I really miss the food here!!!\n\nI love the vibe of this resto and the food is the BEST.\nI always get their lunch special with Pad Thai dumplings and salad.\n\nEverything about this place is amazing. I miss you Up Thai." u"Ordered from here to a friends house nearby and got them hooked!\n\nThe food is always delicious and it's awesome to know that it's the same quality even when they deliver.\n\nWe got the pad thai pad see ew drunken noodles and massaman curry. My friend who thought she hated curry is now a massaman curry believer--that's how delish this place is.\n\nI also love that they offer mock duck. As a vegetarian I always get excited when I have options and Up Thai never dissapoints. \n\nMy go-to Upper East Side restaurant hands down." u"My friend and I ordered red curry with duck a bowl of jasmine rice and Kua Gai chicken noodles. Plus two crabbie ginger beers. The food was delicious. Service was great! They have a restroom upstairs and two more downstairs. The decor in here is exotic and cozy. I would recommend coming here for Thai food if you're in the neighborhood." u"Pros: Beautiful interior great customer service and the food you can taste it's freshness.\n\nCons: the wait time in busy hours\n\nCost: $112 for 3 entrees wine bottle and dessert\n\nExperience:\nSo we came here for my birthday and I left my name for the waitlist and we waited about 35 min for a table but my party was really late however if they weren't then we would've had a problem lol.\n\nWhen we got seated you were instantly transported into another land and the food was just so good. I had the duck I mean the skin could've been crispier but the noodles and vegetables were so delightfully fresh I didn't even get to share it with my friends.\n\nThey recommended a wine and it hit the spot of what we liked.\n\nOverall:\nIt was an enjoyable experience and a good way to experience elevated Thai cuisine." u"Came here on a Sunday morning at 11:58am and there was already a line waiting at the door for the 12pm opening. As soon as it hit 12pm the restaurant was packed with families and young couples. The ambiance of this restaurant is very cute and I love the lights and green plants around the room.\n\nThere was a lunch special menu so we ordered from there. I got the shrimp + squid pad thai ($12+$3 for extra protein) and it was delicious. Also comes with a selection of appetizers + soup or salad. I opted for the salad and chicken+ shrimp dumplings. They were out of the crab net roll appetizer.\n\nWe also tried the red curry with crispy duck ($16). The curry was delicious but I don't like how the crispy duck was so over-fried to the point where we cannot taste the meat anymore. It was just very dry. I would have given this place a 5 star for the ambiance food and service but the crispy duck was just not very good.\n\nOverall I would recommend checking out this little gem on the upper east side. Close to central park the MET and Guggenheim museums!" u"This place has a great selection of various Thai dishes with authentic sauces.  I have been here a few times as it is conveniently located near my place but also because it is my standard go-to for a meal that is just right.  Nothing is spectacular here but nothing is mediocre either.  \n\nThey don't have same-day reservations and the lines get a bit long so make sure to call a few days ahead.  The upbeat ambiance makes for a great date night."],0.6249,0.369,0.631,0.0
140.Scarlatto,[u'Delicious restaurant that we stumbled upon in Time Square after running the marathon on Sunday. I ordered the Fettuccini ai Funghi. It was the perfect meal to have after running 26.2 miles! The servers were very nice and service was prompt.' u"Stopped in for dinner before a show. Information on google said it was open table but If you know you are going definitely make a reservation. I have mixed reviews about the staff running the place. Upon arrival there were about 4-5 tables open. My friend and I were hoping for one of the tables by the door as the restaurant was very warm inside. The waitress was leading us to the second floor and I asked why can't we sit at one of the empty tables? She said there were reservations. I don't think there were because it took about and hour and a half to have our dinner and cocktails and the entire time we were there nobody occupied 2 of the tables said to be reserved. Lies... That being said at least the food was good. We wound up sitting at the bar and I honestly think it was the best seat in the place. The bartenders took our order and these gentlemen could not have been more pleasant and charming! Very nice guys doing a very good job. Not only were they handing every customer at the bar ordering food they also prepared every single cocktail in the place. They were doing a better job than the waitresses! \nOrdered the Papardelle ala bolognese which was very good. A little salty but overall cooked perfectly. Also had the minestrone soup which was not a traditional style but more like a creamy yellow vegetable soup. Also tasty but not what I expected. Had the profiteroles for dessert nothing fancy about them but I didn't expect them to be crazy in flavor. The food was good. The cocktails were better lol. \nIf I was going to the theater next door again I would return but I would also reserve a table by the door where you aren't stifled by the warmth of the restaurant." u'My husband I went there last Friday. Originally we wanted to go to Carmine\'s but they had two hours waiting at 8pm.\n\nWe decided to order three course thing. They have really good deal for an appetizer a main and a desert for like $29. We both got mussels  for app. My husband got the veal  (+$2) I got sermon (+$3) for our main. Capccino semifreddo and panna cotta for desert. Mussels were okay. Could be fresher. His veal tasted like frozen. My sermon was good. Both deserts were so so. Nothing amazing.\n\nOur waiter was great. He was nice and always around our table to make sure we were good.\n\nOverall this is just the place to go " if you don\'t want to wait in line for better meal."' u"Ate here on October 25th before a show.  It was our first time here and we found it on Opentable.  We had reservations for 6 but when we showed up at 5:30 they were able to seat us.  The restaurant doesn't look very big from the outside but it's quite large.  When we walked in it felt a little warm.  I don't like it too warm because sometimes when I start eating (and have a drink) I start getting a little uncomfortable.  No need to worry because they sat us upstairs where it was very comfortable and also not as noisy as it was downstairs.  Everything I had was very tasty:  a nice berry moscato grilled octopus on top of chickpeas and the Chicken Paillard.  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant.  We will definitely dine  here again!" u"Don't let the outside of this restaurant fool you into thinking it might be petite or crampy inside. It's rather sizable with full seating availability upstairs. Unfortunately I think Scarlatto's location is trumped by its neighboring Trattoria Trecolori which seems to be the fan favorite Italian restaurant on the block. I had actually planned to eat at Trattoria first and upon hearing there was a one hour wait at 6PM on a Wednesday my friend and I wandered over and found Scarlatto's menu not too different from Trattoria's. So wine not give it a try?\n\nThe bread was okay the green sauce which came with the bread made it bearable. The green sauce looked to be made of olive oil and crushed chives and cilantro - maybe. The entrees are certainly something more to look forward to. \n\nThe pasta was pretty tasty. I had the squid ink seafood pasta special. The squid ink pasta had a lean salty finish the brine from the mussels may have added to that nice touch. The dish carries a scent of mixed seafood. I just wish the portion had been more at $28.00. My friend had the braised beef with saffron risotto and the risotto was a bit bland in my opinion. The beef was tender pulled apart easily. I have to add that the entrees came out pretty quickly. I'd say in under 5 minutes so I question how fresh everything was or when the kitchen began preparations. Though I guess when shrimp and mussels are cooked thoroughly fresh is not particularly relevant. But on second thought at $28.00 I can definitely find larger and fresher shrimp. I got tic-tac sized baby shrimp. \n\nOverall not bad but not great value. Certainly a second option if you want to duck waiting on Trattoria.\n\nP.S. No happy hour here." u"Beautiful restaurant and very intimate. Service is good and open late. Unfortunately the food is so so. I ordered pollo ala parmigiana basically it's chicken parm it's doused with so much tomato sauce and the chicken was not freshly made. I was hoping to go to the next Italian restaurant but i stumbled at this restaurant first before I got to the one I wanted since it's so close together. The restaurant is quiet and has a bar by the entrance. If you're looking for so-so Italian food in theatre district with reasonable price this is the place." u'Great food and service!\n\nGot scallops for an appetizer. My husband got the lasagna I got a seafood ravioli. Service was great; we would definitely go again!' u'Do not be fooled by the outside of this restaurant.  I have passed it hundreds of times and never thought to try it.  After a review of Yelp however I decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  I had probably the best meal that I have had in NYC.  We started with the Fried Calamari and Zucchini. The calamari were perfectly cooked and the spicy tomato sauce was fantastic.  For my meal I had the Ravioli alla Vodka with Asparagus and Peas.  It was absolutely incredible!  I already want to go back and get it again!!  Despite being totally stuffed we tried the Panna Cotta for dessert.  It was delicious.' u"I made reservations here when I couldn't get a table at Trecolori which is a better choice for Italian and is one door over. The lower level seating looked nice but we were seated upstairs which is accessed by a set of stairs in the back and is less impressive visually.\nI had the Prix-Fixe and chose the Caesar Salad Gnocchi and Ice Cream. The salad was nothing special; the Gnocchi was pretty good. Unfortunately I believe my cappuccino ice had melted at some point since it had large ice crystals in it. I would have sent it back if I hadn't had theater tickets.\nEven on the second floor service was still responsive so that's one good thing.\nI have a hunch that if I sat downstairs and ordered something else this could have been a 4 star experience but this trip was only a 3 at best." u"We dined here before our Broadway show for my sister's birthday and we didn't have reservations. They were packed but by some luck they had an available table and seated us promptly. \n\nI ordered the Beef Short Ribs with Risotto special which was absolutely delicious! We also ordered the Salmon special and Chicken Parm which we all enjoyed very much.\n\nWe had the friendliest and most accommodating server who even sang happy birthday to my sister when he brought out my sister's dessert! I'm very thankful and would definitely come back next time I have a Broadway show :)" u"Chose Scarlatto because of proximity to our hotel. I have passed it many times. \n\nI was pleased to see a variety of Yelp reviews with a number of positive ones. Add this to that list. \n\nWe had prompt seating with a reservation on a busy evening. Glad we didn't try to walk in. \n\nNice variety is selections on the menu. I went with a simple selection passing on an nice prix fixe offering. Salad with walnuts pear slices and Gorgonzola. Very good. Pleasing size not too small not dinner size. Followed with lasagna. Again very good. The meat was very mild more like ground beef than an Italian sausage. Generous portion. I left some in the bowl since I was headed to the theater. \n\nService was prompt professional attentive but not obtrusive upbeat--happy to be there. \n\nNoise level was high. Low ceiling large pre-theater crowd made for noisy atmosphere though it was not impossible to converse at the table. \n\nI'd return. Bon appetite!" u"I was so unbelievably impressed! The service was absolutely amazing and the food was very authentic. One of the most authentic cheesecakes I've ever had.  It wasn't even our original destination but it turned out to be a very wonderful surprise change. I usually don't frequent the same places when I go to New York just because there are so many options out there. I would come back!" u'This place was almost empty on a Tuesday night and now I know why... bad service and mediocre food. We waited for ten minutes before the waitress even came over to take our order for appetizers much less main course. I had to ask them to bring bread to us WTF - that should be the first thing you bring to the table. We waited over half an hour for our food and at this point they decided to prop open the door so that we were right in the way of a draft that came in from the street. When the food came it was salty as fuck. This place is not worth it and had I known the food and service would be so terrible I would have waited for a table at the Italian restaurant two doors down.' u"In the interest of full disclosure we didn't start off to go here. We screwed up and decided to go to dinner right at the start of the pre-show rush and our first choice was full. The fact that we accidentally stumbled into Scarlatto proves to me that fate knows more about good restaurants than I do.\n\nWe ended up eating at the bar which worked out to be another piece of luck. The bartenders were friendly and attentive despite being slammed. \n\nThe food! We ended up with four dishes. I had the veal and the wife had the pumpkin ravioli (Ravioli di Zucca). The veal was excellent but that pumpkin ravioli was the dish of the evening. \n\nLooking around the now-full bar I didn't see any meal I wouldn't have liked to have tried.\n\nShared the warm apple tart for dessert. \n\nAside from the a**hole couple who were apparently on some kind of date from Hell who took up residence at the end of the bar and proceeded to torment the bartenders by complaining loudly about anything and everything it was a great meal." u'My husband and I went there for dinner last night with another couple before the theater. . Took awhile to get bread on the table so we had to ask for it. Poor service and very disappointed in the meal. However the caesar salad and aruga with gorgonzola and walnuts were very good. 2 ordered the chicken parmegian 1 chicken scarparello and 1 chicken paillard. All were overcooked and the parmegian dishes were by far the worst I have ever had. Was hard to even cut with a knife. Will definitely not return.' u'Located in the theater district. This restaurant is quaint and has a intimidate atmosphere. I got the pumpkin ravioli. It was a bit too buttery for my liking. But the actual ravioli was good. Service was great. I would come back here again.' u'Really really good Italian food right next to the theater. Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. I had the pasta Bolognese and was not disappointed in this dish of comfort.' u"My first time at Scarlatto and it was such a fun experience! My group and I went before a show and the service was excellent. \n\nOur server was extremely attentive (our water glasses were never not full) and the speed of service was fantastic. The bread and sauce they give at the beginning was really good too.\n\nThe pasta is delicious. I ordered the Fettucine and despite the overload of mushrooms it was something new unique and tasty. I also got the apple tart dessert with ice cream and that was good as well. \n\nThe staff obviously love their jobs and enjoy seeing and serving their happy customers. Great wait staff + fast service + 5 star food = Scarlatto. \n\nNext time I'm in the city I'll be coming here!" u"If you're looking for somewhere to eat before a Broadway show or just some darn good Italian this is the place to go. This is the best Italian I've had in NY so far. Of the six of us every single person absolutely loved their meal today. \n\nYou walk in and it's casual but they have white table cloths and music playing. You get to enjoy a casual meal in a beautiful setting. The music plays softly so you can enjoy your company and the atmosphere without having to shout. \n\nThey have very reasonable prices and perfect portions. We'd preciously read that the portions were small; they definitely aren't. You get quite a bit of food for a great price in NY. In our group we had the lasagna chicken pumpkin ravioli pappardelle with bolognese  and pasta carbonara. We all shared and loved every single dish.  They also had a special three course fixed menu (with options) for only $30. Such a great price!  \n\nMy only complaint would be that the drinks were pretty weak." u"It's a fiver. Hands down. Terrific environment great conversations(at the bar!) and a very NYC place to be. Freddie was our bartender\nAnd he was great!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
169.Bubba Gump Shrimp,[u'We have visited this establishment several times and have always had a good experience. But tonight was the best we\'ve had. Amanda was our server and she was fantastic!  She made suggestions but wasn\'t pushy she was very friendly and so fun!  We never had to wait long for her if we needed her. Next time we visit we will DEFINITELY ask for her!  \n\nWe got the watermelon coronita and lava flow split a net catch entree and the dessert sampler. All of it was delicious. The only "negative" was the biscuit on the strawberry shortcake was slightly hard.' u"I didn't eat here but the gift shop was cool to check out for all of your Forrest Gump needs.\n\nThe employees were friendly enough but the selections and prices were ridiculous. Every shirt was almost $30 and every time I did find one that I liked they didn't have it in a size small. \n\nI didn't end up buying anything but it was an interesting stop nonetheless." u"I used to enjoy this place a lot several years ago but it's gone a little downhill and more of a tourist attraction. The wait times are very long 45-60 min the location needs a good deep cleaning staff is friendly and the food varies depending on what you get. \n\nWhen it comes to the fried food everything tastes great.  The steamed/boiled foods are a bit soggy. The bucket of shrimp are baby shrimp so don't be fooled by the picture - we always forget whenever we come and make the mistake of getting it." u"Came here tonight with a party of 5 for dinner. To my surprise there was no wait at all as we all headed upstairs to be seated. Our waiter was courteous and kept checking up on us on a routine basis to see if we needed anything. He even asked us trivia questions related to Forest Gump and that made our dining experience a fun one. \n\nAs for the food I ordered a shrimp mac and cheese for an appetizer and the grilled seafood trio as the entree. The shrimp mac and cheese was mediocre at best. It had sort of a weird aftertaste to it. I wouldn't really recommend it. The grilled seafood trio was slightly better. It came with a grilled shrimp skewer with peppers cucumbers and onions a serving of grilled fish and a handful of more grilled shrimp. The best part about this part was the fish but other than that there's was nothing much really to brag about. \n\nOverall I had a fun experience here but the quality of the food could be improved. Would I come back in the future? Probably not." u'This used to be my favorite place to eat at.  The prices increased but the food has dropped in flavor and portion size.  For a senior citizen found that there was a bit more salt than was needed.   Will try a different dish next time to see if the food is better or if it is just my taste buds.  The dessert was delicious.' u'Loved the food. Staff was nice but one thing I found missing was absence of "Forrest Gump" trivia which I really enjoyed during my last visit to Bubba Gump at Navy Pier in Chicago . \nLocation is spot on - right at time square and you can get a window view on first floor . Overall a nice experience .' u"While walking back to our hotel (through Times Square) we happened upon Bubba Gump's. Mom loves seafood and had never visited a Bubba Gump's Seafood (Why not make her first trip in Times Square right?!) so we stopped in to split a platter and have a drink because why not?! \n\nLuckily there was no wait. The view of Times Square is pretty awesome and the service was prompt and efficient. We also enjoyed our seafood platter and margaritas (Mom had watermelon and I had strawberry). \n\nWithout tying in the hype of simply being located in Times Square the experience overall was simple yet satisfying!" u"Fun touristy stop in the heart of Times Square. There's always a wait but you can browse the cute Forrest Gump-related gift shop next door.\n\nI'm a member of Landry's Select which I paid $25 to join but I was given $25 welcome gift and my birthday was around the same time so I got another $25. So basically I got $50 to spend -- woohoo free money! Every year I get $25 to spend on my birthday so this is definitely a worth while investment.\n\nAlso if you are a member of Landry's Select you get to skip the longgggg lines! Double plus!\n\nThe food here is your typical American chain - oily over the top fried and very unhealthy. It's a novelty eat that is great if you love shrimp! They also have a few other seafood items if you're not a shrimp eater. Think of Applebee's or Chili's but only for seafood. That's what this place is.\n\nFood is average and I would rather not squeeze with the tourists so I'll probably only come once a year when I get that $25 birthday credit." u"It's been a few years since I been here. However Bubba Gump Shrimp has great location great hours and great food. I came here to celebrate a birthday with my dinner guest and had a good time. Service was good. We had a minor mishap with my meal (the mash potatoes was cold) However it was taken cared of swiftly with no opposition. I had the Lt. Dan's Surf & Turf which is baby back ribs grilled shrimp and fries. I substituted the grilled shrimp for fried shrimp and the fries for mashed potatoes. The meal was great. I just wish it had more shrimp for the price. Service was also good. \n\nIf you like shrimp you got to check out Bubba Gump Shrimp this isn't 5 star dinning it's a Forest Gump themed shrimp shack in the middle of Times Square with awesome views of the city. I'm a keep this review succinct because there's hundred of reviews for this restaurant but definitely check out Bubba Gump if you're in the area and have time." u"My 7 year old son is obsessed with shrimp so we took him there the other day. We had such a great time. The staff was very accommodating and really made an effort to make us feel at home. We had a stroller for my youngest and they happily had a staff member escort us to an employee only elevator and seated us comfortably with the stroller right behind us. It was such a nice experience in the city with the kids. I was especially thrilled to be seated right away with a party of six!\nThe food was good and there was plenty of space so you're not sitting on top of each other. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. As soon as we flipped the sign to STOP any waiter passing by would stop to see how they can help. The portions were good and the food came quickly. Definitely going to take the kids back next time we're in the city!" u"Nothing southern anymore about Bubba Gump. They used to have a legit menu about 5-6 years ago. Now their menu sucks. Every thing they have is fried with a crust. Overpriced and tastes like crap. The new staff has no clue as to what their menu was like before. Food used to be affordable and tasted great. It's the complete opposite now." u"Come here every time we are in Times Square. Sure it's a chain in a city with tens of thousands of restaurants but it's always good and the atmosphere... well it's all about Forest Gump! With our Landry's Select Club we skipped the 30 min wait and were seated in about 5 min of hitting the door with a window seat overlooking Times Square. Our server was amazing kept our glasses full and the pace of our meals perfect for enjoying the atmosphere. As always the food was hot and delicious. We will be back as it has become a tradition for our family. I definitely recommend becoming a Landry Select Club member even if you don't have any Landry restaurants near you. The priority seating is well worth it." u"I so love this place. I go like 2-3 months  cause their food and customer service is so great. I remember when my mom brought me here for the first time in 2015 . Now I can't stop going here.Every time I go I get the same thing the shrimp scampi which comes with garlic bread and  the lava flow drink  which u can get as a virgin drink or you can the regular which comes with alcohol. I highly recommend it" u'Great food and excellent service! I was very happy with my tasty meal and portion size! \n\nI had the best Clam Chowder ever.  \n\nI really recommend the place!' u"First time I tried to come here a few months ago on the weekend it was so packed I couldn't get in which isn't a surprise being that it's Times Square. Second time I came on a weekday afternoon and there was no wait I was seated right away! If you love shrimp and you loved the movie Forrest Gump then this place is for you! I loved the theme of this place and how they had the restaurant set up with pictures from the movie and everything Forrest Gump themed! You also get a good view of Times Square from the restaurant since you're seated upstairs. Service here was great! Our waiter was bubbly and kind and full of energy and very helpful and of course the shrimp was delicious!! At the end we got a free margarita mixer which we picked up from the gift shop downstairs on our way out can't wait to come back!" u'Bubba Gumps is one of my favorite places to go in time square! The staff is friendly and the food is delish!' u"I had the shrimp po' boy sandwich (good) shrimp mac and cheese (very good) onion rings (good) garlic bread (okay) spinach dip (good).  For dessert I had the sampler.  I'm not a fan of their bread pudding.  The strawberry shortcake was good.  The chocolate chip cookie was very good despite not wanting it initially because of the nuts.  My server Alfred was a sweetheart.  I would definitely go back." u'If you are a fan of Forrest Gump you have to go to this place!! All the walls and tables are full of things related to the movie and they even have tvs where they play the movie all the time. The menu is mainly of dishes with shrimps as Bubba and Forrest dreamed!' u'Visiting New York for the second time I had to try this restaurant so see what the buzz was about.  I had the Accidental Fish and Shrimp and it was excellent!  Love the lemon and butter sauce with jasmine rice!' u'ahh bubba gump - fond memories of stopping in here during family vacations near the cancun mexico and orlando florida locations. \n\nvibe/space : corny (but isnt that what youre kinda looking for in a place like this?) yet fun ambience. decorations are similar to a rustic boathouse/cabin all of course forrest gump themed. you have to walk upstairs but they have a gift shop on the ground floor. i know this is times square\nso your first thought is - im never going to get a seat here. well we were seated IMMEDIATELY and although we stopped in at 8:00pm on a wednesday night (which im sure contributed to seat availability)  i can say that this place is objectively cavernous in size - so even on the busiest nights the wait may not be as long as you would think.\n\nservice : A+. our server Ty was knowledgable pleasant and present when he needed to be (but not overbearing). the hosts and the rest of the staff put up with my dads silly jokes. thanks guys.\n\nfood: lots and lots of fried shrimp options (golden fried coconut tempura) - you really cant go wrong with fried shrimp. they also have a lot of not fried styles - broiled grilled spicy Louisiana style etc. other fish are also available - mahi mahi cod (in the fish and chips dish) among others. some non-seafood items here and there as well.  i ordered the shrimp po boy : baguette was warm crispy on the outside doughy on the inside - contents = just the right amount of condiments  and perhaps more importantly fried shrimp.  i also picked at my sisters coconut shrimp as thats an old favorite of mine - love the sauce that comes with it.\n\nprices : apps between $10 and $18 sandwiches between $14 and $20 entrees/shrimp and fish meals youre lookin at around $19 up to about $26ish. not cheap but youre not going here for a quick cheap bite- youre going here for the novelty cuz youre fortunate (or unfortunate depending on how you look at it) enough to be in times square and because you want fish (which is on the expensive side just about anywhere you go save long john silvers).\n\nbottom line : contrary to mrs. gumps favorite saying you know what youre gonna get here : gimmicky ambience well-trained staff and decent seafood. if it doesnt mean running across the country like her son did (in other words if youre in the area) id say give it a shot.'],0.3612,0.094,0.906,0.0
38.Sushi by Bou,[u"I am so in love with this place. I was in NY only two nights for work and both nights I had to snag a reservation here. Everything was perfect - from the sweet hostess to the knowledgeable bartender and quick chefs providing delicious nigiri. The Omakase was very fresh great cuts of fish and I am still drooling over the sweet Santa Barbara Uni. The space is really cozy and the service incredibly attentive and not in an annoying way (I think a lot of restaurants don't know where to draw the line). \n\nCan't wait for this place to pop up in the Bay Area!" u"I'm a fan of the affordable 30-min omakase! Sushi by Bou at the Sanctuary Hotel was a great experience and deal - $50 for 12 pieces of fresh fish. And even though we only had 30 mins I didn't feel rushed at all!\n\nThe staff and the eponymous sushi chef were very friendly and entertaining. Also loved the hidden entryway with the fun and colorful graffiti. \n\nMaking the reservation took a few days as my initial texts were missed but I was able to make one within the week. Highly recommend for a fun and yummy sushi experience!" u"Great sushi--loved every piece especially the toro handroll (which I ordered as an extra after the omakase was over). Great value also (I left still a bit hungry even with ordering hand rolls after but $50 for a 12-pc omakase is still a great deal). Only 2 reasons this isn't 5 stars:\n\n1) Although Chef Bouhadana is AWESOME (super funny friendly welcoming interactive and just a fun guy who knows how to entertain) my guest and I were assigned to another chef who stayed silent through almost the entire meal. Meanwhile the guys next to us seemed to be having quite the party with Chef Bouhadana and given how small of a place this is it's hard not to take notice. I wish it were just Chef Bouhadana for everyone or someone else who is at least half as friendly/entertaining.\n\n2) I felt very rushed with my meal. Less because of the 30 minute time-frame they give you but because people starting showing up for the next reservation while you're still enjoying your meal and since it's such a small cramped space you feel pressured to hurry up and not order too much extra so all of the people behind you can get seated for their reservation on time.\n\nOtherwise loved the fish quality and Chef Bouhadana!" u'Made reservations the day of for a group of 4 and was given multiple available seating times to choose from. Just text the number and you\'ll get a reply pretty quickly however make sure to show up on time because you only get a 2 minute grace period. This restaurant is located next to the hotel in the basement. The door man walked us there but it could be easily missed. Look for the flickering "eat me" sign and lots of graffiti and you\'ll be buzzed in. \n\nIt\'s a pretty small space with a bar on the left some stools for waiting along the wall and 8 seats. Granted it\'s indoors so thats better than Sushi on Jones in that sense that it won\'t be cold during the winter months. Once we were seating on the stools the hostess gave us waters and the bartender came over a quite a few times to ask us if we wanted anything on the menu. The service was good but $16 for a mixed drink is pretty high. They don\'t have the unlimited sake option like the other location offers. \n\nWe had a reservation for 2pm but we were not seated until 2:15pm. There were people in our seats and I guess it took the hostess some time to realize that we had been waiting for a while and didn\'t want to rush the other guests. In the sense you don\'t feel as rushed while you\'re eating there but if you expect us to be there with a 2 minute grace period then I\'d like to be seated at my reservation time. \n\nThe sushi was great and each piece was very fresh. There weren\'t any repeats except for the tuna. I opted for the uni wagyu hand roll at the end and it was delish. The 12 piece omakase was $50 plus tax. I didn\'t chat much with the chef but I did recognize him from Sushi on Jones. Chef Bou was there but he seemed to be performing managerial duties instead of chef duties.' u"The food: 5/5. Wow!! I'm in love with this $50 omakase thing New York is doing. I was told by a fellow yelper Chef Bouhadana left Sushi on Jones to open this spot which is even better and it is so much better indeed. Every single piece I tried was superb as well as the toro handroll I ordered a la carte. I would go back every day if I could. \n\nThe service: 5/5. The typical fast paced experience the sushi chef was friendly and gave good explanations of each piece. Also they get an honorable mention for having a Japanese tentacle erotica print by Hokusai in the bathroom. Classic. \n\nOverall: 5/5. The best lunch you can find in Midtown." u'Ummm. Yes?? I was expecting a decent sushi omakase but I was really impressed with ALL of the pieces.\n\nOnce you walk into the spot (which is to the right down the stairs not the "not restaurant" door- no it\'s not a trick) you smell the sushi rice and seaweed and fresh fish immediately. You\'re greeted by a friendly hosted and invited to enjoy a cocktail. Yes expensive cocktails but I can tell the bartender really put his love and passion into the creation of them. It\'s a very personal experience with both the bartender and chef David.\n\nReady to make my next reservation!' u"$50 omakase for 12 pieces? SIGN ME UP!!\n\nSimilar concept as Sushi on Jones but BETTER! Higher quality of fish more interaction with sushi chef and intimate environment. A lot of cocktail sake options. \n\nFavorite pieces were torched toro botan shrimp wagyuni (of course) and the handroll add-ons. Overall fish was very very fresh and texture was amazing. No soy sauce needed as the pieces come with appropriate sauces. Our sushi chef was cordial and careful in explaining all the pieces we tried. Dinosaur and I were contemplating whether we should spoil ourselves extra by ordering handrolls and we are SOOO glad we did! We tried the toro and hamachi and both were very good. \n\nDefinitely would visit again. For the price and quality you cannot get a better deal especially in the city! Located in the basement of Sanctuary Hotel on 47th street. Accepts reservation by text only 2 min grace period so don't be late! This location is right in the heart of Times Square which means lots of traffic and tourists." u"One of the best values for quality sushi in the city 12 pieces omakase for $50. \n\nLocated in the basement the entrance is to the left of the hotel doors behind a wooden fence and down a flight of stairs. It's a very intimate space. The sushi bar seats about 7-8 people and there's a small bar against the wall as you enter we're you can wait and/or enjoy a drink. Reservations are done over text and highly recommend if you don't want to wait.\n\nThis is not the best sushi I've had but it's probably the best given the price. They use quality ingredients and the chefs are skilled at their craft. They operate a very fast casual experience where they don't rush you but meals tend to be around 30 mins. It's very similar to models found in Japan. We came on on a busy night were there were 2 chefs behind the counter. The flow was great good spacing between pieces and nice progression. We opted to also add the waygu uni handroll for an extra $14 because we were feeling guiltiness but in hindsight it would have been better without it. It was saucy and little too salty for my likes and not the best way to end a masterful experience.\n\nOverall I highly recommend trying Sushi by Bou. Always a great meal and interesting conversations with the chef." u"Occasion: dinner - Omakase\n\nAmbience: \nVery small basement-turned sushi restaurant. The front entrance was covered with hipster graffiti - indicating this may not be your usual sushi place. The dining space is pretty compact but by limiting traffic (30mins for omakase) they make it work! The sushi bar seats around 8 people at a time carefully curated by chef Bo\u016b. He tells jokes and makes it fun and comfy to dine with him. The waitress would also attend to people who are by themselves and make sure they are not bored - a subtle practice I see in very good Japanese restaurants. \n\nSushi:\nOmakase contains 10-11 pieces of sushi - ingredients are top-notch quality and the chef puts his own creative twists to them and made them magically delicious! Yes it's only 10/11 pieces so if you come famished you may still feel kinda hungry (as my friend did). But at the price of $50 for Omakase you get almost the same sushi quality as the like of Sushi Nakazawa. It's definitely worth a visit! Plus you can add more sushi at extra cost.\n\nDrinks:\nTheir drink menu is equally excellent! Highly recommend - Yuzu Honey Bee" u"Ok let's get this out of the way YES Sushi by Bou is better than Sushi on Jones.  I loved Sushi on Jones but after trying Sushi by Bou I have to give the winner to the latter due to the quality of the fish and how each piece was perfectly seasoned as is there was no need for soy sauce. \n\nSushi by Bou has a nondescript entrance that leads down a set of stairs. The space is small but efficiently set up and minimally decorated. There is a small bar at the opposite corner as well a small ledge opposite of the sushi bar for early comers to hang out and grab a drink. I loved the giant fish mural behind the sushi bar where two chefs were busy at work. The sushi bar itself can seat three on one side and 5 on the other. We were running 10 minutes late they were extremely accommodating and did not threaten to give away our reservation as some places would have. The small restaurant itself was warm and welcoming. \n\nNow let's get to the main attraction the sushi!  We did the standard omakase the progression is similar to Sushi on Jones with the same amount of pieces (i.e. 12). I think the main difference in terms of the pieces being offered is that Sushi by Bou had one less wagyu salmon and did not offer Crab; instead it had ikura albacore and toro. In terms of the preparation I felt that Sushi by Bou had a better rice to fish ratio as well as better seasoning as each piece can be eaten on its own without soy sauce. Moreover I preferred the pieces being offered by Sushi by Bou. Unfortunately we were running late as well as being super full so we didn't get a chance to try the hand rolls. We did get to indulge in a few of the cocktails I tried the blueberry sake margarita which was absolutely delicious. \n\nAnother major difference is that Sushi by Bou accepts tips whereas Sushi by Jones does not however the former has a few more staff members including server/bartender. Lastly having a restroom is definitely a major plus in my book. The two Sushi chefs one of whom was the restaurant's namesake Bou (ie David Bouhadana). They were both friendly and unobtrusive I loved watching them work especially how fast they roll the rice.  Bottom line I highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back soon!" u'Enjoyed this so much better than Sushi on Jones and I think the main reason is it wasn\'t as rushed--I assume that\'s because (1) I went at an off-peak time (late lunch) and (2) Chef Bou has opened multiple locations where people can now get their budget omakase fix.  Instead of a rushed 30 minutes we ate everything in about 45-50 minutes.  Still fast!  But slow enough to feel like it was an experience and not just a meal.  \n\nAlso I may be wrong but I thought each piece we got here was different in some way whereas when I went to Sushi on Jones at least 2 pieces were repeats.  Everything was exceptionally high quality and the rice was delicious too.  I enjoyed every piece and was happy to have some extra time to savor each bite.  You don\'t get unusual fish but for a solid run-through of "the basics" it\'s a great place for omakase.  I subbed out wagyu in my meal because I\'m trying to decrease my intake of red meat and I highly recommend the substitute which is scallop & uni (instead of wagyu & uni).  Uni is so creamy and rich and paired well with the meaty but clean scallop.\n\nI also enjoyed chatting with our omakase chef--I don\'t remember his name but he was the Chinese chef who I assume is posted up at this location at least during weekday lunches.  Chef Bou was there but has taken on a more managerial front-of-the-house type of role.  You can tell he is very excited about what he\'s doing.\n\nStill slightly higher-priced than some comparable spots like Yasuda which does $48.50 for 10 pieces and a roll with gratuity included but Yasuda won\'t be giving you toro uni sweet shrimp or scallop.' u"Came here a couple of weekends ago with some friends and loved it! This is the new location that just opened up; I've personally only been to this one so I can't compare. However friends have told me that they prefer this location because it's nicely decorated and more intimate. \n\nIt's a little hard to find the door because the restaurant is actually in a basement next to the sanctuary hotel. There's a little stall outside with steps that lead you to the door. \n\nOmakase is 12 pieces for half an hour. After trying Sushi on Jones and Sushi by Bou I can confidently say that Sushi by Bou is much better. The quality of each piece of fish better here and Bou does a great job of pairing toppings/sauces with the fish. I think my favorites were the wagyu/uni scallops sweet shrimp and salmon. Once omakase is done you have the option of ordering more. We chose the uni wagyu handroll and noticed that the chef took extra care to cut up the wagyu before toasting it and wrapping it in the handroll. I applaud his attention to detail as it really speaks volumes about how thoughtful he is about crafting the menu. Bou is also very friendly and welcoming! His charisma definitely added to the already great experience. \n \nLoved the experience! I can't give this place enough stars. Make sure to contact them in advance for reservations." u"I was pretty skeptical and came with low expectations but ended up really enjoying the sushi. The quality of the fish was very high and having gone to another omakase last week where the fish was pretty tasteless and undersalted I really appreciated Chef Bouhadana's attention to flavor. This may not be for everyone as some people might prefer sushi that is pure and un-enhanced by salt/yuzu/searing but I happen to really like it. \n\nThe rice was also flavorful and warm and Chef Bouhadana himself is very friendly and charming. He is a very good businessman. Our dinner didn't feel rushed by the 30 minute cutoff maybe because it was a weekday night and things were a little slower than usual. \n\nMy favorite pieces were the toro the tuna and the eel. Very good value for $50 and I appreciated that the menu was written on the board. There is also a selection of handrolls that you may order after the omakase is finished ranging from $8-$14. All in all I thought the omakase here was better than Sushi on Jones (also $50) Yasaka's counter omakase ($45) and Sushi Kaito's ($75 including service) so I will definitely be back." u'Must eat NYC - definitely last meal material.\n\nPrice and quality of the sushi is imbalanced (in a good way). I wish there were more stars I could give. \n\nFirst of all reservation was very easy and response was quick. I texted the number directed on the website and got a response within 15 mins. I texted on a Sunday for a Monday night reservation. \n\nSecond of all service was great and accommodating. I had a 7:40pm reservation and I texted them that I\'d be getting out of work late and they accommodated my last minute request and changed my reservation to 9pm. Then the dumb me took the wrong train after getting off of work (literally took the opposite direction and didn\'t notice until 15 mins in) so I texted them to let them know if it would be ok for me to come at 9:15. The host told me it\'s ok but the clock still starts at my reservation time not when I arrive. I was a little put off at first thinking that I may only have 15 mins to eat 12 piece of sushi. But the foodie me overpowered the logical me so I went anyway (and I\'m freaking glad that I did!!). \n\nIt took me going in a couple doors to find the actual location; I went into sanctuary hotel then the sushi/ steakhouse place next door then finally I found the little secret doorway to Sushi by Bou. \n\nI sat down and I didn\'t feel rushed at all even though I was their last customer. I felt like I was more rushed than they were (I really didn\'t want to hold them up for closing). \n\nI was greeted by the host and he brought me to drink menu. I normally don\'t drink so I asked if him could recommend a non-alcoholic beverage so he asked the bartender to give me suggestions. I ended up opting for omakase with my drink too. He brought me a virgin mojito which was pretty amazing. \n\nI was served by Chef Tashi today and he\'s amazing. He let me take my pictures slowly and waited until I was done taking a picture and finished eating each piece to make me another piece. The omakase experience is a little fast-paced as one would expect (given the mandatory 30 mins limit) and I ended up spending about 35 mins there despite being 15 mins late (so yes they didn\'t limit me to only eating for 15 mins). \n\nI was served piece by piece by Chef Tashi. The fish was very fresh and the rice was made right. Yes the rice is very important in sushi and it can ruin really fresh seafood if it wasn\'t made right. Execution of each piece of sushi was done right - from molding the rice to pairing the each fish with its corresponding enhancement. \n\nI was served the 12 piece course and I also ordered an extra Uni hand roll. Towards the end of my 12-piece course chef tashi asked me how hungry I was and I told him "pretty hungry". So Chef Tashi "blessed" me with 2 extra pieces of special sushi (one of them is called the "Big Mac") and an extra toro hand roll!!! \n\nSpecial sushi 1: wagyu beef + Uni + toro\nSpecial sushi 2 (the "Big Mac"): wagyu beef + sea scallop + toro + Uni \n\nI don\'t know how they make money out of this but as a customer - my belly and my wallet were both very happy tonight! I will definitely be coming back every time I\'m in town and will bring my friends and family here. I cannot introduce all my friends that will be visiting NYC this awesome place.' u"I went for lunch since I work across the street. It is a tiny tiny space in a basement. There is a wooden gate and a sign that marked its location. Come through and you will find a small sushi bar and a tiny bar at the corner. Although small space they had everything. Drinks seem to be extensive and the fish was fresh. They don't rush you to finish in 30 minutes. Our whole meal was about 60 minutes. 1 chef served everyone and he was very nice and was pretty chatty at the end. Don't expect the exact menu on the website but comparable. We ended our meal with a scallop + uni piece plus a tuna scallion handroll. We had uni 3 times :) MY FAV!\nThere were 7 of us at the bar and seats were definitely tight. When the other group the sound is trapped and it drowns our voices. \nThey don't do take-out so make your reservation via text and enjoy!" u'This place is awesome. Very friendly very fresh. Jay is very good . Great value. A little tricky getting in. But so good went 2 nights in a row' u"I had an absolutely amazing experience here last night. It was easy to make reservations and I was surprised that I managed to get a spot for two people when they only have 8 seats. Everyone working there is attentive and polite. \n\nThe sushi. You get 12 pieces and it's all so fresh . I enjoyed watching them prepare each piece and interacting with everyone. It was an intimate experience and so much fun. I didn't want the experience to end so I got myself an extra hand roll. Definitely worth it. \n\nCocktails are really good. If you're not sure which to get they can help make suggestions or do some modifications based on the spirit you prefer . I got the Yuzu honey bee with Hendricks . \n\nFor the price point and the quality you get I think it's definitely worth it. I can't wait to come back." u"Honestly this review should be 3.5 maybe even 4 stars but going to have to robinhood this review a bit and give Sushi by Bou a solid 3. \n\nGuys. I think we all have a little bit of Stockholm's Syndrome especially when we're showering this small basement pop-up with a mountain heap of praise for serving $50 omakase one where you're shuffled out the door at the 30-minute mark. Boy does this dude know how to make money. At a clip as quick as that he's easily making the same amount as other omakase places with 1/20 of the rent and the fish isn't near the quality as these other places. Is it still delicious sushi/nigiri? Absolutely. But you can tell piece by piece that it's certainly not up to par with other places. I'd only go here if you have two constraints:\n\n1. You have a hankering for omakase\n2. You only have 30 minutes to enjoy it\n\nOther than that I'd look elsewhere." u"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. This place is right by his work place. We liked the idea of having an omakase in a limited amount of time since he was on his lunch break. It was weird at first getting used to how quick our chef was in serving us our sushi we're used to omakase being served at a slower pace. Our chef (Kin) was great and very talented his arms were flying everywhere. The sushi pieces were flavorful and I wanted to keep eating. I was worried it might not be enough food before we went in the restaurant but we were full from the meal.\n\nWe texted for our 12pm reservations\n\nThere's a bar in the corner (I got the Yuzu Honey-yum!)\n\nDavid great! He's super friendly and comfortable to talk to. We wanted to try the wagyu but he said his supplier was out of it he went the other day. As we were leaving someone walks in with a shipment of wagyu beef and he gave it to us on the house.\n\nTips: don't walk into the hotel it's to the side. It's a basement restaurant that looks graffitied on the outside but very nicely furnished inside. When you walk down the steps open the RIGHT door don't open the one straight ahead." u"Been to this location and the Chelsea market one several times. I would have to say this is one of the best bang for your buck Omakase in the city. I love their text to reserve service. Whether its for lunch or dinner I've always gotten a prompt response. The location is convenient but could be hard to find if you're not looking. Its down the stairs and to the right on an unlabeled door (slight speakeasy feel to it). The space is small but serves its purpose. The drinks are great here and the bartender is passionate about creating anything you like off the menu. We were seated on time and you're off to the best 30 minutes you can have with your pants on. My favorite is always the handrolls. Handrolls are best handed straight to you from the chef. Crisp seaweed warm rice and slight cooled fish the temperature and textural differences is what makes them so great. And they do it right here!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
203.Miraj Healthy Grill,[u"One of their Long Island locations is my family's favorite place for special dinners so I was pretty excited to try this new location. I went on a Saturday night with a group of fellow Iranian friends and they sat us in the back at a long table. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with the complimentary hummus babaganoush potato sambouseh and salad brought out for everyone. I was stuffed already after all of that! But after stuffing my face on those bites I got grilled white fish which I enjoyed. It was light and seasoned well and they gladly subbed in veggies for the rice it comes with. \n\nMost friends got koobideh or barg and liked their food. We all split two pitchers of doogh and I thought theirs was top-notch. Not too salty or minty. Finally we got a round of chais and one glass of faloodeh. If you want a light dessert and enjoy the taste of rose order this! \n\nOverall Miraj is an awesome addition to the options of Iranian food in the city. Hope it gains more popularity!" u"Excellent!! I work nearby so we walked over for lunch and had their lunch special. I believe they just opened recently because this used to be an Asian restaurant. \n\nI ordered the: \n\n#4 char grilled chicken breast kabob which came with rice grilled vegetables a side salad with dressing pita bread and my app was the eggplant.\n\nThe chicken was tender and juicy. Rice was perfect. Eggplant was AMAZING. Service was great and it's a nice sit down restaurant. You can also order take out or just sit at the bar. Great food for really a great price. \n\nWill definitely be back! :)" u"I Really don't write many reviews... but this place was awesome!  Ordered the lunch barg (strip beef) super tender very generous portions with an appetizer salad olives pickles delivered promptly. The gentleman in the phone who took my order was super courteous too! Definitely will be reordering from them soon. So excited to have them in the neighborhood." u"My favorite restaurant!!! Persian food that's full of flavor and the owner Muhammad is so nice. Lunch special is ridiculously cheap at 12 dollars and various stews and kabobs to choose from. You really got your money's worth. I ordered the lentil stew which came with free app of salad and hummus. My new go to spot." u'A new must try place in Murray Hill! One of my favorite Persian restaurants in the city. Meat is prepared very well. Gotta try the lamb chops!' u'Miraj is amazing. I ordered the lamb shank and it was the highest quality lamb meat I ate in the city. Customer service was good and the waiter Ahmed was cool and kept it real. Family owned business' u"By far the best Persian spot in the city. Superior quality to Ravagh at far more competitive prices. The lamb and beef are cooked to perfection  with a lot of flavor. Most places lack flavor or are too dried out. Customer service is also amazing given that it's a family run restaurant with various locations." u"Ambiance was very nice.  Service was excellent.  It's BYOB so that is wonderful.  That's a great start.  Unfortunately the food didn't live up to our high expectations..  First of all there was no fresh persian bread baked here.  It was pita that tasted the same as from the supermarket plus it was not warmed.  They start you will a lettuce salad and some yogurt dressing on the side which is nice.  We ordered the avocado salad which had 4 thin slices of avocado with a few cherry tomatoes on lettuce with a dressing that tasted only of lemon juice. The lamb kabobs were tasty but not charred and the pieces were unevenly cooked.  Some were rare and some were well done.  The rice was good and fluffy.  The chicken kabobs were the biggest problem in that they had a strange herbal flavor that neither of us could recognize and neither of us liked.  It came with grilled veggies which was mostly onions some peppers and some zucchini.  We were disappointed but will give it another try if they begin to serve the fresh persian bread we like and address the other issues we had." u"This is my favorite place to go to for Persian food. I usually go to the one in Mineola because it's close to my house but I really like this new location because it's close to my school and the Empire State. I went there last night with a group of friends and it was freaking amazing. I got the lamb shank and it was tender and juicy. My friends had the kabab sultani and lamb chops. They all loved it. This place is QUALITY and better priced. CHECK OUT THE LUNCH SPECIAL!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
30.The Halal Guys,[u"Sometimes you forget how good the OG street meat guys are... then you're a bit tipsy in the area and rediscover the best darn street food in NYC The Halal Guys. Armed with multiple carts on both sides of the street the infamous line down the block has shortened and they're all too quick to sling you some eats. It's a sharable plate if you must and super filling for one. Great deal for under $10. Do yourself a favor and eat it asap! Taking it home really kills the experience (and flavor).  \n\nProtip: be easy on that red sauce playa. It's hot. Also you can' go wrong with some extra white sauce." u'Nice guys good food. Easily the best quick food option in this area.\n\nThe white sauce is great...bbq is awesome.' u"Solid. \n\nNice guys good food. Easily the best quick food option in this area.\n\nThe white sauce is great. The red is too but is made from atomic fire. If you're in the neighborhood go." u"I grew up in Asia and am wired to love street food. So with all the buzz that I've heard about Halal Guys over the years I was due for a visit with this concrete jungle staple! Between me and my sister we got the combo platter and the falafel platter for $16-- cash only. There is no seating so we just sat on a ledge and people-watched as we wolfed down our gigantic plates of food. I was quickly won over by the warm fluffy naans but not by how lukewarm and dry everything else was. The white sauce packets helped a bit so make sure you have plenty of these with your order. We finished our meal with plenty leftover and not entirely blown away. I may come back again if I'm ever wandering the streets of NY for some inebriated late night grubbin." u"With all the high prices in New York thank gawd there's The Halal Guys.  Ya know I never even understood what the hype was about and then when we got one in Seattle everyone was determined to try it out.  Although I haven't been to the Seattle location yet I was glad to have tried Halal Guys in the city where it started. \n\nNo matter what time of the day it is people seem to get their Halal Guys fix any time of the day and actually in any part of New York!  I was amazed by how many Halal Guys locations there were when I was in NYC.  It seemed as though every street corner had a HG food stand including this one where right across the street - there was another Halal Guys! \n\nI had the Chicken and Rice combination and added white sauce with it.  The food is constantly being made so it's always ready as soon as you order.  The portion is huge so you're guaranteed to have leftovers.  And most importantly the chicken was tender and yummy with the famous white sauce.  There really isn't much to the bowl as it's just chicken over orange rice with some lettuce and pita bread on the side but it is good and reminiscent of comfort food.  I have to say this is one of the best deals in the city for a hefty meal that's fast and affordable." u"OMG this place is a gem! Walking around Manhattan after a long day of traveling and going around NYC it was late night we were super hungry and things around here are pricey just because is Manhattan we found this spot and ordered a platter (chicken and lamb/gyro) and decided to order only one and check the size before ordering a second one. They order came put extremely fast and the size was more than enough for 2 people!\n\nThis is a stand in the middle of the street so there's not seats but we got the change to seat around and it was delicious! Very tasty good portion of meat the proportion of the rice compared to the meat was good. Both of us were full and still having some left overs and that doesn't happen often when sharing our meal. \n\nThey have chicken gyro sandwiches and falafel in the menu for $5. \n\nThe mix platter was our option and they also have falafel over rice platters are $7. \n\nThey have different kinds of salsas that you can put in your meal we didn't but that's an option. \n\nDrinks are available too and I was surprised they didn't over charge those (food trucks sometimes over charge drinks to compensate the cheapness of their meals). But this wasn't the case we got a Coke and water and paid $3... I thought that was fare.\n\nWhile eating we saw a lot of people buying to go cars stopping people on foot... I can tell this is a famous spot. \n\nI recommend you to pass by and try this place! Food trucks and street food is always the best and I'm happy I got the change to enjoy this!" u"I was super hyped to try Halal guys due to their reputation. Unfortunately I was not warned that their hot sauce is INSANELY SPICY and after adding a modest amount over my chicken platter my taste buds were destroyed. Sadly I could only eat half due to the pain and had to through away the rest which sucks because the chicken was cooked well. It was really bland without sauce so add that white sauce and go easy on the hot sauce. I also didn't like how they give shredded carrot instead of rice. \n\nService is not great but prices and portions are good. \nToo bad I would have given 4.25 stars but instead had the worst experience. \n\nFood: 3.5/5\nValue: 3/5\nService: 2.5/5\nOverall: 2/5" u'This is the most popular food cart in NYC. Well if you live in NYC and you did not try it then you are missing out. This is an inexpensive meal so it does not hurt your budget by trying it even if you do not like it. At this location which is the original location there is always a line from lunch time until very late at night. There are couple of food cart there and many people get confused which cart is the real halal guy cart. I always recommend people to find the cart with the longest line and order it from there. The line always move fast so do not worry about waiting in long line. \n\nGetting there before 12pm then you will find yourself in no line or short line. After that time you expect your to wait roughly 10~15 minutes and still it is not that bad. First timers I always recommend getting half chicken and half lamb on a platter unless you do not eat chicken lamb or both. Each platter cost $8 in change including tax. Chicken is a bit plain but the lamb is very flavorful. I usually put good portion of sauces on the chicken platter and put less on the lamb. There are three major sauces at Halal Guys white BBQ and hot. Both the white and the BBQ sauce are great for the chicken but watch out for the hot sauce. The hot sauce is extremely hot so do not try to put the whole package in. (Clearly that was a WARNING!) everything else was good.' u"To my surprise on a Sunday around 12:30 PM there was no line!  For the money you can't beat the value of the combo (chicken and gyro platter).  It is packed with rice chicken and gyro meat with some lettuce and slices of warm pita bread.  They don't put the sauces on the platter anymore instead they give you packets of their famous white sauce (each pack has a whopping 32 grams of fat) and their extremely spicy sauce.  The combo is now $8 but still a bargain for NYC.\n\nI really liked my combo platter.  Once you start mixing everything in it tasted great.  Be careful with the spicy sauce if you can't handle the heat.  I only put a few drops in and I was sweating after a couple of bites.  My girls shared the chicken platter and they devoured it pretty fast.  \n\nThey are opening a location just five minutes from my house in Rockville MD next month.  I am so excited for this.  I hope it is just as good as their food stand." u'Halal Carts probably are the majority of carts that line the streets of NYC but no one beats the Halal Guys!!!!  I already had these guys bookmarked due to so many great reviews from Yelp friends. So I excited to see there was literally one cart or more on each corner by the hotel we were staying at.  With so many bookmarked places I was worried I was not going to be able to hit them up. . . .LOL not the case!  I think we went 3 nights in a row after late night drinks!\n\nHere are the reasons to go:\n*Cheap and dabomb.com Food! $7 meal in NYC?!!\n*Gyro was great! Chicken plate was great! Gyro plate was great!\n*That dam white sauce was a hit!\n*That dam red sauce (now be careful) was spicy as heck!\n*These guys are QUICK! Lines would be down the street and they handled them swiftly!\n*Open very late perfect late night eats!\n\nHere is the reason not to go:\n*If you do not live in NYC you will go home missing this cart and wanting more. . . .' u'My favorite go-to NYC street food!\nAlways come here with my best friend! We just love halal guys. You get a great platter with any meat rice and salad. Super duper filling. That amazing white sauce that comes with the meal makes you want to keep eating! That lovey soft pieces of bread tops the dish off.\nBeware of that spicy hot sauce... will surprise you on how spicy it is.' u"Love love love halal food here! It's been 3-4 years since I last had it so needless to say it tasted amazing. Though the experience was quicker and not like waiting back then in anticipation...\n\nWe walked up to it by seeing 3-4 people man the original one. $8 for a combo of chicken and beef? Well worth it. \n\nWe told them what we wanted food was already cooking and kept warm in the grill after paying you step to the side and WHOOSH. A brightening yellow bag with The Halal Guys logo is handed towards you with your request. If you are eating with someone else make sure to ask for a extra fork. They now also have prepackaged white sauce (2 of them) and a packet of hot sauce.\n\nPresentation may seem plain at first but combining the sauces in? It was an explosion of flavor. Meat is tender but a bit dry which adds to the crispness - quite well flavored. Meat may be a bit salty for some which is why we had the rice. Rice goes well with the white sauce and the spicy sauce. Wouldn't eat the rice on its own of course.\n\nIf you are looking for seating there is a public space area that's hidden nearby. Just have to walk down to the middle of the street.\n\nAlways a must have when visiting NY. You can't get this in California." u"Still delicious as I remembered it. Although this time my chicken over rice didn't have any lettuce or tomatoes on it. Came here on a Friday night and there was line which didn't take that long. I'm not sure if they ran out of the tomatoes and lettuce but I didn't see any. Also they initially didn't give me any bell peppers or onions on mine so I had to go back and ask for it. The guy didn't seem too happy but it's your fault giving it to us or for not asking us if we wanted it or not... also we said we were gonna take it togo and they didn't close it or give us any togo white sauce... and he told us to get the sauce ourselves which was on the side of the cart. \n\nThey also have a BBQ sauce that I haven't seen before when I was here 3 years ago. They opened a Halal Guys in San Francisco but it is not the same. Also in SF it is more expensive. Chicken over rice...I'll love you forever. Must have in NYC!\n\n**do not put too much red sauce if you can't handle spice. It is actually quite spicy!**" u"Too good and too cheap to be true. When I had Halal Guys for the first time I just hoped that it was worth the hype -- and it sure was. I'm not in Midtown too often so I resort to the many halal food trucks scattered throughout the city but nothing beats the quality that The Halal Guys brings.\n\nAlways ask for extra white sauce because it's sooo good and the hot sauce can get quite spicy!!!" u"As their success has grown their quality has gone way downhill. I used to come to this flagship location frequently in my 20s usually after a long night of drinking. And I don't know if it was my drunken tastebuds at the time or the fact that I used to drown my food in sauce but my more recent visits were extremely disappointing. The orange rice is another let down: you'd think by it's color that you'd be in for some remarkable flavor and yet it's shocking bland. They switched the meat as well: what was once lamb has now been replaced with beef. Long gone are The Halal Guys glory days; they are now being upstaged by lots of carts throughout the city who may not be as famous as of yet but are churning out a far superior product for those who care to venture past this big name." u"Haven't had this here in a long time. The price definitely shows that. It's now $8 for the platter but it's still very affordable.\n\nWe got here around 2am and there were no lines at all which was great. Got my combo platter faster than I could take my wallet out. After paying I went to the side to add my white sauce. The food is always great. The rice and meat are served hot. The meat were a bit on the dry side this time. I didn't realize it at first but then I found out they didn't give me any lettuce. Oh well too late at this point.\n\nOverall it was as good as I remembered it minus the lines." u'So the infamous Halal guys... the original which "original" is actually written on the side of the truck so that you knew which of the many many halal food trucks was actually the one that made history. My goal: should it be as hyped up as it is? My answer: YES. Our vacation to NYC consisted of one aim - eat well. And we did. And to break my long existing rule that while on vacation never try a restaurant twice we did it anyways. That\'s how good Halal guys was. We went twice on our 5 day vacation. To summarize it\'s a food truck with a very limited menu. But why do you need a vast menu when what you have was amazing? Maybe that was their idea behind that. Rice is the base and you can choose between chicken beef or combination comes with pita bread and a little bit of sauce... never stop at that little bit of sauce... always may I repeat always.... add more.\n\nThe white sauce is from another planet. I\'ve never tasted anything similar to this sauce so I\'m not quite sure how to explain it. And I\'ll repeat what some of the previous reviews commented "when you think you\'ve had enough add more."\n\nThe red sauce is incredibly spicy. I added a few drizzles but mixed in with the white sauce - astronomical power. \n\nWaiting time: I read there is a ton of people always trying to go eat here and the lines can go really long. However we had no wait both times we came because we went after our long days of adventure (Broadway\'s and such) and arrived around 10:30. Perfect right? No wait the food was amazing and our hike back to our airbnb made us feel like we somewhat burned off our heavy meal. \n\nIndeed it is very heavy. So on my normal non vacation self I would not go that often. But keep in mind these portions are huge! For $8 my husband and I split a bowl and we were both incredibly full afterwards. \n\nThe chicken was the best to us. Try the chicken plate add tons of sauce and take a walk after to make you feel less sore after eating such a heavy meal. Highly recommend. It hit every high point for me. You come expecting an amazing food truck well I definitely got to eat from an amazing food truck.' u"Going back to 10 years ago since I first had Halal Guys on a rainy day. Halal Guys has been one of my favorite place to eat. The line can get long but they move pretty quickly.\nI went here during my recent visit brought my husband mom and sister they all loved it! They're not stingy with the portion and the sauce- unlike the one in SoCal.\nBut the next time I come I probably will get all beef rather than combo." u"So after 2 tries of trying to get original Halal guys in NYC and always failing both times. The third time comes around and third times a charm! My boyfriend and I had gotten here around 2am and the line wasn't long at all. There was a bit of a line but it did go by pretty quick. So have your money out and ready to give to the guy taking orders! \n\nWe got the lamb and chicken combo plate. There was a lot of food! Unlike the locations we have here in SoCal where they only give you like half of the amount they do here. They have bottles of the white and red cause on the side of the cart. However be careful with the red sauce. IT IS HOT AF! I messed up our food because I put too much red sauce on. Even though I had already known that it was super hot. SMH. \n\nAnyways 3 stars because I thought the original Halal guys would be better but it was just meh." u"There is a lot of hype about The Halal Guys food trucks and this is basically their headquarters.  For street food in the US it is great (and preferable to a hot dog or whatever) but I was hoping for something more like a European or Turkish kebab shop.  The chicken was good but the beef tasted like any generic ground beef (not bad but a lot like taco filling).  However it was near instant service a great price and friendly staff so I'd definitely be back for a quick meal just not a culinary destination."],0.8828,0.339,0.661,0.0
205.Kashkaval Garden,[u"Amazing flatbread and spreads. Highly recommend. Tables are very very close together though so maybe not the best for a first date (sat next to one of these).\n\nCan't wait to return and try more dishes!" u"Came to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a great time and the food was very good  especially the cheese fondue. We only ordered multiple plates but I'd like to come back for an entree one of these days. The beer list was good as well. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that the seating is pretty cramped." u'The lunch specials here are incredible. I popped in here on a whim because I read "fondue for one." That\'s what sold me and I will definitely be returning. \n\nThe fondue was absolutely delicious and I really appreciated the portion of cheese and bread. It hit the spot.\n\nI enjoyed the restaurant interior as well. I was dining alone at around 2pm which was the provided the perfect setting. The space is intimate perfect for date night but also enchanting with the bottles of wine hanging on the walls.\n\nThe server could have been a bit more attentive given the fact I was almost the only person dining in the restaurant but I wasn\'t unhappy with the service I was provided. \n\nI look forward to returning to this restaurant to try all of their delicious looking dips!' u"Meh so I wanted to give this place four stars because the food is so damn good and the decor is just downright cool. The service is what broke it. Our waitress barely spoke at a mumble I literally had to ask her to speak up because I could not hear. My girlfriend and I were chatting for some time waiting for our appetizer when BANG the waitress came out of nowhere (watchoutwatchoutwatchout) and slammed our appetizer plates down on the table. Holy tzatziki I spazzed so hard; it was jarring after she was so quiet to begin with.\n\nOur appetizer was barely on the table for 2 minutes when our main course arrived. This made us feel rushed to make room on the table. This is crucial: adequate time between courses is what makes a tapas place a tapas place. This detail was completely glazed over and makes me wince in retrospect. There was not enough room on the plate for all three skewers so they were uncomfortably packed on top of each other. The mixed veggies were awkwardly nestled under the skewers almost like an afterthought so plating wasn't the hottest either. The experience was in many ways cramped.\n\nIt's weird because the food was so delicious! If the service was up to par this meal would have been so much better. I would totally come back with the hope that my server doesn't try to clear my sinuses nor make me speed eat." u"Great place to get a variety of foods from kebabs/skewers fondue and a great spread of well spreads!\n\nCame with a group of 5 and got 3 orders of skewers ($25?) 5 orders of tapas ($19) and 2 orders of the truffle fondue ($30).\n\nFor the skewers we got the turkey meatballs octopus and chicken. All were really good and had a spicy kick to it! They season all the meats really well. The octopus was surprisingly really good and a favorite!\n\nFor the tapas we got the hummus babaghanoush walnut pepper spread the one with beets and something with artichokes I think. Loved the hummus and babaghanoush!\n\nTruffle fondue was exactly what you'd expect from it and delicious! Pretty fair pricing of food when you're splitting it between people. Also a decent amount of seating at this place so would definitely come back!" u"No complaints on this favorite spot of mine in hell's kitchen. Atmosphere is perfect like a cozy rustic farmhouse cabin and the yummy small plates and fondues are simply perfect in every way. The kale salad is exceptional. I feel happy when I'm there." u"We haven't been to Kashkaval since they moved. We like the new space. Food is still delicious. We started with an assortment of dips. Hummus beet one with nuts and brussel sprouts. All were great. I had the poutine for dinner. Good but not incredible hot. The cheese curds we're still pretty cold in places. My wife had the fondue and it was delicious. Drinks were great. I had an old fashioned made with apricot instead of orange. Great twist and delicious. Staff is fabulous." u"Came here the other night with my boyfriend and was really pleased with our experience. My roommate had recommended we check it out and I'm glad we did. \n\nWe ordered the pita and choice of four spreads (the babaganoush and hummus was delicious wasn't a huge fan of the olive one). We also got the peppadew peppers filled with cheese which were SO delicious (my personal favorite) and the halloumi cheese sticks which my boyfriend really enjoyed but I found underwhelming. We also got one order of fondue - we got the classic but it was a little to sharp for my liking I think we would've liked the lighter kashkaval fondue more. \n\nOverall the food was great and the ambiance in the restaurant was beautiful. If you get the chance ask to be seated in the garden in the back!" u'Updating my review after a great brunch experience here.\n\nWe came in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place was fairly empty and we got a seat in the beautiful skylit back room. We had the two skewers combo and the Turkish omlette. Both were excellent and the side of seasoned potatoes they came with were delicious. Slightly on the oily side but tasty nonetheless. The brunch special drinks were tasty and strong too. \n\nGreat value for a delicious satisfying brunch. Will be back here.' u"Food here was great! A bit pricey but definitely worth it! I got a grilled cheese sandwich which came with caramelized onions. A friend and I shared this appetizer that you get bread and dip it into different dips...forgot what it's called. Anyway the one that really got me what dessert: pistachio cake. It was delicious! Next time I'm gonna try the fondue though cause I heard that's what they're known for." u"Skewers and dips galore. Intimate setting and affordable pricing. Proteins simply prepared and flavorful as were the dips. Unless you've any dietary restrictions you can't go wrong with any of the items. Made an exception to skip greens because I didn't want to miss out stuffing my face with the skewers and dips. Did try the chorizo as well and that's probably the weakest item of the meal. Service was very nice as well." u'This place was definitely worth visiting after all these reviews!! The red beet that everyone was raving about though.. That was not the same one we got :( however the other vegan and vegetarian spreads we got were DELICIOUS and the both of us were too full to finish them! We were at happy hour so the wines were only $5 I believe!! \nI want to come back for brunch :)' u'I have been here a few times and I have never been disappointed. Service at the bar is wonderful and service in the garden room is also top notch. As a vegan I always order the vegetable kabob and it is fresh and delicious. I am looking forward to the next time I come here!' u"Solid skewers (we got shrimp this time with our kale salad and it was probably my favorite of the things we ordered). Kale salad was ok (kale was good but a little too sweet for my taste with the figs). We also got the 4 order tapas (listed from least favorite to most): (1) Artichokes felt like they came out of a can (wasn't a fan too salty) (2) Tzatziki (had better in terms of flavor at other places in midtown like Nerai) (3) hummus (so good!) and (4) baba ghanoush (really good- I liked the texture but others may not - it was a tad lumpy as if there were chunks of eggplant in there)." u"Came here on a friend date and it was the perfect spot. It's small but has charm. The food was amazing and reasonable especially during happy hour. They had a happy hour special for a bottle of cider which was maybe the best cider I've ever had. Great place to catch up with friends or a romantic date" u"Came here for the first time this weekend and enjoyed the traditional fondue with vegetables fruit and bread - delicious .  Also tried the turkey meatball and lamb skewers - didn't love them but loved the potato and rice sides they came with!  For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding which had dried cherries mixed in....not a fan.  I loved our server and the host was fabulous...he never forgot that we were waiting for a table and kept us posted about the wait time with charm and humor." u"We ordered the four skewer platter. The lamb chicken and spicy chicken were amazing. They were well seasoned and cooked very well. I would pass on the filet next time because it wasn't a great cut and a bit overlooked. We enjoyed the cocktails!\n\nThe atmosphere was modern and fun. Our waiter Jeremy was extremely upbeat and accommodating. He is sure to put a smile on anyone's face!\n\nI will certainly be back!" u"This is one of the best cheese places i have been to. The ambience is amazing. I liked the seating in the back ratjer than in the front.  We ordered peppadews and a 4 tapas plate. Peppadews were the best i have had. The walnut spread and the asparagus hummus were hevenly in thr tapas plate. Roasted artichokes and the spinach feta did not hit the mark. \n\nWe also ordered the cheese plate. We wanted to try the couplou goat cheese  but on the waiter's recomendation we went for pierre robert plate which was extremely salty. Not the best.\n\nWe chose truffle cheese fondue in the end. The fondue was ok but i would recommend sticking with tapas appetizers and the cheese  plates. We were extremely fullso we did not have place to try out the dessert.  For next time! Overall i loved the foos and tje experience." u'A friend and I came here for brunch and we were very pleased! I got the Chicken & Octopus Skewers and she got the Turkish Scramble. We also got their Tabbouleh to share (tapas). \n\nMy skewers were absolutely delicious. The octopus was cooked and seasoned perfectly - not chewy at all! The chicken was beautifully charred. My friend said her Turkish Scramble was full of flavor and she cleaned her plate. The tabbouleh was also perfectly done. We had zero complaints! I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place.' u"Met a friend here while in Midtown and wasn't quite sure what to expect. Ended up getting a quaint little mediterranean place with amazing food! The restaurant is very unassuming and doesn't stick out on the road between 55th and 56th on 9th ave but the inside is quite nice and cozy. The front is a little more cramped but the back is where you want to be. It feels like a backyard/garage area with lights strewn across the ceiling in a very ornate manner and there's a small outside section that is neatly decorated as well. Very nice touch with romantic vibes great for a date night I would say.\n\nThe menu is simple but has a lot to offer. We started off with the spinach flatbread and hummus both of which were fantastic. I especailly loved the flatbread the spinach was well roasted had a good amount of cheese and the toppings themselves were generously added on. My friend and I also split the fondue and a shrimp skewer (came with 4 pieces so perfect for sharing). The fondue was great a single serving being more than enough for two people. It came out in a creative manner and they light the bowl for you right there! The skewers are a nice touch as well and add to the fun/social aspcet of the meal (hence perfect date night place). The shrimp was well seasoned in a pesto sauce and were certainly not shrimp in size (bad joke haha). Oh and the happy hour was great too I had a margarita on the rocks and it was a great compliment to the meal.\n\nAll in all give this place a go. It's definitely hidden amongst the other places on the block but stands out for the food and experience!"],-0.1007,0.092,0.796,0.112
198.Joe’s Shanghai,[u"I love me some XLBs! I knew I had to try Joe's Shanghai during my first time in New York. I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and crab steamed dumplings as well as the green onion pancakes (yes all for myself!).\n\nThe green onion pancakes came first and they were perfectly cooked not too oily which I loved! Paired so well with the sweet soy sauce. The dumplings were HUGE! The soup was super juicy inside. The only gripe I had was the dough of the dumpling was too thick. \n\nGreat experience!" u"Good soup dumplings and regular dumplings but the other dishes are a bit too oily for my personal taste. \n\nJoe's Shanghai is known for their soup dumplings and the pork ones are a classic. What surprised me though is how good their non-soup dumplings are. We got the pan fried vegetable dumplings and they were delicious - the filling tasted really fresh and it was a nice amount of fried but not too oily. And the dumplings were massive. \n\nThe other dishes we had were decent in flavor but way too oily. We got the home style bean curd and lo mein. You definitely get a big portion for the money (why I love Chinese restaurants) but the oiliness was overpowering. \n\nit's actually a pretty small restaurant (surprising for a Chinese restaurant and surprising for midtown) so there can be a wait.The seating is pretty cramped as well - I was definitely too close for comfort to my fellow diners. Not a bad option if you're in midtown but there are definitely better Chinese restaurants downtown or in Flushing." u"The service is slow and the food is bland.\n\nThe menu has peppers to indicate spice level but no matter what we ordered we received food less spicy than the taco bell mild sauce.\n\nThey don't know how to make fried rice - it was an oily mess.\n\nWanted to try out Joe's Shanghai because everyone loves to talk about it but turns out it's another tourist trap in midtown." u"We had \nStirred fry string beans. Very oily. \nSweet and sour fish. The deep fried fish was crispy but had weird smell. The sauce was too sweet. \nWe came here because of yelp's review and very disappointed. \nStirred fried broccoli was super sweet. We couldn't finish it.  \nFried rice was good not oily and had nice aroma. \nPepper crispy duck was ok but not crispy   \nThe best dish was xiao long Pao. The soup was very tasty. The skin wasn't as thin as dim tai fung's." u"I have been recommended to Joe's quite a few times since coming to New York. Part of me knew this restaurant was catered to foreigners but I decided to try it out anyway and now I can say there's way better Shanghai food at other places in the city.\n\nI came here with two friends on a week day night and were seated right away. The restaurant is big with two floors of seating ranging from two-person tables to 10-person tables. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable here.\n\nWe ordered some XLB to start. The pork ones were pretty good and the best thing we ordered all night but definitely not the best I've had. We also got the jumbo shrimp which was pretty big and fresh. I liked that it wasn't overcooked either but I was pretty put off by the broccoli florets around the plate. It seemed like they were just for decoration but we ate them anyway and they were so bland. We also got the sesame chicken which also had the same dry cold and bland broccoli. The chicken itself was chunky tender and flavorful though. We decided to share the shanghai noodles too but it wasn't impressive at all to me. \n\nOverall I wish they put more effort into the execution of their items especially the vegetables complimenting the dishes. Otherwise Joe's is definitely overrated and I would suggest going to Shanghai Asian Manor for their XLB's instead." u"I came on a Thursday around 9 PM and we got seated right away. I was surprised at how much seating this restaurant had. \n\nMy favorite item was the pork soup dumplings followed by the crab and pork soup dumplings then the Shanghai noodles. I think I prefer the pork soup dumplings without the crab because it's the more traditional taste I'm used to. The crab and pork ones were still good and you can tell they use a decent amount of crab from the texture of the meat. Both of them were extremely juicy which I was happy about. There was nothing special about the Shanghai noodles and I would prefer more of that wok taste. \n\nSo far I have tried two different soup dumplings in the city and I prefer these ones." u'I came for the dumplings right before my flight back to Detroit. I let the servers know I was on a time crunch and they accommodated greatly. \n\nWe ordered about 6 different dishes...all were okay nothing I would recommend to anyone visiting the city. Pork dumplings were pretty good!' u"Overall I prefer Din Tai Fung but had to try Joe's since I was in NY.\n\nWe went to the W 56th location right after the lunch rush so we were seated right away. We ended up ordering:\n\nCrab xiao long bao: it had good crab flavor though the skins were a little thick for me\n\nPork xiao long bao: lots of soup inside\n\nSeafood fried rice: I would pass on this next time (not much seafood)\n\nClams with black bean sauce: good flavor but a lot of sand in the clams\n\nHot and sour soup: not my favorite\n\nI am glad that I got a chance to Joe's but I am not sure that I would try this again." u"I like how they have a location in Times Square so you don't have to make your way to Chinatown just to get some delicious xiao long bao (XLB).\n\nIf you're a visitor to NYC and looking to just try a bunch of different good restaurants I recommend this:\nGet 1 order of the pork/crab XLB pork XLB and chicken XLB and nothing else. This is perfect for 2-3 people. Other menu items will be good but I'd save your stomach space for other good NYC food. Momofuku Milk Bar is right across the street!\n\nIn Chinese culture burping is a sign that you enjoyed the food!" u'This place is just "okay" and nothing extraordinary. The service is attentive and sometimes there\'s a wait but the nice thing is that it\'s too floors so there\'s plenty of space and turnover. \n\nI usually get the pork soup dumplings the saut\xe9ed string beans with shredded pork and scallion pancake. The food fulfills my craving of soup dumplings without having me to trek all the way to Chinatown and have to deal with the overcrowding and tight spaces. So the biggest plus is its convenient location!' u"Came in to see what the fuss was all about. I was actually super excited being someone that is very familiar with Din Tai Fung food I mostly ordered dishes that both restaurants had to compare it better. I was expecting it to be better but it wasnt. :-( Overall I did not enjoy or I should say we did not enjoy the food here. \n\nI do recommend coming when they first open everyone needs to be present to be seated. Within 30 minutes the restaurant is filled and there are a lot of people waiting to be sat. Mainly people on their lunch break that work nearby. So definitely come first thing when they open. Hostesses are friendly and serious about their job so they will be busy. The restaurant itself is run down and dirty looking because of how everything is so old looking but the tables were clean. They have 2 levels second level we got to was by the stairs. Idk if they have an elevator or not though. But we are seated right away we came when they opened. They actually opened the doors 15 minutes before their scheduled opening time and got a list going with the people that were already waiting. Server is pretty much everyone. All the servers were professional and really fast too. \n\nUpon being seated they gave the 4 of us waters and 2 little bowls of premade soy sauce/vinegar mixture with sliced ginger inside. You're not too close to other tables so that's a plus. It gets rather loud once they fill up though. \n\nThe bathrooms are really small and tight to get in. Bathroom sign itself was hard to see because it was worn Down. \n\nAnyways here's our experience with the food. \n\nWe ordered: \nJellyfish Cold Appetizer - super delicious and clean tasting had a tad too much oil but this was probably our only favorite dish that we ordered. It was yummy though.\n\nPork Soup Dumpling/bun - this was probably the worse Xiaolongbao I've ever had. The skin of the dumpling was thick and the soup inside had the consistency of pasta water. It was like drinking dumpling water that was thick and oily. The pork meat was not as tender as it should have been. Did not have a quality feel to it.\n\nPork and Crab Soup Dumpling/Bun - this one was slightly better than the pork one because it had that nice crab guts flavor but again the soup inside was really gross. It was that thick pasta water consistency and super oily as well. Again did not have a good quality to it. Dumpling skin was the same too thick and not much care was put into these. \n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup - the broth tasted clean and was clear but not as much spices/herbs in it it tasted almost like a basic beef broth. I was hoping to taste more flavor of star anise or something along the lines of that in there that would make it distinct.  But I didn't. The noodles were good in it. I felt like they put too much noodles though so I couldn't balance how much noodles was in there with the little broth. The actual beef meat tasted dry like they presliced and left them out in the air and it got dry. \n\nGreen Beans with Beef - this dish was quite salty the majority of the sauce was definitely soy sauce. The green beans itself was okay it was a little overcooked though but not too bad the beef was really good and tender. Went well with rice. But this dish definitely needs rice to balance out the saltiness. I think this dish needed more garlic or something. I wasn't awed by it sadly. \n\nShanghai Fried Noodles with Pork - this was probably the only entree that I enjoyed better than the others. The noodles and seasoning was good. It was flavorful and super filling. It went really well with their chili oil. \n\nNotes: you'll have to ask the server for chili oil they bring it out right away. We didn't have to wait for the food that long everything came out quick. Servers are excellent they offered to change out our sauced up plates and refilled our waters promptly. Anything we asked for was brought out right away\n \nEven though I didn't enjoy the food too much I enjoyed the experience and the service. I am willing to come try some other items again though. Prices are higher we paid $85+tip it was like $100.xx. wasn't worth it in my opinion. But you live and you learn" u"Went here for a pretty early weekday lunch (around 11:30) and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  We were seated upstairs and It seems to be a little quieter up there.  I was happy that the tables aren't right next to each other like in some other restaurants.  \nWe tried the crab xiao long bao and the orange chicken lunch special (we asked for it to be made not spicy).  The soup dumplings came out really fast and were very delicious.. there is a good amount of soup in these dumplings and I loved the crab flavor.\nI didn't love the orange chicken but that's because I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces.  My son on the other hand devoured the entire platter of chicken and rice.  The only disappointing item was the chicken soup that came with the lunch special.  Neither of us could enjoy it.\nI would definitely return here in the future if I'm in the area." u'Went there for a pre-theater dinner.  Friendly attentive service with quick delivery of the food.  \n\nThe scallion pancakes were edible. I have had them before elsewhere and these were oilier than I expected.  Not as good as hyped.  The soup dumplings were interesting and we ordered the crab and pork. Both were OK with the concept better than the taste itself. The pork main dish was very oily and the pork very tough.\n\nWill be looking for alternative spots.' u"The go-to spot in the east coast for soup dumplings? \n\nI'm a fan of Din Tai Fung (west coast) so I had to try it out since I was in New York. Took 15 minutes to get seats and everyone that works here is very young. \n\nEnded up ordering the pork soup dumplings crab/pork soup dumplings and green beans with beef. \n\nThe soup to the dumplings were pretty good but just didn't really like the skin. It was a bit thick in my opinion. The green beans w/beef was pretty good though (just expensive). \n\nThe waiters I guess were bored and were chit chatting on the side in Chinese (yes I understood everything- and they were talking crap about some of the customers). \n\nOverall okay but I still prefer Din Tai Fung- sorry!" u"Came here with my cousin for a late lunch at 3pm and skipped the line! We ordered the following:\n\nCrab meat & pork XLB - 4/5\nPork XLB - 3/5\nString beans w/ minced pork - 4/5\nShanghai noodles w/ pork - 2.5/5\n\nThe highlight of the meal was easily the crab & pork XLB -- there was a generous amount of crab roe in each dumpling. Although this was good it definitely isn't near the best I've had. The string beans were flavorful and crunchy! The Shanghai noodles were underwhelming wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe amount we ordered was probably enough to feed 3-4 people. The staff were polite and attentive. Not a bad place to try if you're in the area and in the mood to get your XLB fix." u"The Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown is better than this midtown location.  We ordered the Pork Shanghai Dumplings and the Mapo Tofu with rice.  Better than other Chinese restaurants for the soup dumplings but for some reason still ehhh..." u'Had lunch with my son here and we loved it! I wish we had such good Chinese food here in Texas!!  We had the beef with black mushrooms and bamboo and spicy chicken with peanuts. So delicious!!  Loved the chicken and corn soup too.' u"Overall 3.5/5! \n\nService (3.5/5) here is just okay - the wait can be up to 45 minutes even on a weeknight for two (you grab a number and are given an estimate - the server told us 20 minutes but it took double the time). Food comes out quickly but it does feel like they want you to finish the food sometimes to clear the table. \n\nFood (4/5): everything I've had here is enjoyable from the classic veggie with garlic dishes to the lo mein and chow fun. Soup dumplings are also delicious though I did find the Chinatown location to be slightly better. \n\nAmbiance (3/5): nothing fancy about this place two floors with simple tables feels like a typical Chinese American restaurant\n\nFor Midtown when I'm craving soup dumplings it's a good go to but definitely would rather eat at a smaller place in Chinatown with less of a wait." u"It's good. I am not sure it's worth the trip across town but it is worth the experience once. If I was local I suspect I'd be here a good bit. It seemed like the bulk of the guests were there on lunch break and worked in offices nearby.\n\nWe did get dumplings and they were tasty but I couldnt say that much better than other soup dumplings at other spots. \n\nThe whole fish was good a lot of food of course and very well prepared. It takes a while so be prepared to wait if ordered. \n\nNo complaints and surprisingly good service!" u"The soup dumplings here are what this place is known for.  They came out steaming hot and they come 6 per serving.  And these dumplings were plump and big let me tell you.  Steaming hot very flavorful and bursting with soup.  We got the pork dumplings and the crab/pork mix.  My girlfriend loved the salty briney flavor of the crab mixture while I loved the oily juicyness of the pork.  \n\nWe also ordered fried rice (yong chow which means house special fried rice).  I'm a big stickler for wok hay which means breath or energy in Cantonese.  Basically it's that smokey almost seared taste you only get from cooking in a very hot wok.  This fried rice did not have that quality which I die for in a good fried rice.  \n\ntldr; come here for the dumplings not the rice."],-0.0772,0.0,0.86,0.14
125.Treehaus Mima,[u"Wow what a great place to eat for lunch!\n\nThis is especially true for the lunch bar as I can't comment on what they serve at other times of the day as well as the other food stations.\n\nFor the food bar the price is a flat fee of $9 for a small box or $12 for a large box or giant plate for an in-dining experience. You can not beat this value. The food is not weighted but rather it is for whatever you can fit onto the plate. Great selection if you want to go healthy or bad as there's something for everyone. The only gripe I have is possibly the fact that when they serve salmon it manages to be not pink inside (medium rare-like) but that's the preparation type I like. I almost feel bad for myself for placing so much food onto my plate but I somehow manage to almost always finish whatever I grab.\n\nThe grocery section of the place is really pricey and is probably meant for the locals who live around there. Speaking of which it's near 10th avenue and you may have to walk a long time from Broadway to get here. You'll be pleasantly surprised if you do!" u"Above and beyond service!!!! Omg!!! Christopher and souf were just THE ABSOLUTE BEST!! Friendly welcoming helpful generous energetic thank you for hosting us!!!!\n\nOur wine glasses were never half empty. $1 happy hour oysters SO delicious. $5 Rose. And complimentary bread and fresh olive oil dip. Can't beat this place. Highly recommend!! We are flight attendants from Hawaiian airlines and trVel around the globe. This service and food is TOP NOTCH!! \n\n8/5/17 UPDATE: JAVIER THE CHEESE MONGER IS AMAZING! expected verbal/visual only schpeel on cheese but not the case.   Extremely knowledgeable about cheese and his passion is evident; he was great company and super fun and we got to sample each one before deciding which to have for our personal platter. drank wine tasted cheese it was the most amazing experience! Felt like we were in another country. He is a wonderful asset to Treehaus & enriches the whole experience. all of us even purchased MORE cheese to take home to Hawaii. \n\nSAD SIDE NOTE: brought crew for early HH oysters & wine but found it moved to late night only -- after 9pm :(. super sad for us we can no longer participate we leave too early in AM for flight home. Pls consider returning the early HH!" u"I stumbled upon this place after a small lunch with a friend and we were both drawn in by how cute the sushi donuts looked!!! The sushi donut area is located in the back of the store behind the self serve hot food and they also serve other Asian food. \nAlthough they display pictures of several different sushi donut variations they only have two kinds you can choose from: avocado salmon and ahi tuna. \nThe size of the donut was a perfect size to share as a snack between my friend and I and we were especially amused by a little heart shaped soy sauce dropper (as extra as that is). We also shared sweet potato fries which were crispy and delicious. \n\nOverall the sushi donut was cute but other than that it wasn't very special. You can instagram it and forget it. I'd have the sweet potato fries again though!" u"I'm rating this solely on the brunch experience which was pretty awful from the moment we stepped in. The service was slow they forgot one our drinks which we had to ask them about. However my biggest frustration was The French Toast. The price they charge is $16 -- for ONE small piece of subpar bread. I live in New York and understand high prices but that is just insulting to the customer. \nMy boyfriend left starving and ended up making breakfast when we got home. We could spend our money anywhere and we chose to spend it there and left underwhelmed. We expressed our disappointment with the waitress and she took 10% off the bill but we couldn't see the final cost because the bottom of the receipt was ripped off. Just all together a bad experience." u'This is only for the Korean food restaurant. \n\nThe service was a bit odd. Both people stared at me in confusion as I repeated "beef tofu soup" a few times even though that\'s what\'s exactly on the menu. \n\nThe picture of the item had a few small dishes next to it. See pictures. It\'s extremely normal and common for Korean restaurants to include banchan/namul which are small assorted dishes of veggies/other small side dishes. However when I got my order of food I noticed there weren\'t any side dishes. I asked for them but was told the picture was just for show. Well I couldn\'t find them anywhere on the menu either as a side so why include pictures of food that you\'re not going to include?Not a good show trying to make the picture a bit misleading... \n\nThe meal itself was very bland. Rice was too overcooked and mushy the "beef" tofu soup consisted of maybe 4 pieces of beef the thickness of a straw and about 3 inches long each. The soup felt like it was just some spicyness added and that\'s it. \n\nSave yourself and just go to ktwon which is like 15 minutes away by foot. There\'s $13 beef tofu soup at bcd tofu house Seoul garden etc with great rice at least 5 small side dishes more beef in the soup and more flavor as well. \n\nThe grocery store/coffee is a bit overpriced which is fine as I\'m sure the rent here is insane but they\'re good quality so I\'m ok with that.' u'You know that one person who\'s just a jack (or Jill) of all trades? She\'s different than the rest because unlike many who claim to be one she truly excels in each trade.\n\nTreehaus Mima is Jill.\n\nPlease keep following my analogy here. \n\nTreehaus could potentially be another typical NYC "specialty fine deli/markets" that tries to do it all: buffet smoothie sandwich grocery store coffee bar baked goods--\nBut then let\'s also throw in: vegan options organic produce offerings in the supermarket poke station oyster nights (never been personally) wine bar...\n\nI mean overachiever much?\n\nBoy am I glad Treehaus is.\nOn top of all of its top notch offerings the service is fantastic. The staff takes the time to ask/know regular\'s names they engage in smart conversation if you offer it and obviously the most important-- they\'re attentive to your needs.\n\nFood is fresh colorful and real. Mix of healthy and homemade comfort. \nAlso have free wifi.\n\nMust try:\n- Any of their baked goods (they now offer goodies from Baked my fav NYC bakery)\n- Brunch \n- Poke bar \n- Parfait with fresh fruit' u'The good: Decent quality food paired with pay by container (vs. weight) can make for good value.\n\nThe bad: On more than one occasion the staff here have attempted to overcharge me. Beware when the scanner malfunctions and the cashier inputs the price manually. The first time the cashier tried to charge me $4.99 for a small Chobani yogurt. The shelf price is $2.49 which is already expensive (you can get the same yogurt across the street at the Food Emporium for $1.79). I pointed this out to him and he input the correct price. Honest mistake no big deal right? Wrong. Today another cashier tried to charge me $5.99 for the same Chobani yogurt. Yes. $6 for a small Chobani believe it. And $3.99 for an HonestAde ($2.49 shelf price as well). I pointed this out and she put in the correct prices. Very shady practices.' u"Cool place to grab coffee sandwiches smoothies baked goods hot meals gelato flowers groceries or sit at a regular restaurant. This place has everything you could need or want and certain parts (grocery storecoffee seating areas) are open 24 hours. You can order food or coffee to go/sit at the many open tables or dine in at the restaurant. The employees here are also always really nice and helpful. I live near here and this place is so convenient whenever I want a quick bite to eat or a need to pick up a few groceries. They also have live music events sometimes so it's cool to sit and enjoy your food or grocery shop while listening to great live music by local artists." u"The staffs at this place should learn how to make efficient service! I won't waste my anymore time here." u'This place was on our way to sightseeing. It caught my eye so we decided to give it a try. And we are soooo glad we did.\n\nWe got a smoothie with an almond milk base banana strawberry blueberry and raspberries. This thing was so fresh it was a perfect way to start our journey. I gave it a good ol 12/10. Until we meet again!\n\nI loved it so much that before leaving back home we got one for the way. \n\nWill deff recommend and have once i come back' u'First of all if you have any questions about the cheese tasting talk to Javier the cheese expert! He is very knowledgeable and you can tell he actually enjoys being "the cheese guy"  at Treehaus Mima. He let us sample a good number of his favorite cheeses ( all were very good or very interesting) and basically gave us a mini cheese class session. They have a good happy hour deal on oysters and beer (and rose wine.) We went there on Wednesday early evening and it was quiet and chill for the conversation and the live music in the background was a nice plus.' u"Tried this today for the first time great place! Like a hybrid of Sunac and Gotham West and really good quality at a reasonable price.  \n\nThe buffet is a fantastic deal ($11 for a really filling dinner bowl of whatever you want I chose the kale salad pasta teriyaki chicken & lamb). And the poke/korean shop is also really good GREAT sushi. Going to check out the oyster bar now ($5 rose). \n\nIt's not that crowded yet but I'm sure that will change. In the meantime it's probably the best deal in the neighborhood." u"First and foremost Treehaus MiMA is a bodega (deli? Mart? Whatever a new york bodega means to you). In that sense it fulfills all the standard requirements: fresh produce dry goods sandwich/deli counter coffee and juice bars. \n\nHowever  the reason why I felt compelled to leave a (5 starred) review was because it does all of those things but does it so much better. \n\nPer the millenial market Treehaus carries all the requisite organic gluten free vegan nongmo local artisanal stuff like the small batch chocolate chip cookies that you can never find anywhere but at a dark corner in Whole Foods. An extensive chips and snacks offering that leaves you feeling good about such healthy choices. They have an amazing beer section with the most aesthetic labels and brewery names you've probably never heard of. (Tried Queens Brewery lager today for the first time didn't disappoint). But not to worry the coronas and coors are still in there too. Most interestingly they had a k-beauty sheet mask & products aisle stocked with with a large variety of actually popular products. Speaking of asian products they had a couple aisles just for japanese/korean snacks! Niceuuu\n\nBeyond that I was impressed with the quality of their hot food buffet style but with prices capped at $8-11 for lunch. That's mad cheap for the city considering any random bodega buffet that charges by weight comes to a minimum of like $13 at least. AND the food was actually really good! Also their cold brew was great. \n\nDidnt try the poke/oyster/juice bar/bakery but I'm just happy to see that such choices exist. Apparently they have brunch too? Now if I only lived nearby or if Treehaus were to buy the shitty Gracefully in my neighborhood...sigh a girl can dream. \n\nOh the staff were oddly really nice and attentive two different people asking me if I needed anything as they walked by. You won't see that at a M2M thats for sure." u'Oh my goodness! So good! The buffet was amazing and the options were great. I just wish u could eat here more often.' u'I had spicy beef soup "yukgyejang" and fried tofu at the poke place in Mima. Friend tofu was crispy and fresh the soup was also very fresh and good. I had it on rainy day and it was perfect quick dinner. was not too heavy or spicy. If you expect to eat something for more than 1hr and have all the traditional condiments and side dishes this is May not be the place for it. (Yea this place is located in the food court/deli)\nI am happy to see new delicious and healthy Asian addition in time sq.' u'My family and I stumbled upon Treehaus Mima while waiting for a show. We wanted a quick yet delicious brunch. We were so happy when reading the menu and walked in and was warmly greeted and seated right away.\n\nThe atmosphere was so fun inside and the menu was impressive. The staff was great too very accommodating. The restaurant portion of this establishment was new so there were a few hiccups but that staff made it right and went above and beyond to help. I loved my meal of steam mussels. I cannot wait to go back and see how they flourish as they get the restaurant scene under their belts!' u'I had passed by a few weeks back stopped in and realized the have a buffet breakfast on the weekends and are open 24 hours. Today I got there around 8:30 on the weekend and the buffet was set up on one side for breakfast food (eggs sausage chicken sausage fried eggs suiting in I think ketchup bacon and ham- in the future I will come a little later since as I was leaving all of the fresh fruit was coming out. Keep in mind-this not an all you can eat and it is pricey-you fill your large or small dish once-refills cost. After getting your food you get on line for coffee. My dish was heavy my food is getting cold and there are 3 people ahead of me for coffee. When I got my coffee I asked where the wooden trays were I had seen people with and they were behind the counter-not helpful when your hands are full. The food however was very good. If you want an omelette panini sandwiches head to the back-off to one side is the smoothie bar and floral area. In the center is the supermarket and on the other side the wine bar. The supermarket area items are prohibitively expensive (the rent here must be crippling-it is a very large space)) organic and there is an entire section catering to the Asian palette. I would return but there needs to be more direction if it is a first time other than the arrows on the floor. A person floating about would be helpful. The price of the buffet and other items would be a deterrent for some to return' u"Stumbled into this place after a show.   This is an eclectic mash of a hybrid international grocery store  made to order cafeteria/buffet  barista bar and high end deli under one roof.  It's a bit away from the chaos and is a place to sit quietly before or after a show.  In the corner hidden away is a Korean Poke Bowl stand-  you place an order for either take out or dine in.  Ample seating for guests at tables scattered around the building or at the bar.  The grocery section also has international groceries as well a fairly well stocked section of Japanese/Korean skin care products.  Not sure what the theme or POV of this place is supposed to be but who cares as long as it's entertaining and the food is decent.  Give this place a try!" u"I love this location because its nice and chill and a bit away from all the chaos of midtown. I had the poke here and it was amazing! The service was very friendly and even though I was new to this spot they made my friends and I feel comfortable. \n\nThe poke have korean twists and all the flavors go hand in hand. The sushi donut was great as well~ Can't wait to go back to try their other items. \n\nThey also have lots if vegetarian options if thats what youre into! \n\nThe dumplings and the hodukk was great too" u"Yesterday we got dinner from their hot food/salad bar and we ate there.  Although the selection of items wasn't extensive everything was delicious and very fresh-tasting.  Also the price was a *bargain*; you can fill up a (big) plate for only $13 (note that take-out [in very small cartons] is by weight).  The interior space is very large and attractive including some nice (small) paintings on a few walls by the seating area - and speaking of the latter there's a decent amount of seating (at long tables) on one side by the front.\n\nThe cashier by the food/salad bar (Arthur) was *very* friendly & helpful and a young woman working on the other side (by the seating) - Joan - was also very friendly.  In fact everyone working there was pleasant and helpful.  Also; the place is super-clean and they were playing nice music throughout our meal (an entire Cold Play album)."],0.7184,0.304,0.696,0.0
185.Zen Ramen & Sushi,[u"This. Is. Delicious.\n\nI don't know ramen well but I know good flavor and this has it. Had the vegetable and tofu ramen and my friend had the tonkatsu pork ramen.\n\nJust fantastic. I'll be returning today with my husband for my birthday. Enjoy the pictures!\n\nI WILL say that it is not fast food so don't expect it quickly but if you're there with a friend you won't mind the time. :)" u"I'm not originally from NY but from all the ramen places I've tried this is high up there. I got the Spicy Vegetarian Ramen option ($16) and it was delicious. The spice was just right and not too overwhelming. There was plenty of flavors to go along with ramen and added lots of interesting taste. Overall definitely recommend to fellow vegetarians!\n\nKnocked off one star because of how expensive it was!" u'Came here for dinner after paint nite and it was a good place to get out of the cold\n\nPros:\n- Yummy reasonable priced sushi \n- Complimentary ice cream with yelp check in was delicious \n\nCons:\n- Place is tight - limited seating so definitely get here early\n- It was also very difficult to hear one another I think this place is fine if you come with one other person but for larger groups it would be difficult to communicate with one another' u"Considering the exceptional price for a combination of rolls and the quality and flavor of ramen broth this place deserves a 5/5 from me!\n\nMy friend and I ate lunch here on a rainy day in the city- we split a 3-roll combo ($11 listed on the menu) and a bowl of their tonkotsu shoyu ramen. The rolls were fresh and flavorful. And filling! The shrimp tempura one was not too greasy or crispy- it was delicious! They have so many options for rolls. We stuck with the shrimp tempura spicy tuna and salmon and avocado. \n\nThis is a great place for anyone who is indecisive like me and can't commit to just one type of sushi roll!! \n\nThe ramen was also exceptional. The broth was an excellent blend and the char siu pork pieces were thick and extremely well seasoned. \n\nOverall our bill came out of be around $26. Service was good and the food was great. I would definitely come back!" u"This was a great find. Granted we searched on Yelp and walked to a few other places before we found Zen Ramen & Sushi but glad we kept going. \n\nSuper chill Japanese spot with some very good food! The tonokotsu shoyu ramen was great - there were 2 thick slices of roast pork belly in there your choice of noodle thickness/style spinach menma and some other greens. Great flavor broth!\n\nThe seaweed salad was much larger a portion that I was expecting and I think I ate the whole thing. Along with the Spicy Mama roll which contained spicy tuna spicy yellowtail spicy salmon crunch and asparagus. Not overly sauced which I appreciated! Wrapped in a pink almost iridescent rice wrapper.\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly. Restrooms were clean. Prices were reasonable. What's not to love?" u"Solid take out spot for lunch. They pack your noodles really well making sure to separate the soup and the noodles. I'm actually quite impressed since most places leave them together and the noodles end up getting soggy. All of the ramen comes with generous portions of toppings...the udon unfortunately is lacking. It's pretty much just noodles and 3 fishcakes. \n\nThe food is actually quite good too. They use high quality ingredients the produce is fresh and the soup is flavorful and delicious. This will definitely be my solid rainy day delivery spot!" u'Our favorite ramen spot so far.\n\nZen has a good selection to pick from with 4 different broths 4 different noodle types and an array of toppings to customize to your preferences for the day. And both the bonito broth and the pork broth taste great. For you spicy lovers out there the spice level is good and decently spicy (unlike typical midtown "spicy").\n\nHighly recommend the Spicy (or normal if you can\'t do spicy) Tonkatsu Ramen.\n\nPrice is reasonable and there are happy hours 5-7p on weekdays to go for. Atopthat service is great; servers are attentive an friendly.\n\nLook forward to coming again after work.' u"Good for take out. Working late in the city makes it hard to find places that you can take out for a large group that won't take long. We ordered several items including the Crunchy Roll Rock Shrimp the Ell Roll Chicken Katsu and the Chef's Sashimi platter that cost about $85. It was a quick turn around from when we ordered it to when we had to pick it up.\n\nWhen we went into the restaurant to pick up the food we noticed a very strong fishy smell. It made us glad we didn't choose to eat in. When we got back to our office we are our food and were pleasantly surprised. The food tasted fresh and of good quality. The only thing that put us off was the smell. Other than that our experience was ok." u"I ordered take out via the Yelp app on a Friday night. The estimated wait time was 10-35 so to be safe we arrived half an hour after we ordered.\n\nAs a group we ordered $80+ worth of food so the restaurant also gave us some edamame for free!\n\nI personally ordered the chirashi bowl for $27. It was 15 pieces of an assortment of thick-cut fish paired with a bowl of rice. The fish was really fresh and there was salmon tuna octopus and a few other kinds I couldn't recognize. Very yummy! :)\n\nThe restaurant got our entire order right! The food and service was decent and I'd try more of their menu." u"My coworkers and I were craving sushi and this was near our office and had food ratings. We ordered pickup via yelp app (~) \n\nETA was about 10-35 minutes. One of our coworkers had to do some shopping and by the time she finished our food was ready. \n\nI ordered chicken katsu eel avocado roll and spicy tuna roll. \n\nThe rice of the chicken katsu was a bit too mushy and dry. I wasn't really a fan of it. The katsu was good but the longer I went without eating it the drier it got. \n\nEel avocado roll was good. A couple of pieces didn't hold up very well but still good taste. \n\nNo complaints on the spicy salmon. \n\nThey provide regular soy sauce and low sodium so sauce which is nice. \n\nI'd definitely give this place a try again." u"At first glance i thought this was a ramen joint. Well it is but I experienced inner Zen when I was able to order up an inexpensive and tasty sushi lunch here! (see what I did there?)\n\nIt's a combo ramen and sushi spot and from what I experienced along with many others here they do both pretty darn good.\n\nThe place itself is very clean bright and features a nice Asian specific decor. There is plenty of seating at smaller two person tables while the main room is anchored by a large U-shaped communal table for larger groups. \n\nI ordered up a sushi lunch special which was solid. Very fresh. Tuna roll and salmon roll for only $9 which comes with a soup or salad. Can of diet coke for $2. Very easy on the wallet.\n\nService was prompt and my food came out quickly. Bonus points for having the original Blade movie playing on the large flatscreen. Killer lunch!" u'Ramen is adequate but not authentic or flavorful. Had the tonkotsu ramen. Pork broth does not have intensity and additions like canned bamboo shoots and corn do not add to the experience. Arugula in ramen? The components of a great ramen are very cheap. Why skimp on something that costs pennies per dhish but add much customer satisfaction? The seasoned egg was runny but not enough flavor. But it is a Chinese owned venue so authenticity is out the window! The only saving grace is the fatty pork is decent. \nHave I bitched enough? I love ramen and will not return for it here. Had high hopes...' u"Zen Ramen is a hidden gem tucked away in the factory area away from the 34th street tourist area. Every time I'm around this area and I want ramen I always come here. \n\nI haven't tried their sushi but their ramen is definitely influenced by the Chinese (most of their staff are and speak Chinese) such as the ingredients they used. I don't mind it but if I want authentic Japanese ramen I prefer to go somewhere else. \n\nFor a big bowl of noodles with juicy and tender pork slices it's worth the $13-$15." u"What a gem in midtown! I went with a friend for dinner on a Friday night sat by the bar area and ordered a ton of food namely the cucumber roll eel avocado roll seaweed salad edemame and fried green tea ice cream (which I now realize you could check into Yelp for a free one). The sushi really hit the spot and for such an inexpensive price too. I was actually obsessed with the seaweed salad - best I've ever had. The ambiance is also great. I'll be back to try their special rolls." u'Small place but nice ambience and great food. Only 2 options for Vegetarians. They can customize the spice level. Easy to get table if in small group.' u"Was going to try Ramen for the first time as this place is a favorite of my coworker. We planned a birthday lunch for seven people. Made a reservation for a set time when we got there 10 minutes early the restaurant was completely packed and the hostess then told us that due to our reservation no being confirmed by a phone call that we never received they gave away our table. (WHO DOES THAT) reservations should be kept. The hostess then went on to tell us that we should wait 20 mins for a table. One of my coworkers is 9 months pregnant we wouldn't allow her to wait 20mins on her feet to be seated. We all decided that this place wasn't worth the headache the unwelcoming aura or the nasty hostess and we left and went somewhere we felt welcome. \nThis place should work on how they treat their patrons midtown is fillies with other places that will take their business" u'The sushi is okay. Super Americanized and not very fresh. The fish portions in the rolls are scarce and diluted with crunch and various sauces. \nThe ramen is not bad. Most people seem to order it. I got the Tonkotsu. The broth was okay and the noodles were tender but the pork belly was burnt and mostly inedible. Partner ordered shrimp tom yum rice n noodle soup. He did like his spicy lemongrass broth. \nIf you check-in you supposedly receive a free green tea ice cream. The fine print says dine in only. We told our waiter and he said "okay later." We asked about it at the end of the meal to be told it\'s only for the weekday. Lol. Okay. Clearly a cheapout tactic that made me question the whole meal. Meh.' u'Delicious!\n\nI can only review the take out - but I received the Spicy Vegetable Ramen (I got the Udon Noodles instead) and the Takoyaki.  \n\nThe food arrived SUPER fast hot and delicious.  Highly recommend this place!  I have no complaints whatsoever.  I might visit them next time.' u"I go out and search for ramen and Indian food whenever I go to another city. I had a really disappointing bowl last week in NYC and was desperate to try another. \n\nThis restaurant isn't far from Times Square but doesn't seem to be touristy at all. Most of the clientele in this small place seem to be Japanese. It had a good crowd for three pm. There's a bar for people dining alone and a few tables in the back. \n\nAs I said ramen was my only choice. I was pleased to see there were two options a regular veg and a spicy one. The wavy noodles weren't as thick or fresh as I like but they were soft with just the right amount of texture to them. The broth was flavorful and filled with mushrooms green onions tofu with an amazing sweet sauce and asparagus. There was a bit of vegetables in every bite. $15 for the bowl but it came with a little salad with ginger dressing. \n\nOf course I had to take them up on the free Green Tea ice cream. It had a pleasant mild green tea taste was was a generous portion. Overall I would definitely recommend it to someone else (but I can't return  there are too many places to try in the city!)." u"After seeing some yelp reviews I decided to give this place a try. Close to my daughter's ballroom dancing class. What a great decision! Staff were super attentive and the food was soooooo good! We even got free green tea ice cream. I will definitely return again soon."],0.4019,0.403,0.597,0.0
171.Ippudo,[u"I heard about this place from a friend at work and it was right on the money. Ive been there twice for lunch and the food is great here. It does get busy however. Larger groups probably have to wait a little longer as its a small place. Kind of tight but there is a decent amount of seating. You check in with the host/hostess and you wait to be seated from there. I think they just opened for dinner as well. \nIve tried the Miso Ramen Soup which is vegetarian and the Karake Spicy Ramen which was delicious. The Miso was good but i thought the Karake was better. \nThere's a also a rice bowl option for $3 and there is the Karake or the Unagi(eel). Ive tried both and they are both very good. \nYou can also add stuff to your soup like an egg and about 4 other items which i don't recall what they were. It does add to the bill though for each item. \nThe staff is super nice and polite and the food comes out pretty quickly. \nI'll be back to try some other things on the menu." u"Few locations around and even the basic miso Ramen with taxes and tips will get you close to $20.  I prefer Totto Ramen & Naruto Ramen in term of taste and price.  The waitress was friendly when I got seated.\n\nThe hostness was not too cool.  It was really loud in there when checking in at lunch time and I asked if there was a wait for even 1 person at the noodle bar and she said I told you already you have to wait and just pointed to the waiting area.  Anyway after reading all the other yelpers review I decide to stay and tried it out anyway.\n\nNot the best Ramen I have in NYC for that price so I won't be back for $20 ramen and attitude while been seated.  Its thin and soft  and the soup base was flavor.  Quantity of the noodle and meat was on the light side and probably won't get you full if you are really hungry.  Modern dinner room and clean location." u"I like this new location because you can get Ippudo ramen here without a long wait.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon and there's no line my friend and I were seated right away. \n\nThe restaurant is smaller than the other locations in the city it has a bar in the waiting area.   And in the dining room there is an L-shaped table by the ramen kitchen.   There are a couple tables that mostly come with 2 seats  or 4 seats.  The decor is very basic with a lot of wooden elements.  The room is very bright (almost too bright) with ample lighting.  \n\nWe ordered the edamame which came with yuzu salt.  It was a delightful start to our meal.  We also ordered pork buns.  I like the pork buns from Ippudo as their sauce is so much better than the typical hoisin sauce used by a lot of Asian restaurants.   The sauce used in the Ippudo buns has a spicy kick to it it complements the flavor of the chashu pork really nicely.  And I like that it is not too saucy unlike the hoisin sauce explosion you would experience at certain Asian restaurants when you order the pork buns.   \n\nFor the ramen we ordered the Akamaru which came with garlic oil and the secret sauce. I would recommend adding the egg topping to this ramen  their boiled eggs have a runny center unlike the hard boiled eggs you would get at some other ramen places.  The secret sauce the pork based broth and garlic oil create a great pool of flavors for the ramen.  The noodles are cooked just right with a medium firmness to it.  This bowl of ramen would have you slurping.  It's delicious!!  The 2 pieces of chashu pork that came with the noodles were flavorful and well marinated.   It was a very satisfying meal. \n\nOne drawback is that we were told they do not serve hot tea.  They only serve iced jasmine tea.  The iced jasmine tea is good but I always prefer to have a cup of hot tea after I finish a bowl of ramen.   \n\nOverall I would recommend coming to this location if you don't want to wait a couple hours to have a bowl of Ippudo ramen." u'THE SHOP\n\n"Yet another Ippudo..." was the first thought that crossed my mind upon hearing that there would now be a third location in New York. To many Ippudo is the McDonalds of the ramen scene. While I can\'t argue given the vast amount of locations this ramen chain has established I will re-state what I claimed in my previous review of the downtown location: the soup is consistent the Tonkotsu is creamy rich and silky and the noodles are always paired correctly. \n\nWhether or not you feel that the incredible success of Ippudo detracts from the authenticity of the ramen is up to personal opinion however Ippudo does Tonkotsu right and that is a fact. \n\nTHE RAMEN\n\nUnlike the two other New York locations the menu at the 46th street shop is focused on KISSANE broth which is a blend of pork and chicken. The broth is lighter but still has Ippudo\'s signature silky smooth texture. The menma is cut into thick strips and has no tang and the noodles are thin straight and delightful. The pork was perfectly prepared as well with just the right ratio of fat to meat. \n\nThe ramen here is clean well portioned and knowing Ippudo\'s formulaic approach to it\'s ramen it is safe to say that it will be consistent. \n\nSERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE\n\nWhile the ramen may not be vastly different at this location the atmosphere and service certainly is. A vibrant tapestry gives way to a small waiting room that is intended for to-go orders. As you enter the main room the room itself is brightly lit and decorated with light beige wood in various arrangements with tables to match. \n\nThere is an abundance of servers present who promptly greet guests refill water and drop checks on a dime. \n\nOVERALL\n\nThis location maintains Ippudo\'s claim to fame: consistant good and well presented ramen with an over the top presentation. Servers scream "welcome" to you in Japanese as you enter and bowls fly out of the kitchen. This location is geared towards the mid-town business crowd that is looking for a quick in and out experience. \n\nThe soup is delicious but not all that different from the other Ippudo locations. If you are in the area and need a noodle fix this is a great option (albiet expensive). If you are looking for something unique and special perhaps venture elsewhere as this is basically a speedy brightly lit version of the Hells Kitchen Ippudo.' u"This place just open and I had amazing service. Came here for lunch and had there amazing pork bun tasted just like those really good heros you crave from her really good bodega. I also had the pleasure of having there pork soup that was full of amazing bold flavor. Luckily it wasn't crowded and I was able to be seated right away and I had the atmosphere was very modern and welcoming. \n\nSadly they close early and I am not able to pick up dinner on the way home but I will catch them one day!" u'This new Ippudo location opened a week ago - which is why they still serve only 4 ramen dishes. They don\'t have the shio soup or the miso soup ramen yet. \n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated really new with friendly staff. I came here round 1:30 PM and there was no wait - I assume it\'s because not a lot of people know that this new location opened yet so better come here fast before word gets out! \n\nI ordered the akamaru ramen and the broth was amazing. It\'s an explosion of flavor the right amount of saltiness and creaminess. "Umami" is probably the right word to describe it. It smells amazing and the noodles were cooked perfectly. However for the price you pay the amount of meat and vegetable they gave is not really worth it.\n\nI got 1 small piece of cabbage in my bowl of ramen and 2 really thin pieces of pork. Not only that I the extra egg I ordered was not marinated correctly it was just like a normal boiled egg usually Ippudo\'s egg would be marinated in soy sauce for a while which makes it more flavorful I didn\'t like paying $2 for a normal boiled egg. Yes it was yolky but tasteless. \n\nOverall Ippudo could improve by not being so stingy with its cabbage LOL. \n\nThey also don\'t have chili flakes or shoyu sauce on the side like other Ippudo has.' u'Overall: mediocre \n\nService: I went when it first opened so they were still figuring things out\n\nFood\nRamen: first bowl I got had a strain of hair in it showed it to the waitress and she went and got me a new bowl. The texture of the noodle was on the softer side and I would have preferred al dente\n\nShisito peppers\nMade perfectly; the salt on the side was yummy...\n\nFor the price quality and flavor not sure I would return...' u"RAMEN- I had the ICHIRAKU it's a classic shout-broth with bonito fish dash. It was topped with pork belly  scallions umami egg menma and naruto . The umami egg was like a hard boiled egg that was not fully hard boiled.  It gave a nice touch to the soup.  The pork belly had a very nice flavor and the cabbage was sweet and tasty.  They also gave you the option  for $2 to buy additional noodles if you still had broth leftover.  The staff were helpful and attentive" u"When I heard they opened an Ippudo around the corner from my workplace I was elated. Finally had the time to try it out today. They are only open during lunch from 11AM-3:30PM. I didn't arrive til almost 3PM so there was no wait by then. \n\nBeing newly opened they have a limited ramen menu selection that range about $16. They do have a lunch set that includes either a fried chicken bowl or an unagi rice bowl for an additional $3. I had the chicken today and I was a little underwhelmed. There were only a few small clusters of chicken and waaaaaay too much rice. \n\nNow onto the ramen. This location is unique in the sense that they don't serve tonkatsu ramen YET. They're due to have it too once they open for dinner later in the fall. The kasane broth they served is a mixture of pork and chicken so not as rich and heavy as the tonkotsu. It was still extremely flavorful in my opinion. The noodles are of the thin variety ( I prefer the thick wavy ones but to each their own. ) \n\nOverall a great addition to the midtown lunch scene. If you have the time for it definitely try it out once. I can imagine it being very busy during the prime lunch hours as the seating is limited. I also saw a bar in the front that had a variety of take out options but none seemed to be the ramen." u"This place is dangerously close to my work. It's so close that it poses clear and present danger to the holy temple that is my body. A ramen a day does not keep the doctors away. \n\nOh well. \n\nI'd say the ramen at this location is as good as the other two Ippudo locations. The setup here is on the casual side with a number of two-tops that makes it a perfect lunch date spot. I'm personally partial to the bonito broth the slightly less guilt-inducing version that caters to those who prefer something clear and shoyu-based. It's definitely lightER though I'm sure my sodium levels are skyrocketing just as much. Maybe ease up just a tad on the salt?\n\nSomeone else pointed out that noise level was an issue. I didn't find it particularly perturbing though the sporadic yowl to greet visitors can jolt you out of the normal course of conversation. \n\nAlas farewell my cholesterol control program." u"Ramentastic! Okay so I am a little biased...I literally die for noodles of any sort....so they basically had me at noodles. I've been wanting to go for a while to their other locations but have heard about the long lines. This location is very manageable we waited maybe 15 minutes tops. Service is very friendly and quick. Since we didn't know a ton about ramen the waiter made some recommendations everything was  excellent. Definitely get the buns as well! So happy this place is a few blocks from my office right in time for the cold! Can't wait to try all the ramen!" u"They have a few locations around manhattan and the two that I've been two kick-ass for ramen and cooked food appetizers. All the ramen I've had there have really flavorful broth and a rich delicious taste. The pork and chicken buns are also great; not cheap and saucy. So far nothing I've had there has been a let down. \n\nThe staff are friendly and energetic. It is a lively place.\n\nI will be going back." u"Looking for ramen on a rainy afternoon we got lucky as this place was just around the corner from our hotel. Open during lunch hours only the place is a bit small and they don't allow outside food or drinks. We had to leave our coffee in the front. Wanting to make the most of our visit we ordered the Ippudo salad the pork belly buns and two different ramens. The Ippudo salad was a generous portion of kale and pumpkin seeds with an avocado hidden beneath. Tastes great would recommend. The pork belly buns were fantastic. Pork was juicy flavoured beautifully with just enough sauce. The bun was soft and held up well. Soo good. I ordered the ramen with fish broth. It had all the toppings I wanted already. The broth was light not too salty and a nice balance. You could smell the fishy-ness however so would not recommend if that's not your thing. Also would not recommend adding bamboo to your noodles definitely not worth the four dollars for three tiny pieces of bamboo shoots. Other than that great bowl of ramen. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Would definitely come back. Glad to know they have multiple locations around New York." u'I have heard about Ippudo so many times because of the recommendations from my friends but this is the first time that I have tried it. The other locations always seem to have long lines so I was always hesitant on giving Ippudo a try. Since this location opened recently there was no line at all. The interior was appealing and the noise level was very low which is a bonus. Today I got the Akamaru Kasane and the broth was rich and not too salty. There was a great balance. The noodles however were a bit too soft for my liking. But I do like that the noodles are thin.' u"As is typical of the ippudo's I have been to in the other locations the food was very good. I got the akamaru kasane and pork belly buttons. This location though is definitely much smaller than their location near union square. Just like the other ones though there is a super long line here. But it's worth it. It's pricy so it won't be a regular thing. But i will go back." u"Don't try to have a conversation here it is so loud - they all yell at the top of their lungs every time someone walks in which is every 30 seconds. \n\nDon't try to take anything you don't eat home. They do not wrap up any food! My friend ate a few noodles and wasn't feeling well so thought taking the full bowl of ramen home would be perfect. NOPE! Not allowed. We asked to make an exception I mean it is a $16 bowl of uneaten ramen but they would not. I'm sorry but she bought that food so technically she should be able to decide what she prefers to do with it. We will not be back which is a shame since we work 100 feet away and were really looking forward to this place opening." u"Surprised to find this new location and wanna give a try.\nThe service is good but the ramen is not good as what I expected. The noodle is quite different from the one at SoHo location. undisputed the old location is betterit doesn't have too many kinds of food here." u"This place is amazing! It's a little on the pricey side but hey when you're in the best city in the world you gotta live it up. The ramen is great so authentic and robust flavor. The waiters know a little Japanese and the atmosphere is sincere as well. I highly recommend trying their pork and ramen dishes. They know how to cook. The drinks are great as well. The one draw back is that it's too busy. There's usually a 2 hour wait...for a reason. So put your name down by walking in and you're on your way to a great lunch or dinner. Well worth it." u'Very nice staff good food clean and welcoming a good addition to the neighborhood. Make sure you notice you can add topping and get additional rice bowls I had  the unigorice' u'I was lucky enough to find out about this grand opening location before it got too crazy busy. Put my name down for 6 and got sat in 10 minutes. Service is fast and employees are friendly and knowledgeable. Food was flavorful and tasteful! The only con is that it is a little oily and the add on egg was a little over cooked. But still I fully enjoyed my meal as did the rest of my party. Definitely would recommend hopefully I can come back again before the wait becomes ridiculous.'],0.7845,0.441,0.559,0.0
152.Larb Ubol,[u"The media attention and high ratings on this platform not that it means anything with an amateur user base empowered with phones thinking they are sophisticated reviewers suggest something special.\n\nSpecial indeed.\n\nSee 9th Ave is clogged with sweet cookie cutter non authentic Americanized 'Thai' food. \n\nThis place is not that.\n\nThis is authentic Northern Thai cuisine that don't f around. Get the Pad ped. Now.\n\nGet the fermented sausage. Now.\n\nGet going here now.\n\nAnd leave these other crappy 9th street places alone." u"Really good service! The drunken noodles were really good. I like spicy food and ordered very spicy which they actually delivered on. Others at my table ordered medium spice and said they would go with mild next time so be warned.\n\nThey don't have a huge number vegetarian options but have enough to find something you'll like." u"This is my fav Thai place in town.\nEverything we ordered here were on points. I would def want to come back to this place for lunch.\nTheir larb gai was amazing... it's basically a chicken salads but the spices they used on it were well balanced and with a bit of a crunch. I have tried many larb gai in different venues. None of them were on par to what I had here...  of course this can be a personal taste too but I do like this place the best.\nTheir Thai iced tea is very good too.\nI will be back :)" u'I came here recently for dinner on a Wednesday evening with a few friends and we loved the food here. The restaurant was quiet but there were still customers inside which was a good sign for a quiet restaurant. The service was friendly and prompt as well.\n\nAs for the food we ordered the following dishes as they seemed pretty popular according to Yelp:\n\nPad Thai\nPad Sew Ew\nPuk Boong Moo Krob\nPad Ped with Veggie Duck\n\nI have to admit none of the dishes really stood out to us and made us go "WOW" but at the same time we liked every dish we ordered. The Pad Thai and Pad Sew Ew were moist but not overly so and had good flavoring on them. The Pad Thai was a bit on the sweet side though. The Puk Boong Moo Krob had a ton of greens mixed in which was exactly what we wanted. The Pad Ped with Veggie Duck was probably my least favorite though because the ingredients mixed in weren\'t my cup of tea. The serving sizes could have been a bit bigger but that\'s nitpicking.\n\nThere was one thing that I really loved though and it was the Thai Ice Tea. To be honest it might have been the best Thai Ice Tea I had ever ordered! It was perfectly sweet and served in a huge cup. Surprisingly for such a simple drink it made a lasting impression on me.\n\nFor a low-key casual restaurant Larb Ubol was just what the doctor ordered. Food was good service was attentive and atmosphere was perfect for a catch-up dinner with friends.' u"We came here for dinner on a Sunday night half an hour before they closed and luckily they sat us. For a group of 8 service was quick! 18% gratuity was added so we didn't have to do the math.\n\n// Food\nI shared the chicken pad Thai and crispy pork with spicy basil sauce over rice with a friend. The pad Thai was delicious but didn't come with lime. I asked for chili pepper flakes since it didn't come spicy either. The sauce of the pork dish had a nice kick to it and it was good going back and forth between the two dishes. Also big portions! I was stuffed. One thing is that the pork seemed like it would be better as a snack than a meal because it was really fried and dry.\n\n// Service\nService was great. It took a while to get a waiter to take our orders but once they were in the food came out fairly quickly albeit a bit staggered." u'Just quite odd really. Flavors poor and meat was fatty. Also the platting was very unappetizing. Service however was nice and friendly.' u"Larb Ubol is a one dish wonder meaning I would come back here again and again just for one dish. That one magical thing for me is the Guay Thiew Nam Tok. It's dark rice noodle soup with morning glory mixed scallion cilantro bean sprout and ground pork. Sounds simple right? Not so! The dark soup has a most intense and layered flavor complex. I don't know what they put in there but this magic sauce is seriously addicting. It's ever so slightly sweet salty tangy and so rich that I am salivating as I type right now. \n\nService is friendly. Decor is minimal. Great for solo dining as long as you don't end up next to two screaming toddlers throwing around their fried rice.*\n\n*Seriously this *always* happen to me. Why." u'9th Avenue has no shortage of Thai places that\'s for sure. If you\'re near the Javits or another West side venue it\'s almost automatic you\'re going to get Thai afterwards.\n\nThis place got good yelp reviews so I thought it\'d be a good spot for our large-ish group. While they accommodated our group\'s size there were some hiccups.\n\nFirst they were VERY prompt with the water refills. The service was quick and pleasant. However the waitress said "we don\'t serve appetizers" which left us all incredulous. A male server intervened and said he\'d bring out the wings as "starters."\n\nMy chicken tasted reheated and that is my least favorite taste in the world. The pad Thai noodles were dry. Everything I tried was super mediocre.' u"I've been eyeing this place for a while from their Yelp reviews. Inside the restaurant it says 'Michelin Rated.' Pretty doubtful. \n\nI picked up their pad Thai recently and it was terrible. For the same price of $12 I'd rather go up a few blocks into Hell's Kitchen where there are a bunch of Thai restaurants around and get something else there. \n\nLarb Ubol has fine interior. Not too cute or cozy not that authentic but not terrible. \n\nThe pad Thai that I received was completely dry and the sauce / seasoning was not mixed through. there were lumps of noodles that were untouched with the sauce. I ordered steamed tofu as the protein -- it was completely dried if not hard. It was all sub par. I wouldn't go back." u'Pretty good Thai restaurant.  Not a huge location but for a Tuesday evening around rush hour it was sort of crowded. I met a friend for dinner. The service was somewhat attentive. My friend had a spicy noodle dish with shrimp and I had the broccoli rabe with crispy pork. The serving was just right and not too spicy as I requested. We ordered wine at $7 per glass. My friend questioned the pout size so they next glasses we had were a little more generous. \n\nFYI Rice is considered an additional item and there is an extra fee for it. I decided to skip the rice but they had a few different kinds to choose from.' u"Cute little place. It's tiny and delicious! Came here as a tourist looking for Thai Isan food which is very similar to Laotian food in style. Was not disappointed. They have wonderful dishes with crispy pork and basil leaves papaya salad and of course the staple-sticky rice.  So much flavor and texture and the food was very filling.  Found the papaya salad a tad bland so if you're into it maybe ask for more Thai chili or fish sauce mixed in it. The crispy pork though-just order it!!! Order a Beer Lao or Thai Singha beer and just enjoy yourself. Also the sticky rice is so good so just go ahead and order two! It's reasonably priced and the service was quick. Cute place fast service and really down to earth good food." u"Stopped by for a late dinner on a Friday night around 10pm.  It wasn't that crowded and we were able to get a table with relative ease.\n\nThe ambiance is casual no frills.  For the most part it was comfortable except for the annoying table of three one table from us.  I think their hearing was not that good because they were borderline yelling at one another when they spoke.  The only thing worse than a loud talker is 2 loud talkers at the same table!!\n\nThe wait staff was ok not great.  No one greeted us for good bit so you may want to take a look at the menu and then flag someone down we were in no rush so all was good.  Once they did see us the service was decent.  I think they may be understaffed maybe 2 waitresses.\n\nWe got a Som Yum Avocado Salad Papaya and tomato salad.  I would be very careful to let them know your tolerance for spicy food.  We got their medium level and it was still spicy for me be careful or sweat like I did!  Overall great dish lots of flavor from fresh ingredients!\n\nWe also had the Pad Ped Shrimp medium spicy lots of flavor but kind of spicy so one should really ask about the level of spicy.  Overall the dish was delicious but I definitely was sweating from the level of spiciness!\n\nOverall I would go again! Food was decent service is fair.  If I'm in the hood and feeling Thai there may be a few more options." u"We heard so much about Larb Ubol I sought it out when Hugo B from Holland visited. It's south of the Port Authority a bit in no-man's land. Still every table was filled on a weeknight. Luckily they were turning over. \n\nThe giant chalkboard listed daily specials. Maybe it rarely changes. Expectations were high due to yelp reviews maybe too high. Our Toam Zabb soup with shrimp was just ok. \n\nWe ordered Moo Krob Larb (crispy pork (belly I think) salad) Gai Krob Kra Prao (chicken with basil) and Pad Ped Duck Chef Special. The larb was very good. The chicken was tasty but not the knockout in deep spices and flavors I was expecting for Isan Thai. I think we did say medium spicy. The duck sauce too heavily sweet. I hope Larb Ubol is not resting on its laurels just as it won a 2016 Michelin Bib Gourmand award.\n\nService was friendly and we enjoyed our time there. Lao Beer made a few rounds. Maybe we'll come back with no expectations and see how it goes." u"If I need a meal before during or after an event a Javits I always make sure to go here. If I lived or worked in the area I'd be here all the time too.\nLegit Thai food at affordable prices. Lunch specials are ~$10." u'Popped in the other day wandering around Ninth avenue looking for lunch.\nThe simple look and the unique menu drew me in and I thought I could possibly get the lunch special - ~$8.\n\n I thought maybe I could get the lunch special (@3:38pm) but I was too late :(  I was a little disappointed but the waiter was nice and reassured me that I would get more rice and meat :) with standard (dinner) order rather than the lunch portion.\n\nThe difference was only $2 from the lunch to the standard (Dinner) portion $8/$10. \nI went with the Kra Prao over Rice (minced chicken). \xa1Wow! was the portion large I actually went with eating half the order and saved the other half for lunch. (Portion control!)\nThe flavor was amazing with a mix of sweet and savory flavors. Basil is dominant but not over bearing. With the half of my order I took home with me I also ordered  a side of ginger rice (to try!) and it was also very tasty and reminded me of hainanese chicken rice (my favorite is from Nyonya in Little italy).\n\nSo yes I highly recommend the Kra Prao and look forward to trying other dishes at Larb Ubol who from my little research is more of a traditional Isan Thai restaurant. Not your "standard" menu but the standards are their and authentic in flavor.\n\nCheck them out and yes they have Pad Thai :P' u'Didnt expect at all.. just wanted to grab smt quick before the Hillsong. But dang it was so delish made us order one more bowl of rice.' u"Came here starving and wanting filling cheap yummy Thai food.  And that's what we got!\n\nThe service was fast and efficient.  We got chicken wings as an appetizer and were surprised that they weren't the typical bar food chicken wings but more barebones chicken wings (still good).\n\nMy friend got a fried rice and I got Pad Thai with shrimp.  The Pad Thai was sweet and the noodles were thin almost like angel hair pasta.  Not my favorite Pad Thai but it was a ton of food and tasted great.\n\nWe forgot our leftovers and came back for them.  The staff couldn't find them so they were nice enough to make me a whole new Pad Thai for free which took less than 10 minutes!" u'Ordered take out for the first time this week and was surprised by the large variety of papaya salads and larbs. I went with the papaya salad with crab - so spicy but good.\n\nWent a little later for a sit down meal with the family. We ordered crispy pork larb morning glory with crispy pork  basil with combination of different meats and tom yum soup. Service was fast and the food was good for a neighborhood Thai place.' u'So authenticlove this restaurant.. price is reasonable . One of the best Thai I have tried yet' u"Probably my favorite restaurant in Midtown which sounds like damning with faint praise but WOW I love Larb Ubol. All of the larbs are incredibly delicious the whole fish dishes are worth the price and the soups are great at lunch. I have developed a real fixation on their veggie duck dishes which I tried when I was trying to cut down on meat. They are very tasty and the ginger rice is seriously addictive - the ginger adds flavor without any bitterness. The service is great I love the little roses they make with the straw wrappers and they're even socially progressive (love the gender neutral bathroom.) Not to be catty but all the haters on here ordered pad thai. Coincidence? I think pad thai is probably the last thing I would order here because there is so much else to try. I can't wait to go back."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
95.Topaz Noodle Bar,[u'This is probably one of my favorite Thai places in New York City! So far I had: \n-The Thai iced tea Po Pia Thod (spring rolls) Pad Thai with chicken green curry with Rice and their oven baked Spare ribs.\nNot one single dish disappointed me. Everything was sooo freaking DELICIOUS! \nNothing is too spicy not too sweet and not overly cooked. You also get what you pay for. The portions are very very satisfying I never left this place hungry. I will definitely come back more often! Especially for the famous Noodles soup.' u"Yum yum yum! Omgod the Thai iced tea was as big as my hand and perfect. I got northern style curry noodles and my goodness they were delicious ! The broth was thicker and the noodles thin (think angel hair) and they were perfect together. It's a decent sized bowl and very full so good portion for your $15. We also got an appetizer (a cheese wonton thing?) it was good but you can pass and fill up on the noodles. \n\nThe service was good and though the restaurant itself is small it was decorated well. Sunday at lunch and it wasn't packed at all. I would go back again and I know they have takeout too!" u"I was super excited when I finally found a place that serves Thai style soup noodles! Then I went inside the restaurant and saw the menu... There were no noodles there. I thought I was being trolled by Yelp cause they indicated this was the place. Turns out there's 2 topaz side by side next to one another! One serves soup noodles and the other is a regular Thai restaurant! \n\nI ordered the guay tiew nam Tak. Without putting any of the spice and vinegar it's not good. But after altering the taste with it..it's not bad. Taste almost as good as my mother in law's (she's from Thailand) guay tiew! But for being the only Thai soup noodles..this place isn't bad. Service is fast so it's perfect for a quick lunch.\n\nI was upset with their Thai green tea..it wasn't as good as the one I had in Queens. Although in Thailand there's no such thing as Thai green tea.. Maybe I'll try their Thai tea next. The cup is super big and worth the price!" u"Not to be confused with the Topaz Bar & Restaurant; this is literally right next door! I recently came back from a trip to Thailand and had been craving the super cheap street or market noodle soups I've had there. I randomly suggested this place with a friend since it was close to our office and didn't have much of a expectation as I didn't think I was able to find the Thai street food noodles here but boy was I wrong! The only thing that wasn't like in Thailand was the price point (it was $1-$3 there) impossible for anyone to charge that in Manhattan so i don't blame them but the flavor and the noodle broth meat everything was AMAZING. \n\nI got the tom yum soup that had beef in it and the meat was cooked SO perfectly; tender and chewable and the cuts were delicious. The broth was so flavorful and had the nice sour and tangy sweet flavor typical of the tom yum dish. I really can't even describe it you have to go and try this place. I need to go back and work my way down their menu." u"Food- 5/5 I got the veggie drunken noodles spicy. The flavor was fairly full however I wouldn't say that it was particularly spicy. I had to add the little small container of spice to really enrich the flavor. Overall- would return\n\nService - 3/5 they weren't the nicest and they have this policy where they only accept debit or credit cards if your purchases are over $15 so make sure that you meet the cutoff or bring cash.\n\nThe restaurant was comfortable and clean.\n\nOverall - would return." u"It is a bit confusing because they have a noodle bar and another restaurant. They are not connected but locate right next to each other. So definitely make sure you don't go to the wrong place. \n\nI like the fact that they have combos so I don't have to spend too much time picking.\n\nYou can tell they invest a lot in the details. The napkins are such good quality and the seats are very comfortable. \n\nI think I will like this place more if they don't play Katy Perry and Taylor Swift and entire time I was there..." u"I don't eat in midtown often because I always find better choices downtown but Topaz is an exception! Unfortunately I found it too late and I'm moving out of this area but I'll definitely be back for this khao soi.\n\nTo be honest I didn't even really explore the menu that much because I came for one thing and one thing only - khao soi. \nA creamy curry soup with noodles bean sprouts chicken onion. So delicious! \nI've only had it one other time at Pig and Khao which is a smaller portion but delicious as well. \nI love the mix of thin noodles + crunchy fat noodles that you can keep crunchy or soak in the curry broth to make soft. \n\nIf you like Thai iced tea their glass is huuge and can be shared by 2. \n\nTopaz is a pretty small restaurant. We went at 8 on a Sunday and didn't wait too long but I can imagine it being crowded during busy hours." u'We went to the noodle bar around 6pm. Don\'t get confused because there\'s also Topaz restaurant! It is a small place but it was pretty chill when we went. It got really crowded later so I recommend you make a reservation before coming here. \n\nWe got Tom Yum dinner set that comes with salad and spring rolls ($16) and chicken Pad Thai ($13). \n\nSpring rolls were super crunchy as it were fried twice while because it cooled down the first time and the customers weren\'t interested. The salad (peanut sauce) was also sweet. The pad Thai was ALSO sweet. The Tom Yum soup was a bit sweeter than what I\'m used to. That seems to the theme here. \n\nThe tom Yum soup wasn\'t as spicy as I expected but I was glad to have gotten this instead of pad Thai. Pad Thai - too sweet though not greasy as how some other pad thais are but like eating a savory dessert. \nTom Yum on the other hand was delicious af. Get the tom Yum soup!!!!! Sweet sour savory spicy. The four holy "s"s. \n\nTldr: tom YUM GET THE SOUP 100% SO GOOD other stuffs are sweet.' u'On an unfortunate cold and rainy day visiting NYC I found myself soaked to the bone and in desperate need of warmth and sustenance. I found Topaz Noodle Bar on Yelp and made my way over. This side of the restaurant is smaller and seats only about 20 people. It was cozy and the staff were inviting. \n\nI ordered the dinner "set" that came with a small salad order of spring rolls and Tom Yum Noodle soup ($16 for everything). The salad was light and refreshing while the spring rolls were crunchy and delicious. But what I really came for on this cold and rainy day was the soup. The Tom Yum Noodle soup came out piping hot with tons of ground pork pork meatballs and lots of fine vermicelli noodles. My only complaint is that I wish the soup were a little spicier - I wanted to feel that kick. \n\nDefinitely a nice little spot off the beaten path serving up fresh fast Thai dishes.' u'Found this place after a morning of Central Park.  Beautiful decor and great atmosphere perfect for a glass of wine and some Thai.  We tried their pao tai and dancing chicken.  Taste was great but the chicken was a little dried and lacked of flavor.  Great customer service.  Overall not bad.' u"Intimate Thai restaurant with two sides - this one being the fancier noodle bar. We meant to go to the main restaurant next door but ended up here instead. Main spot offers greater variety of dishes whereas the noodle bar focuses on what you'd expect- noodle dishes. \n\nMy friend ordered the curry noodle soup special served with salad and two egg rolls ($16). I opted for the Tom Ka Gai coconut shrimp soup and vegetarian spring rolls. Albeit rich the soup was incredibly flavorful. Such a treat (and a bit of a diet splurge). For how rich it was the portion was perfect ($8). The spring rolls were very small and perhaps a little bit overpriced at $7 but they were a nice accompaniment to the soup. \n\nService was attentive and the location is great if you're on your way to Central Park (it's just two blocks away)." u"Honestly I chose to visit this place because of its rave reviews. But to our disappointment the food and the service here are so-so. However the portion sizes are large which is definitely a plus. \n\nWe came here on a Wednesday evening and there was only one waiter and a cashier so it took a while for us to place our orders.\n\nWe ordered the duck noodle soup the pineapple fried rice with shrimp the deep fried spring roll and the Thai iced tea without ice. The noodle soup came with chili powder on the side. The food was okay...we've had better. However their duck was really good...even better than the duck at our favorite Thai place. I really liked the Thai iced tea. The chili powder was okay too. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items on the menu.\n\nOverall...3ish stars because the service was kind of inattentive" u'Reasonable price and decent portions! I came here with my co workers and all ordered lunch specials we all left feeling full. This is good for groups.\n\n\nI had the flat noodles wonton and Thai ice tea. The Thai ice tea is good! \n\nIf you want chopsticks be sure to ask your server!' u"Really fantastic place. The food was delicious and rather authentic as far as Thai food in the city goes. They have a full restaurant next door that I want to try now and the noodle bar has a very large selection of food. Not only noodles. The atmosphere was very cozy and this could make a great date place. The music is soft and it's easy to talk. The service is great. The prices are unbelievable. \n\nTl;dr\nTry this place! Great food good vibe very fair prices" u"Ohh man this place is top notch. The service is great and fast and the food is delicious! You can great portion sizes for what you pay from the Thai iced tea all the way to the pad Thai. I seriously had an amazing experience here and I cannot wait to come back. I am very very picky with my pad Thai and they had great pad Thai. Their ribs were great and so were their spring rolls. I know they're known for their huge noodle soups but it was like 83 degrees outside. Trust me I'll be back especially for the noodle soups!!" u"Topaz!! Yessssssss yes yes... came here with the intent of walking to Central Park after housing some delicious noodle bowls did exactly as planned... this place is conveniently located a few blocks away from CP down a not as lively block and definitely in the cut... what I mean is ...you walk down a few stairs into this smaller room that is decorated so adorably and modern (like a cute little hide out lol) the staff are literally hustling the floor bc not even for 30 seconds did I see one empty seat... \n\nTo start: cream cheese and crab meat wontons and pork skewers... def a good jumpstart... the wontons were like perfect little pillows very rich and loved the sweet and sour sauce for dipping (5 per order) and the skewers I mean decent I've had better but still okay... \n\nThe Tom yum noodle soup was delish w a nice n spicy kick to it the chicken as requested in it was slightly over cooked but I got over it. Noodles are so thing but so delicious ... I loved it and would order it again... the lover had another soup with a darker sweeter tasting broth with beef noodles and I wanna say bok choi also very good... the chicken fried rice really brought it home for me.. I'm a huge rice lover and this rice was amazing nice sized vegetables and the tender chunks of chicken really a delicious win.. \n\nThis place is worth trying. I would also prob only come with one person as it is very tight and call ahead I guess if you're planning to sit with more..." u"I've only been here once but the food and service was good with a cute interior and easy reservations on OpenTable. Highlights were:\n\n- Geoy Hor Cheese (crab rangoons) were a good starter if you like crab rangoons that are super packed with filling. The outer wonton was cooked really well (crispy and light) but with all the stuffing it easily fell apart\n- Kanom Jeeb fried dumplings (you can also get them steamed) filled with mushroom minced chicken and shrimp were more like fried meatballs/very different from traditional fried dumplings\n- Gauy Tiew Ped Toon (duck noodle soup) was a deliciously savory starter consisting of a giant duck leg egg noodles bean sprouts Chinese broccoli and scallion\n- Gauy Tiew Pad Kee Mau was really spicy but tasty wok fried flat noodles with chicken egg basil leaves and bell peppers" u"I had a very nice dinner here on a Friday evening. We got there around 8 and were seated right away. The service was very efficient and friendly throughout the meal. The decorations and atmosphere of the place was very nice. It wasn't too dark but kind of moody and had cool artwork on the walls.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the veggie spring rolls. These were very fresh and had a nice amount of avocado. I liked the dipping sauce as well!\n\nFor an entree I went with the Phad Med Ma Moung Him Ma Phan (Sauteed cashew nut carrot bell pepper scallion baby corn water chestnut in chili garlic sauce) which was quite tasty. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and it had a nice array of veggies. The sauce was so flavorful too. \n\nI liked that the prices are very reasonable especially for a restaurant in midtown. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner if you're in the area." u'One of the good things about changing offices to Midtown is that it\'s given me the excuse to try out a number of restaurants in the area that I otherwise wouldn\'t have visited. Topaz Noodle Bar is one of these hidden gems and an offshoot of the popular Topaz Thai Restaurant located just a few steps away. It\'s a simple no-frills eatery that\'s popular among the Midtown office lunch crowd and is an ideal dinner spot especially when you need a last minute location.\n\nI came after work on a late summer evening knowing exactly what I would order: the Khao Soi. I\'m a little biased towards iterations of curry noodle soups and Topaz\'s version did not disappoint. The bowl was pretty generously portioned and featured a rich flavorful broth paired with a chewy medium-width noodle and slices of chicken. The bowl is topped with pickled red onions bean sprouts chili flakes and crispy egg noodles for additional tastes and textures which helps to round out each bite. I really enjoyed the thickness and spice that was present in the bowl which was tempered by the presence of the coconut milk and how it was rich without being overly heavy and greasy.\n\nWhile Topaz may not be the most "authentic" Thai restaurant you\'ll find it certainly will do the trick if you find yourself craving for a spicy curry soup or noodles and their reasonably priced menu is yet another plus. I would recommend taking a look at the menu before visiting and probably not on their own poorly formatted website so you won\'t spend too long trying to figure out what to order upon arrival - there\'s certainly a noodle dish to please any palate available.' u"I went around 2:30 and the restaurant was half full (small restaurant) and there were about 4 servers. \n- vegetable pad thai\n- crab meat & cream cheese wontons\n- pad kee mao with chicken (drunken noodle)\n\nCrab meat& cream cheese wontons were good. I wish the inside (crab & cheese) warm but the wontons itself were yummy and crispy.\nVegetable pad thai and pad kee mao were tasty but salty. It had me drinking water all day.\n\nThere were four servers but they were not very attentative. Waiter asked if we wanted chopsticks and we said yes but he never brought them. \nI may come back and give it another chance since its the only thai restaurant in the area\n\nMenu says 'everyday lunch special til 4' but its just during the week."],0.3291,0.107,0.893,0.0
90.Becco,[u"Pre-fix pasta meal was an awesome deal!  \n\nBecco is located along Restaurant Row in the Theatre District so once we were at the table our server asked us what time our show was which I appreciated because the staff is mindful of when people need to skedaddle.  Fortunately we weren't in any rush but the fact that our server asked made for a great first impression.  Any business that cares about pleasing their customers is an instant win for me. \n\nI wanted to take advantage of the pre-fixed pasta special that Becco has.  For $25 you get your choice of a starter and can have an unlimited amount of three different pastas which changes daily.  Especially given that it's Lidia Bastianich's restaurant this is a screaming deal. \n\nThe three pastas that night were a spinach gnocchi basil & tomato rigatoni and a goat cheese pappardelle ragu.  They were all delicious and had their own distinct flavors.  As soon as you tasted the pastas it was clear what flavors you were meant to taste such as the freshness of the basil and whole tomatoes in the rigatoni or the spinach in the gnocchi.  It was well prepared.  I also was especially pleased with the goat cheese pappardelle ragu because the goat cheese was abundant and made a huge difference in the overall flavor bringing out a light flavor in contrast to the bold braised pork ragu.  The braised pork ragu was awesome and felt lucky to have tasted this particular pasta since one of Bastianich's signature dishes is her braised pork over pasta!  The servers also frequently go around the room to offer more servings if they see your plate empty.  Plus you must take advantage of the $29 bottles of wine!  Whatever you're in the mood for they'll have a $29 bottle with your name on it. \n\nGlad to have finally visited one of Lidia's restaurants especially at an affordable price!" u"Becco is a perfectly fine place if you're seeing a play and want a restaurant that's basic and caters to a crowd on a schedule.  However I would not go out of my way to eat here. \n\nThe service was polite and efficient.  The ambiance is a bit 'generic Italian restaurant'- but no issues there.\n\nThe food itself unfortunately is Becco's weak point particularly their appetizers.  First the bread basket that they brought- it looked nice but the only tasty thing in it were the crispy seasoned bread sticks.  The regular bread in the basket that I tried was flavorless and overly soft.  For the appetizer the mini arancini was a disaster.  It consisted of three comically small arancini balls that were strangely flavorless.  If anything the rice inside tasted like boiled water if that's even possible- I'm not exaggerating.  Moving in a positive direction the pasta prix fixe meal that came with salad or antipasti and three types of pasta brought to you tableside was actually decent.  Again I wouldn't say go here if you want great al dente pasta- but it's okay if you're in the area and need an okay meal." u"My daughter's pick another Bastianich concept but was not my fav! The complimentary olives and assortment of breads and hummus dip were to me the only ones I like.\n\nThe parmesan chicken and the 3 different pasta were not my cup of tea. It did not work for me. My daughter loved her pasta dishes but my sister who joined us tonight and like me did not like her food either. Like my daughter she ordered the special 3 types of pasta special. And worst of all the bottle of Ros\xe9 was not good at all.\n\nI will be generous with a 3 and because my daughter really enjoyed her pasta she had two servings each of the 3 types wow! I will concede that the hand made pasta specials of the day were fresh but remained aloof for all that carb heavy pasta was not enough to tempt me. But really they let me down at the parmesan chicken. I'd rather had a boiled unseasoned chicken than take another bite of that awful taste like it came out of tv dinner chicken coated with God knows what- but absolutely did not taste anything like a Parmesan. Sorry...\n\noh by the way the receptionist yelled at us and was annoyed we had to ask for another table. The one she initially sat us was in a narrow path way and each time someone walks by i'm being asked to scoot my chair in over and my chest was literally on the table. I couldn't scoot anymore even if I wanted to. I tried to ignore her rudeness but after that bad serving of parmesan chicken Becco really left a bad taste in my mouth! Still to be fair my daughter liked her food and this was her pick so a lukewarm 3 for me." u"I had dinner at the bar. When I started the bar was very busy but then died down. By the end of my meal it was busy again. Cesar was the bartender and he was very charming. Extremely attentive approachable and friendly. Very interested in the patrons' experience. \n\nI started with the carpaccio - excellent. One of the best I've ever had. Very thinly sliced with grated parmesano reggiano and lemon. The lemon truly gave it another dimension. Ended with the buratta - a little bit much but still very good. Broccoli rabe was excellent but a little oily. \n\nWould most definitely return. All of the other items served around me looked phenomenal." u"Absolutely in my top 5 Italian restaurants in NYC! The food is all homemade quality is very high! I love the limitless pasta menu changes daily for the pasta - all very unique! This day it was pumpkin ravioli vegetable primavera and shrimp penne ala vodka. The burrata is TO DIE FOR but they only serve it as a special. My only feedback is that the waiter's service wasn't as attentive as it could be waited for water for quite some time." u'Really good authentic Italian food. The restaurant appears small but it has an outside section in the back two dining rooms and I saw stairs leading up (another dining room maybe?). \n\nOur waiter was very attentive and the food was delicious! I ordered the red snapper with garlic mashed potatoes. The garlic sauce was EVERYTHING. I wish I could have bottled it. My boyfriend ordered a special they had; three types of unlimited pasta (rigatoni tomato and basil and ravioli) with an appetizer (he got the Caesar salad). He had two Italian beers as well and the bill came to $75.' u"Met friends  here for lunch. I thought the food and the service was ok. Maybe it was what I ordered????? \nThe bread sticks hummus and olives they put out were excellent! \n\nMy friends had chicken Pallard and Chicken parmigiana. I ordered the polenta appetizer. I asked the waitress who really had no interest in being our waitress if it was big! She said yes!! It wasn't at all. Because I would have gotten another appetizer as my main course! \nI never really find fault with polenta. This one was pretty flavorless. It came with some kind of crispy bacon. I think it was more bacon then polenta. My friends enjoyed their meals! \n\nThe bus boy and bus girl were totally on the money! They were always attending to us. \n\nWe ordered a few desserts." u"This restaurant essentially exists because of the theater district you really shouldn't be eating here unless you're from the Midwest and all-you-can-eat pasta is your idea of fancy. \n\nI do have to say this place is pretty entertaining for all the wrong reasons.\n\n1. While waiting outside for a few minutes we witnessed two groups leaving the restaurant at the same time and they started screaming at each other on the street almost resulting in a physical fight.\n\n2. There were probably about a dozen deafening crashes of large metal trays being dropped by waited and another 2-3 glasses being shattered.\n\n3. The servers in charge of the pasta special seem to be incredibly unhappy they trudge over and act like your a huge burden on their night. \n\nThe only redeeming quality is that they have a large list of $29 bottles of wine in midtown NYC." u"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night waited 30 mins and was seated by 7pm. The tables by the bar area had very little room in between and the other areas including upstairs were more spacious. There are 3 bathrooms downstairs and 3 upstairs. Reservations is highly recommended. \n\nMy date ordered the unlimited 3 daily pasta and I had the Pollo al Limone. The pasta was not good. They all lacked ingredients flavor and sauce. It was very bland but the pasta itself was cooked nicely (al dente). My chicken dish was so disappointing. Chicken was rubbery and the spinach was very bland. The whole dish was sitting on this VERY sour lemon sauce. I'd recommend it you enjoy really sour food. I could not eat it at all. The only thing I actually ate was the bread and caesar salad. \n\nThe service here was a mess. Everyone had different jobs (bread guy waiter water guy pasta guy etc) and it just did not work together. I waited forever to see the menu after being seated. We got our water bread and olive oil way before the waiter showed up. After ordering I waited forever for the food. My date got his food way before mine. The 3 pasta liquids were mixing together and the waiters practically created a noodle soup! it was unpleasant to eat.\n\nOverall my experience did not meet my expectations. I walked out feeling like this was a tourist trap. For 2 people who ordered just entrees the bill was $70. That's upsetting considering the fact that it wasn't even good. The unlimited pasta for $25 is not worth it. Spend that money at a different restaurant for higher quality food. I would not return." u"This was probably my third or fourth time eating at Becco but the first time in a couple of years. I previously really enjoyed the pastas here but this time I had just an average experience here overall. \n\nWe came without a reservation and a party of 5 on a Sunday night. They were able to sit us within 10 minutes of arriving. The table was a little squished against a pole but no major complaints. That's about the best I can say about the service though since it was overall inattentive and forgettable. There was nothing necessarily wrong with the service but it was quite chaotic and more what you'd expect out of a dim sum joint and not Becco. \n\nWe ordered salmon pulled pork the fish special (which was a branding) and two different types of veal. Two of us also added the pasta sampler to our entree. I was a little disappointed with the pasta. It was ravioli rigatoni and a fettuccini today. The pastas were cooked past al dente. The food was good overall. I think the portions here are more generous than other places. \n\nOverall it's a pretty average place--decent but not fantastic!" u'Wow...what a great dining experience we had at Becco. I was on vacation in NYC and staying in the Times Square area right next to the theatre district. Becco was on my list of restaurants to try out being that I am a huge fan of Joe Bastianich. \n\nBecco is known for their signature homemade pasta dishes. We went with the pasta and the $29 wine bottle special. This consisted of all you eat pasta that offered three different types of pasta and a choice of Caesar salad or antipasto side. All for $24.95 per person. \n\nOur waiter was on point service was great and so was the food. Lively ambience since this restaurant is very popular with the pre-theatre dinner patrons. Charming little place. \n\nMy only disappointment was that I missed Joe Bastianich by a couple of hours. I was told he was sitting at the bar earlier having a drink and checking in on the theatre dinner rush. I was so bummed as my opportunity to finally meet this man in person slipped out of my hands by a marginal time factor!!' u"Okay yelp are you sure I didn't leave a review of this place??? \nI went here with my sister on a Saturday night it was busy of course But we were able to make a reservation with open table ahead of time. Unfortunately the night we made the reservation the pasta plates on rotation weren't my favorite. BUT that antipasto plate That antipasto plate!!! So many flavors I think my tongue went into a coma! Honestly by the time the pasta came by I was already so flavorfully satisfied (Which does not happen to this girl often). \nMy suggestions: check their facrbook/Instagram before you go to see the pasta types GET THE ANTIPASTO and make sure you wash it down with their reasonably priced bottles of wine!! \nP.s. I'm not gonna lie I felt like a queen having men constantly come with plates full of pasta to offer me more!" u"I can't believe I never rated Becco before!\n\nAMAZING food and tons of it for a shockingly low price. I recommend Becco a lot and will definitely go back again and again. It's conveniently located they take reservations on Open Table and they were even nice to us our first trip when we went there without reservations. Such amazing Italian food!" u"I arrived in NYC in the late evening with my friend. Staying in the theater district and tired from travel we opted to go to Becco as my friend has dined there several time in the past. First time for me and it did not disappoint frankly It might of been one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in awhile. We arrived with no reservation and were gladly seated in a beautiful area with a skylight. Our server Seth was excellent.\n\nI ordered a Cosmo while perusing the menu and munching on the incredible Bread Box w/an assortment of breads and White Bean Hummus and Olives . We shared a Beef Carpaccio. Entrees ordered were the Grilled Veal Chop w/garlic mashed potatoes shallots & asparagus which came with a Caesar Salad and Mussels w/a spicy red sauce garlic onions scallion rounds & fresh green beans & seasoned with savory breadcrumbs. The food was fantastic!\n\nGreat location for the theater district Atmosphere: very nice Service: excellent Food incredible!" u"Being so indecisive and hungry walking down restaurant row probably wasn't the best choice. Walked by Becco and saw how busy they were - figured I would give it a shot. \n\nSat at the bar where Julio served us (5 star service) and then I ordered the Osso Buco alla Becco $43 that had unbelievable flavor!!! The vibe of the place service and food made this an easy 5 star location.\n\nUntil next time..." u'Spectacular!!  This place is phenomenal.  Traditional Italian options with some modern flare on some dishes to add interesting options. The $29 wine list is really good - a great find in one of the most expensive cities on earth.' u"Hands down there is no better Quality Italian meal in midtown. The daily pasta special is always a crowd pleaser no matter what the dishes are. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're right at home. It's got the white tablecloths but you can go there dressed down in jeans and a sweatshirt. I will\nMiss this place most when I leave NY. This place is Home." u'Run by bunch of snobs. \nClearly worst exp. by far. Would not recommend it' u"Bistecca di Manzo Griglia is a must order! The steak is only cooked medium rare or rare and trust me you will not regret it. The sides as well as the fried onions compliment the dish really well and are equally delicious!\n\nYou will never leave this place hungry. They have daily specials where you can have unlimited servings of three types of pasta. I liked their spinach gnocchi!\n\nI did go with a group of 15 and had a pre-fixed menu but those two items were the highlights! Salmon wasn't bad either!" u"Very nice place. Food I thought was good. Got the unlimited pasta I thought was excellent. What's better than unlimited pasta for a pasta lover? Nothing at all lol that nights 3 specials were a goat cheese and beet ravioli which was good not great a linguine with clam sauce which was excellent and a farfalle in a seasoned tomato sauce which was excellent as well. Nice wine list here as well. Only downfalls were that they put us on the second floor in a small room next to a window with a view of many apartment windows. I was watching a lady prepare something in her kitchen as I was eating lol. Also the table was very wobbly to the point that drinks spilled on the table when it wobbled. Other than that I enjoyed it here and will be back for sure. I also like how they keep tabs on the time of your broadway show and speed things up so you don't miss it and get to your show in time"],0.4952,0.135,0.865,0.0
41.Barn Joo 35,[u"It was a great place to end the weekend!\nI went for dinner on Sunday with friends and the food ambiance and service were all great. \nOur waitress was very friendly and attentive. Everything she recommended was delicious too. \nWe had the soy garlic and the hot spicy wings both were juicy and crispy. They were out of the whole chicken so we're gonna have to come back to try it. NY Bites tuna mayo and tiger roll were also very good. The steak was tender and full of flavor and it came with yummy potatoes. Both the tuna mayo and the tiger roll seemed fresh. \nI wasn't expecting it to be that busy since it was a Sunday night but the service was still good. \nWaters were filled and plates were removed quickly without having to ask. \nFun music too! Will definitely come back!" u'We went here on a weeknight and waited about 10 minutes for a table because we had a large group. We were seated on the second floor and the atmosphere was ambient and not too loud. Definitely a great place for a date or catching up with a friend or two. \n\nThe tapa-like dishes were really unique and different from what you would find in Koreatown. Many of the combinations were common dishes with a nice twist. We decided to try a few appetizers and entrees and I think we all agreed that everything we tried was awesome. The portions were a little small but the presentation and tastes of the food makes up for that. \n\nOne thing that really stood out to me was the Calamari and Nuts appetizer. I usually don\'t really enjoy calamari but I couldn\'t stop eating their "wasabi buttermilk battered" calamari. A bit on the salty side but nonetheless really delicious. \n\nThe service was average. Our waiter was on his phone at times so we had to wave him down to get his attention. Despite that I\'m looking forward to come back and try the other dishes.' u"Five stars for the original fried chicken alone. \nGet this you won't regret it.\n\nMenu has many other offerings but I usually go back to the original Fried chicken it's that good. \n\nTip: Get a side of hot sauce for dipping" u"This is a very neat place and aesthetically pleasing.\nGot seated upstairs even though I already wanted to chop my feet off by the time I got there.\nThey have so many things on their menu that I didn't even know what it was but I ended up ordering an order of wings and of the calamari. \nBoth = DELICIOUS. \n5/5 Taste\n5/5 presentation\n5/5 sauces they come with\nProbably in my top 5 wings I've ever had. \nI would recommend!" u'Sister restaurant to the famous spin-the-wheel place in Union Square Barn Joo 35 unfortunately does not have the wheel but does offer a free soju shot once you check in. The restaurant is located a few blocks away from the hub-bub of Koreatown on a quieter street. \n\nMy friend\'s lychee tasted like watered-down cough syrup but I did like my gulp of midtown forsythia. We ordered the truffle fries and soy garlic wings to share. Although Bonchon\'s and Mad for Chicken\'s wings will always hold a special place in my heart Barn Joo\'s also had that distinctive sweet crunchy shell though it was kind of too greasy for me. Truffle fries have been done to death everywhere but I\'ll never say no to fries. \n\nAlso ordered the sashimi salad for myself just because my body needed greens. I really liked the sharp dressing they used and the fish chunks were plentiful. They also gave a small cup of chili paste dressing on the side. Overall I thought the salad was worth $16. \n\nTwo appetizers and three entrees came out to about $23 per person including tax and tip. Obviously the meal would have been a lot more expensive had we ordered dranks. \n\nIt was a slow Sunday lunch service with maybe four other tables but our waitress was really bubbly. When we put in an order of fries to share and my friend also ordered fries with her entree she declared "You can never have too many fries." A girl after my own heart. Then when someone at another table spilled her water glass with a hugely awkward clang she rushed over cleaned up the mess moved the customer to another table and came back with a stack of napkins in double time. \n\nNEXT TIME: Sashimi bibimbap spicy momil noodles sushi burrito' u'What a fun Korean Gastropub/Tapas!  Total score for Ambiance/Food/and Service - 4 stars all around.\n\nJust need to mention the service was super attentive -- not just my server but all of the staff from the check-in and throughout our entire meal.  Everyone pitched in and did a part in keeping the pace.  We were very pleased with our particular server as she made great suggestions based on what we asked.\n\nOne highlight for me - the variety of cocktails!  I thoroughly enjoyed my Midtown Forsythia so much that I had two.  My buddy ordered the Passion Rose Sangria which was also very good.  If we stayed longer I\'m sure we would\'ve downed a few more.\n\nThe full sized entree of the steamed clams were a great value.  Two dozen between the two of us; we were really indulging.  And filling up.  \n\nThere was one "special" appetizer - I believe it was called the Truffle Duck.  It was definitely cheese-y and the rice cakes looked like mini mushrooms.  It was satisfying and rich.  So creamy.  We also ordered the Korean Escargot - that was delicious.  Clarified butter - yum.  (We also tried the Nacho Belly - liked the flavors of the scallions and the sauce but the pork belly itself was a bit dry).  The best compliment to this dish was the tortilla chips.\n\nOverall a great value and a fun time.  The music was quite loud while expected it was a little hard to hear especially given we were sitting right across from one another.  I must return to try the Uni Bibimbap and the NY Bites.' u"Love this place. I come here quite often about once a week. The food is good especially their truffle fries and whole chicken. I highly recommend the whole chicken it is juicy and tender; not dry at all even the chicken breast isn't dry. It is freshly made so order early sometimes it's so popular they run out. \n\nThe staff is warm and welcoming. The hostess greets me at the entrance every time I come. Jae one of the bartenders give good recommendations whether it is drinks or something on the food menu. He is very attentive to putting in my orders and asking if I would like another drink. I come here for the bar frequently for the food and tremendous service I received at this restaurant." u"Great food slightly pricey for the amount you get and really nice ambience.\n\nI think it'd be a good place to go on a nice date.\n\nThe bulgogi stone bowl was just ok but the small plate we got - the fish cakes were SO GOOD.\n\nI also really enjoyed their dessert but it was kind of expensive for the amount - a big scoop of ice cream and four churro pieces ($12). Note: I'm not from Manhattan so this might not be considered expensive to locals?" u"It started out well - hostess was very friendly place was packed (mostly with Koreans too so this place must be pretty authentic) just a 5 minute wait and we were seated. Everything on the menu looked great - I think they had a professional photographer take pictures of everything.\n\nWe got the fried sushi roll (delicious!) escargot (which the waiter forgot about so they brought at the very end when we asked where it was - but they waived an item off our total charge for that :)) and the unagi (raw sea urchin) bowl. The sushi roll was great but the escargot and especially unagi bowl I really really didn't like - and worst of all it didn't agree with me and I started having really bad sharp pains in my stomach :( Could barely walk and had to take lots of medicines for my stomach after and stay curled up for hours :(\n\nSo this restaurant is probably good for some people but in my personal experience I didn't like the food and got a horrific stomachache :'(" u"Our last meal in NY and boy are we glad we stumbled in here.\n\nIf I was to ever open up a restaurant this place is how I'd want it to look taste and feel.  This was Korean fusion done right with authentic flavors but modernized with fresh and diverse ingredients.  The restaurant isn't too upscale but feels sophisticated and cozy at the same time.  A place you could pop in for lunch casual dinner with your partner or a group dinner with friends.\n\nI loved their presentation each person getting their own tray of banchan and the main entree.  I had the bulgogi dol sot bibimbap lunch special and hubby had the marinated raw shrimp bibimbap.\n\nTheir flavors were on point!  I loved my dish the addition of yulmu lettuce added a nice crunch and the bulgogi seasoning was perfect I didn't even need any gochujang.  Hubby's shrimp bibimbap was excellent as well with lots of micro green and the usual veggies.  \n\nWe were very satisfied with our meal and I hope to come back the next time I'm in NY.  Loved the interior too.  Just wish we could've tried more of their menu... Next time!" u'Great food great ambiance and affordable prices. What more can you ask for? Barn Joo was a nice little find when I was walking to a client site. I stopped in here with a friend later for a quick lunch and was very happy with my overall experience. I came in right when they opened at 12pm and the place already had a few people there. After another 15 minutes or so it really started getting packed. I recommend coming early if you want to sit down for lunch!\n\nFor food I got the hot stone pot with the BBQ chicken. We also ordered a side of steamed dumplings to share. The hot stone pot was a little smaller compared to a lot of other Korean restaurants but it makes up for that in taste and quality. The ingredients all tasted very fresh and the chicken was cooked to perfection. The dumplings were great as well. Nothing stand out but I would definitely get it again.\n\nOverall  I enjoyed my experience at Barn Joo very much. The staff are all very attentive and helpful. I will definitely be back sometime soon!' u"Came here for HH with a friend cause we thought we could squeeze in some food and alc for cheap but thang the bill came out and we both agreed not to come here again :/\n\nThe only thing we enjoyed were the fries! Wings were eh and the oysters for HH were super disappointing :/ didn't taste fresh to us. Maybe it was just that batch of the day.\n\nWe really wanted to find a spot for good HH oysters but after this experience we haven't gone out to find good oysters for cheap again." u"Came here on a Tuesday night around 6:30 with no reservation.\xa0\xa0They seated me and my friend right away even though we were still waiting on one person (hostess said they can seat us as long as majority of your party is here).\xa0\xa0We were seated on the ground level by the stairs.\xa0\xa0They also have a second floor seating area.\xa0\n\nThe ambiance was nice; however the tables were tiny and clustered.\xa0\xa0Although it did get pretty noisy in there real quick but you are still able to enjoy a conversation at your table.\xa0Service wise on the other hand was a bit....should I say..weird.\xa0\xa0The front hostess brought us to the table with our menus but a server never came to get our order until we flagged one down.\xa0\xa0He took down our appetizers but we were waiting for our friend for entrees however he took away all the menus.\xa0\xa0We ended up flagging a waiter down for a menu again and than flagging another waiter to finally order our entrees.\xa0\xa0However towards the end when we were about to finish..they were VERY attentive.\xa0\xa0The moment I was done with my bowl someone came to clear it out (literally) immediately.\xa0\xa0Same with both of my friends.\xa0\xa0We even commented that wow they are fast and must want us out of here!\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nFood we ordered:\n\nCalamari & Peanuts: Bleh. I personally didn't like the combination.\xa0\xa0Normally I am a huge fan of calamari but definitely can pass here.\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nTruffles Fries: YUM!! Loved the truffle flavor in these fries combined with the dipping sauce they gave.\xa0\xa0I could totally eat two orders by itself!\n\n\xa0\n\nKimchi pancake: The pancake was decent. Nothing special though.\xa0\xa0Standard korean kimchi pancake.\n\n\xa0\n\nBulgogi Hot Stone Bowl: It was very flavorful and meat was marinated well.\xa0\xa0I wasn't a big fan of the soup it came with but the hot stone bowl was good.\n\n\xa0\n\nTip: Bring cash.\xa0\xa0They accept credit cards but you can get 10% off your bill if you pay in cash." u'For a Korean gastropub the food is quite a delight. Overall experience was great I just think the bbq stuff is hard just because you cook it at table with a canned fire not gas or wood which I would have preferred but also might have been challenging. The fried fish fried tofu and fried calamari are delicious and a must try. I would say the ambience is great for a date.\n\nDefinitely would go back and try there other dishes with a focus on the tapas and less on bbq.' u"Came here with a friend at 6pm on Wednesday for happy hour only to be told that we just missed happy hour bc it ended at 6 :'( Nonetheless I had been flipping through the Barn Joo menu all day so we stuck around to order some drinks and snacks. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Lychee Soju a Fried Tiger Roll and the Crunchy Tofu to share - everything was delicious. They were also serving free soju cocktail shots which were pretty sweet. I really hope to come back to try some of the happy hour specials!!\n\nProtip (from our waiter who made sure to point this out to us as he served our drinks): If you want to get drunk really quickly eat the lychees at the bottom of the drink as they have soaked up a lot of liquor." u"Last dinner to my first trip in NY and I must say... it did not disappoint. Since my bf is Korean I really wanted to check out K town but on a Saturday night the small street is extremely busy and the place we checked out prior barely acknowledged us. Therefore we said screw it and found this little gem about a street or two away. Go here!!! The service here is a lot more welcoming and nice from initial walk-in into the restaurant to getting your bill.\n\nThis place is more of an americanized/modernized fusion spin on Korean food but it's very crafty and delicious. During our trip we got the Kimchi Pancake the Bulgogi Hot Stone Bowl and Seafood Kalguksu (the winning dish for sure). The Kimchi Pancake was so perfectly crispy & the kimchi and onions within the pancake were a little smoky in flavor which tasted great. The Bulgogi Hot Stone Bowl is in a hot stone that isn't nearly as big as the ones you find at traditional Korean restaurants - it's a little on the smaller size but it's super cute! Also this dish doesn't have all of the vegetables you'd find in a traditional one but I still really enjoyed it. The bulgogi was nicely sweet and the meat very tender and you're given the hot sauce on the side to add to your bowl too. Random but the seaweed they use in the dish is freakin' good and they also give you a side of Miso soup with the hot stone! Out of all the dishes the Seafood Kalguksu was the absolute best though. It's the perfect meal on a cold NY day as it's a thicker hot seafood soup filled with wheat flour noodles and an abundant amount of clams/mussels/shrimp/baby octopus. Seriously the amount of seafood within the pot seemed never ending and the noodles/broth... my goodness.. SO GOOD. I seriously loved it and I could sip on the broth forever if given the opportunity. This is a must-get!\n\nI also want to give Jin our server a nice shout out because she was incredibly nice/welcoming charming genuine and gave us really great service there. I always say it but I appreciate great service so much and it honestly can either make or break the experience and simply put she made our experience there even better than it already was. Thanks Jin! :)\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE: If you check in on Yelp you're able to get a free Soju Cocktail shot so don't you forget!!! \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this restaurant. Honestly it's a little on the pricier side of Korean food from what I'm used to but it was a nice end to my trip in NY." u"Loved this place. Was in the city with my girls but schedule was tight. So we managed to slip in for happy hour before dinner waiting for my girl to get off in the city.  Our plan was to just grab a drink and then head to dinner but ofc I would nvr be able to leave with just a drink especially when i came because of a frd's recommendation! \n\nI guess with didnt hit the busy hours so we got seated pretty quickly but it was filled fast and the crowd started to build up not long after we sat down. \n\nCocktails were cute. But definitely not strong. The food was really good. Tried the uni bibimbap cuz it was highly recommended for me. But i didnt find it extravagant. \n\nCouldnt try too many things as we still have a next spot to hit. But overall i loved it. Mayb cuz it was with my favourite girls lol" u"The restaurant is tasty but quite noisy. The two floors. Tasty dishes good service. Medium portions Average price. The wait is quite long we arrived at about 9:00 AM and entered after about an hour. They have a service that call you when it's your turn" u'Words can\'t describe the dissatisfaction I feel right now. \n\nI\'m really surprised given the amount of positive reviews. The restaurant was SO mediocre if not below average. Here is the breakdown\n\nFood:\nOverpriced small portions of food that you can tell is made insanely fast if not already prepared in advance. We ordered the scallion pancakes soy glazed chicken wings and two hot pots. We did the yelp check in - a "shot" of an alarmingly green cocktail in a plastic glass comparable to the size of a water bottle cap. Our entrees arrived before the appetizers. Our server had explained the entrees as entrees but apparently forgot to tell us that everything comes as it is ready. I love when restaurants call themselves "tapas" just so they don\'t have to coordinate the cooking of the food. The scallion pancakes arrived first. They scallion were $16 dollars costing more than the entrees. Unlike any other scallion pancake I\'ve had they were on the thicker side and over-loaded with vegetables. The vegetables were an unwelcomed addition. Not the thin crisp pancakes I had hoped for. The batter on the chicken wings was really thick and fried too much. Don\'t get me wrong I love fried chicken. Typically I say the more crunch the better. But it was wrong. Our hot pots were edible but not enjoyable. The beef one was low quality and the mushroom vegetable one was just a few mushrooms slippery tofu and a ton of rice. They came with a side of cold soup. Not intentionally cold just cold. \n\nService:\nOur waiter was nice but poor customer service over all. A bottle of water was put on the table but never poured. We told the waiter we did not enjoy the scallion pancakes (we barely touched them) and she laughed and said shed tell the chef. I hoped they would take it off the tab but no. The meal was a complete waste of money and I headed straight towards Los Tacos after.' u"This place is a good marriage between western flavors with Asian or Korean dishes. I'd say it's a little pricey but considering the neighborhood and audience I can't really complain. Now let's start with apps:\n1) Asparagus- covered in sesame and served with some sort of spicy mayo was as expected; crunchy and delicious.\n2) Pork belly nachos- pork belly was bomb tender and seasoned well. Paired well with the gochujang salsa deep fried tortilla chips and scallions.\n3) Pork belly tacos were nice but all I could first taste was the pork belly which was marinated in the traditional flavors or red pepper paste garlic soy sauce etc. There was just too much salsa and other flavors all fighting to be heard. It wasn't my favorite.\n4) Crunchy chicken bun - yum! Chicken was crunchy and simple and the fresh salad was refreshing! Loved the serano pepper and tomato garnish!\n5) Today's special - truffle rice cake and cheese was as expected: delicious with the fresh corn but the rice cake was too al dente. I wish it was much softer.\nFREE lychee soju shots for checking in were really good.\nThey have a texting app that shows how long your wait is and what number you are. Also texts you when your table is ready or you can text them back if you need a little note time. We were seated upstairs but later in the night they closed the upper floor so they asked if they could move us and gave us another complimentary asparagus plate for our trouble. \nThe manager later on also gifted us a free bottle of soju! With all these perks we definitely want to come back!"],0.5093,0.349,0.651,0.0
168.Cafe Un Deux Trois,[u"Finding my go-to place in midtown for breakfast and lunch has been difficult. Problem solved.\n\nThe food is great and the service is awesome. Busy enough to be fun but quiet enough to have a real conversation. The tables are not packed together - nice room to relax and never feel rushed.\n\nThe menu is creative but all the basics are there and I've been happy with the food all five times I've been there in the past two months.\n\nI don't know about dinner because I stay away from the whole pre-theater madness at places that are close to Broadway. But give it a try if that is your thing. I am sure the service will be great based on my experiences." u'Some great classic French dishes---but nothing that jumped out on the menu. \n\nMichael Moore was eating there at the same time his show is right next door. \n\nWine list is wonderful-we tried all the French ones of course. \n\nRestaurant is huge---it was more than half empty.' u"Dinner with Mom and sisters context here. We saw a show just down the street and we were looking to eat a better dinner than what we'd tried to grab earlier. Let's just say it was small and tasteful but you'll still be wanting more. \n\nObviously the French pride themselves on their cuisine. While the flavor was magnificent I recommend ordering a crepe if you have a small amount of hunger to satiate and an appetizer if you're just there for company. $19 for 3 pieces of smoked salmon chopped scallions and smooth sour cream just isn't justifiable for a meal although the flavor again was superb. The lobster bisque' approached over cooked and stiff. The escargot oozed a savory buttery version of shrimp scampi. The salmon crepe was light and a beautiful balance of ingredients with greens on the side. \n\nThe best dish by far was the chocolate mousse. You'll want to order 2 of these even if you're by yourself. \n\nIt was expensive for so little amount even though the taste impressed our palettes. It's really your choice depending on what you're looking for. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice though it gets noisy when people are drinking and chatting in the later evening. Our waiter was great especially when our real waitress ended up occupied with the others at the bar side of the restaurant. Food came out pretty quickly. Bathrooms are kitty-corner the entrance and down the stairs. You'll also see a picture of what I suppose are the 3 founders of the company which is kind of a cool discovery." u'ATMOSPHERE\nThis restaurant certainly seems like a super busy bistro. Its loud and busy. Be ready to talk a bit louder than usual. You don\'t have to yell.\n\nFOOD\nI had their coffee and dessert sampler for\xa0$9. It\'s a great deal! I had a cappuccino with a small chocolate mousse creme brulle macaroon and lady finger cookie. The cookie was great to dunk in the coffee. My favorite though was the creme brulle.\n\nSERVICE\nThe customer service was great. The girls are super sweet and friendly. Even though they\'re busy they were attentive.\xa0\n\nI would totally come here with friends on a "ladies who lunch" date before/after a Broadway show.' u"Perfect brunch spot to stop at in the broadway district before seeing a broadway show on a Sunday afternoon. Two of my good girlfriends and I RSVP ahead of time. \n\nIn case you don't make reservation I saw a handful of folks enjoying a delicious brunch at the bar. \n\nIf you are visiting in the winter months please take advantage of their complimentary coat check.\n\nGreat way to budget as well enjoy good quality food and service.\n\nWe took advantage of the pre fix brunch special which included a choice of alcoholic beverage main course meal and tea/coffee.\n\nI'd ordered a stiff mimosa and Egg Benedict without the ham I'd substituted spinach instead.\n\nMy meal was filling and very delicious! I should have taken it light on the mimosa cause I ordered another one which was an additional $13.\n\nEither way it's okay to spoil yourself once in a while. \n\nExcellent service! I would love to visit again and take advantage of their pre fix dinner meal." u'This is one of my favorite places in the city.  The atmosphere is great and timeless with an antique vibe of French music playing in the background. The drinks are superb and the creme br\xfbl\xe9e was very smooth.' u'Came for pre theatre dinner.  Waitstaff friendly and on point.  The decor is lovely. Plenty of people eating at the bar.  The escargot and chevre salad were very good.  The frites were perfect. The salmon was cooked well. Would have liked to see more vegetables on the plate. Would return when in the area.' u"Hungry after theater but don't want to go to a chain or fast food?\nWe went here earlier in the month (but I told my wife that I am sure that we also went in the late 70's as they have been at same place since 1977. pre-yelp)\n\nThis time we shared two crepes one savory one sweet ( hey it was 11 pm )\nCREPE CHEVRE EPINARD: Spinach goat cheese & wild mushrooms with side salad. excellent start; Ending with of course Cr\xeapes Suzette: Flamb\xe9ed with Grand Marnier and Cognac. ( but they didn't flame it in front of us but still very good)\n\nService good and they gave us the table right at the center window great for people watching!" u"The food was ok.  It was pretty small and overpriced but I understand because of the location.  The server was nice but didn't come back enough to check on us or refill our coffee when it wasn't even that busy.\n\nWhen we got our bill we realized that we got charged 18% of gratuity.  WTF?!  Don't get me wrong I do tip well since I worked in restaurant business for a long time.  It's just the fact they charged gratuity for a party of 2 pissed me off.  It ruined the whole dining experience." u'I am not familiar with the post theater dinner scene in NYC Times Square district. But I will say this. Unless you have no expectation or reservations try it.' u"Christmastime is the best time to go! Their decorations are perfect and it makes the place look so nice and cozy. I went here twice in two weeks during winter and got the Croque Madame the first time which was really good and my boyfriend got the Cr\xeape Benedict which he liked. The second time I can't really remember what food I got but we got mimosas and bloody Mary's which were pretty good and my boyfriend's sister got the pancakes before we saw a show. Sadly the Christmas decorations were all taken down when we took my boyfriend's sister here. The portions are kind of on the smaller side so if you're looking for a place that comes with a lot of food in your order this isn't the place. Overall it's a cute little caf\xe9 to come to especially before a show." u"Menus need to be replaced. This place is nice but having menus that look like they are from Applebee's really brings down the vibe. Maybe in a hard backed book? Besides that this place is wonderful and so is the food." u"Tourist spot that my bro and I just walked into  because we didn't plan a place to eat in advanced and we were starving!!! We missed the brunch menu by 2 minutes and they wouldn't budge. I didn't really enjoy my meal I just wanted fuel as I was hungry. Nice decor pricey staff was fine will probably not come back ...but they could be someone else cup of tea ." u'Great food and atmosphere! From their decorations to their service it was on point. Anytime i visit NYC this place is a must for brunch. Their pre fixe brunch menu is $22 and I always get their salmon and eggs. It is cooked perfectly all the time! \n\nGreat establishment in NYC.' u"If you're a French speaker you will appreciate the name of this place... Cafe one.. two... three!! How simple yet creative. Actually even if you don't speak French it's still pretty cool right? \n\nSo I was staying in Mid town close to Times Square & wanted something close by for brunch. This spot came up & I decided to give it a shot. Seemed French & authentic. \n\nWell these expectations were surpassed. Not only was the service excellent they had a big selection of French Brunch items. Crepes... breakfast sandwiches.. fresh cut house potatoes... ham... coffee drinks... you name it. I ordered the Croque sandwich with ham & melted cheese with a nutella crepe. My oh my was it so good & came out in a timely fashion. The coffee was freshly made & the bread was so crispy. Cheese melted in your mouth. \n\nThis is a good spot if you're close to Times Square & want to get a good brunch walking distance. The service will be good & you will be surprised with their authentic French flare." u"Want to know how and why a restaurant can survive 40 years in one of the most competitive foodie markets in the world? Visit Caf\xe9 Un Deux Trois and you'll understand.\n\nA great room combining the best of the coolest New York and Paris bistros. Consistently excellent service. An always-interesting ever-changing crowd of diners. A full bar. Great coffee (AND hot chocolate!). Reasonable prices especially for New York's Times Square/theater district area. \n\nAnd the food. Oh the food.\n\nBurgers? Sure. Mussels and frites (fries)? Of course. Country pat\xe9 with chicken liver duck pork cognac and pistachios? Yes please. And so much more. Amazing crab cakes with an equally amazing house-made tartare sauce. A Peking duck sandwich that will convert even the most unwavering duck non-fan. Salads made with deliciously fresh vegetables and inspired yet unobtrusive dressings. Oh and those frites? Some of the best my wife and I have had outside of Paris.\n\nA tip: Don't wait for before- or after-theater dinner. Go for breakfast lunch or brunch. Get a taste of the best of Paris in the middle of Manhattan. And wish Caf\xe9 Un Deux Trois a happy 40th birthday!" u'Service sucks... the server was not friendly and did not want to explain the menu... the person in our group picked this place because she said it had crepes in the yelp reviews but they did not have it... the crouque mouiser was made with old sliced bread that was stale... the slice of ham was so thin it was almost invisible... the soggy salad that came on the side was not even worth eating...' u"This hidden gem in the Theatre District hit my French craving perfectly! I ordered the Soupe \xe0 l'Oignon as an appetizer and Moules Frites as my main meal. Both were absolutely delicious! The soup was perfectly crusted with cheese and the soup was savory and tasty. The mussels were to die for and full of amazing flavors. The serving was huge but will make for some delicious leftovers.\nThe service was just fantastic and so accommodating to our requests. I made a last minute change to my order and it was no problem at all! The food came out fast but the service wasn't rushed. The ambiance of the whole place was so beautiful and romantic but at the same time fun and family friendly.\nThe whole experience was perfect and enjoyable we're so happy to have found this spot." u'Returned after two decades. A solid NYC French bistro with great service still very decent comfort food French-style and decent prices for NYC. Was taken to Hamilton today and took my friend here after matinee. We ordered steak and frites (very good) and beef bourgninon  (melt in your mouth superb). They were making a promotional video tonight. Good for them. Lafayette from Hamilton would like. If simple bistro good in a classic festive environment is up your NYC alley Allez vous.' u'My quick bite before the theater was wonderful - I irderes the crepe with shrimp jambalaya.  Alright the rice was good I did not expect it inside my crepe.  That was disappointing.  The value was good and the taste was good.  The crepe was excellent.\n\nAfter the play my friends and I went for dessert crepes.  We ordered the Crepe Suzette.  Sauce was good but it was very disappointing.  The crepe did not seem fresh.  I wish the crepe was made fresh and the sauce flamed in front of us.  So maybe it does not have enough alcohol to flame it.  Not that I wanted it with alcohol. The alcohol burns out anyway.   It was too saucy and layered in folds.  It tasted like a soupy crepe cake.\n\nThe baguettes are great! They are served warm.\n\nHopefully they improve in the crepe Suzette.  I want it freshly made crepes and less sauce.'],0.0772,0.157,0.843,0.0
192.Mamasita Bar & Grill,[u"We came for dinner our last night in the city. We were able to get in right away. \n\nUnlike in Ohio the salsa that was brought to the table was great. It had fresh chucks of veggies and a nice kick to it. \n\nOur meals were great but the highlight was meeting the owner. He came over and told us about owning the restaurant over the years and about his daughter. He also gave the girls words of wisdom about education. We really enjoyed his company. \n\nI tried a small mango margarita. It was amazing. It had pureed mango at the bottom. And the pina colada's that the kids got were really good." u'I have never eat Mexican food regularly before.  I started to try Mamasita because it is right next to my apartment.  Now I visit here regularly. \n\nIn short this place taught me to love Mexican food.' u"Definitely not what I want expected when I walked up to the place because there were such great reviews but after eating the food now I understand why! \n\nThe service was great we were seated immediately even though most bars and restaurants in this area had crazy waits on a Friday night. The menu is HUGE. There were almost too many options but everything comes with a ridiculous amount of food. The margaritas were pretty decent. I'm a little bit of a margarita snob and I could tell these were most likely made from a mix but they were still good and the amount of tequila in there did the trick!\nAll of my food was super flavorful and delicious but there was SO MUCH FOOD. I could have definitely shared this plate with another person. \n\nI would definitely come here again!" u"Came here on a Sunday night. It was empty. The lady (a worker) was outside distributing menus from the restaurant. I knew it was dead inside. \n\nMy friends and I each ordered regular margaritas and combination entree platter (beef burrito and chicken enchilada). It was really tasty! $15 margaritas! They have so many choices. The combination platter was $16. \n\nAs we waited we were given tortilla chips and salsa on the house. Salsa tasted really fresh and rich! So delicious! Our food and drinks were excellent! We were also given a tres leche dessert for free. It was on the house again. Hey who doesn't like free food? \n\nI was a bit upset that the waitress was a bit slow in taking our orders and misheard me when it was time to pay. I also got charged accidentally for the wrong amount (additional charges that I didn't sign for on the receipt) which made me contact them the next day. The gentleman on the phone straightened it out for me." u"Wow! Pleasantly surprised by this place after having another couple I know take us there for some drinks. \n\nTheir margarita selection is so on point. So many flavors to choose from like banana and pomegranate that anyone will find something that they will surely enjoy. You can get them frozen or on the rocks anywhere from 12oz to a colossal 60oz. \n\nThe staff was soooo incredibly friendly and attentive. They brought us a complimentary tres leches near the end that was amazing. We loved it so much that the either owner or manager offered to bring us another as well as a flan. The flan was also awesome. We didn't get any food but our friends say it's the best Mexican they've had in NYC so I'd love to come back and grab a meal there sometime soon! Based on our experience I'm sure it's all great!" u"My first time coming here I had a wonderful experience. So much so that I had to share this place with a friends. I wish I hadn't . The waitress Shelly needs more training on how to deal with customers . After she seats us we ask for a minute to look over the drink menu. A minute turns into 5 which turns into almost 10 and almost 10 turns into me having to go physically get up to get her. She spent most of that time at the bar talking and eating (at least someone was eating). When I drinks came nothing changed. So we decided that we no longer wanted to sit there and be ignored. Then when she gives us our bill for three drinks we're overcharged. So disappointed in the service or lack there of." u'Omg! I was just strolling through the area and stopped at this place after looking at the menu outside. All I wanted was chicken nachos and this happened to be the perfect place. It is very low key and what caught my attention was the 25 flavors of margarita. The bartender was lovely.' u"Came here for dinner with a large group of friends the other night thought it was just ok. The owner is extremely friendly and the service was great but I'm not sure the food is worth the price. \n\nThey're known for their frozen margaritas which were pretty good though pretty expensive (a flavored frozen will run you $18 minimum). The food was also pretty expensive and although portion sizes were large flavor missed the mark a little for me. Not sure I could justify spending as much as I did again." u'In town for a few days visiting from Seattle and this place was down the road from our Airbnb so we decided to check it out for dinner after reading reviews about great margaritas and authentic cuisine. This place did not disappoint! Huge margarita selection and great happy hour drinks. The owner was very friendly and nice to our son and even sent us out a comp desert. Would definitely suggest to friends in town!' u'Fantastic service & people.  Food is good.  \nGreat margaritas.  Best part of the place though is the friendly interaction with guests & willingness to please.  Plus my daughter LOVED the ice cream.  Definitely worth stopping in!' u'The restaurant is kind of small but it sure does draw in a crowd (the bar area gets absolutely cramped and tables fill in the entirety of the rest of the place).\n\nMy key takeaways:\n1. Their margaritas will get you LIT (even if you just get one of their happy hour 16oz margaritas-- if you\'re not a frequent tequila drinker). On the down side for me at least the drink is more alcohol than fruit (I was hoping to get a really fruity drink).\n2. The owners of the restaurant will occasionally check up on your table. Very sweet and gives a "family" touch.\n3. If you order guac the chips are endless. YES!!\n\nThe food here was kind of what I expected (though kind of pricy) but nothing super amazing-- pretty average.\n\nDefinitely a place to hit up for drinks though ;)' u'I honestly use Yelp for help deciding where i want to eat most of the time.  98% of the time its spot on.  This time was a complete disappointment.  First of all This is listed as $$ which is a fairly reasonably priced restaurant.  This place is exorbitantly overpriced.  I had 2 margaritas and the spicy enchiladas (which were not even a little spicy) and my bill was 60$ and the food was just ok.  The enchiladas were overstuffed with vegetables and had very little chicken at all in them.  I found it a bit odd to find so many veggies in an enchilada.  The entire menu looks severely overpriced I will not be going back.' u"Yeesh.  Nacho grande was peque\xf1o. Large guac was small as well. A single flauta fluttered out at the end of the meal sad and lonely.  And I'm pretty sure my sangria had battery acid in it. Run away.\n\nTo add more: the manager accosted one of our party on the way out. Not cool.\n\nOn a positive note they did replace my sangria with beer with no complaint." u"This place is pricey. I am used to paying low prices for authentic Mexican but this is a little pricey. However the food is really good portions are huge the drinks are super strong and the service is amazing. I don't mind paying a little extra. \n\nWe got the nachos Supreme... Just wanted some sort of snack and then added on the chicken enchiladas. We were stuffed after these two items. We also got a couple margaritas and then needed a nap. The drinks are delicious and strong. \n\nWill definitely get back here for happy hour. Drinks are all way cheaper but it doesn't look like there are any happy hour food specials..." u'This place is incredible. The shredded beef chimi and the grilled chicken enchilada were both A1. The salsa is really fresh the place is clean the owner is nice and the margaritas are perfect. Maximum recommendation' u'Had an amazing 23rd birthday dinner experience!! They hosted all 16 of us. The food was amazing and the margaritas knock your socks off. I would recommend to anyone. Thanks for an awesome birthday dinner!' u"Meh. \nService was ok \nThe bartender was not feeling me returning a syrupy mai tai. He came out and asked if we knew what a mai tai was. Well... it's not nasty and syrupy. The Koreans know how to throw it together why didn't this bartender? Anyways... \n\nFood was ok. Just ok. I had to cross this place off my list especially after all of the raving reviews. I'm going to continue to visit my favorite spot Gabrielas on the west side. Everything there is 100!\n\nThe margaritas here are very good. I got the pina colada and it was delicious! I would def come again for drinks (only)." u'I thought the food was fantastic and we got a deal because it was near the end of brunch.  We ate at the bar. Dinika(spelling) was our server/bartender.  She was fantastic and very attentive.  She told me it was a family establishment.  There were a few kind of rowdy guys at the bar that some might have been a little offended by but I liked them and enjoyed their banter.  I think at least one of them were part of the family.  I ate the steak and eggs brunch which was only $14.95 with a drink included.  Same for my wife and I got her drink too.  And we both had a Patrone when we arrived.  So needless to say it was a good time for me and my wife went shopping while I just watched soccer on TV and enjoyed my surroundings.  The food was pretty darn good.  I loved the experience.  Great place to eat and kill time.' u"We were seated immediately which was good. Chips and salsa good. Waitress took our order but didn't write anything down. Got our good and it was incorrect for all four of us and sent it back. Got the food back and it was mediocre for myself; others liked it. They brought us a small tres leches to make up for the food and the owner force fed a spoonful to my friend\n... Food was also overpriced but that was expected. Wouldn't return to this place for food. Drinks are good though" u'I was hungry for a meal and just happened to walk by this place. This place is smaller than your typical restaurant but what they lack in size they make up for in service and food. This place us the only place that I ever been to that has over 25 flavors or margaritas. I had a cherry margaritas and a skirt steak with rice. Also the staff was very accommodating. Between the service and the staff and location I am looking forward to coming back for another great meal.'],0.6249,0.194,0.806,0.0
178.Donburiya,[u"At 2am on a Saturday I am craving tonkotsu ramen with nowhere to go. Guess who's open? This little Japanese shop a 8 minute bike ride away. \n\nSo I go and get some to eat at home while watching the big sick. It's pretty good but the broth itself isn't as rich as I'm used to (not as rich as the pictures look). The charashi bowls looked delicious so perhaps I'll try that for next time. \n\nStill with no place I'd rather eat at on Saturday at 2am I'll still come back." u"This was actually my 4th time here at this restaurant. And I just keep coming back. I came here this time with a close friend of mine just to catch up. The atmosphere here is relaxed all the waiters/waitresses we're respectful and attentive.\n\nWe got to here at about 8pm on a Friday night and got seated right away. The restaurant was not overly packed at the time but most seats were filled. We had gotten a table but later decided to sit at the bar.\n\nThis restaurant have a long list of diverse japanese food to pick from the menu. The food here is on point also. We came here for drinks so we kept it simple and ordered just grilled mackerel and this grilled sting ray fin dish to eat with a large bottle of Japanese sou-chu (later realizing it's Soju). We stayed for more than 3 hours and did not feel like we were rushed in any way during this time. The waitress kept refilling out bucket of ice since most of it became water so that's a +1 in my book.\n\nThis place is great to bring friends to hangout until whenever. Your group can be any size and still not have the feeling of being rushing out!!  By the time we left most people still in the restaurant we're either friends hanging out or dates that still wont leave. Some are here strictly for dinner so yes they have also dinner food too! \n\nLove this place. This is going to be my regular spot from now on." u"Stumbled upon this gem in Midtown after a night run in Central Park. Affordable and delicious Japanese food.\n\nGot the Sukiyaki Donburi and Pork Katsu Curry which were both so good. Their menu is pretty big so there's something for everyone. I'll definitely be back next time to eat with some beer pitchers." u'SUKIYAKI UDON!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Omg. Their udon is SO chewy just like Tsurutontan (fave udon place). Love the flavor of the sukiyaki broth too. We got a bunch of appetizers as well and everything was tasty. Really liked the dessert -- yuzu mousse.' u'The low lit basement establishment had that cozy grotto feel. \n\nI was a little miffed that the hostess a large woman with a funky bob and mod dress sat me at the bar between two men.  I drank a big beer in tranquility.\n\nOn the way to the restroom - I realized - I was the only white person in the place.  Everyone was Japanese including the staff.\n\n$5 16oz Sapporo drafts felt generous.\nI started with a 24oz for $9.  I guess it makes more sense to drink the 16ozers.\n\nI ordered spicy beef w curry and rice on the specials menu. $12.  It was delicious with only one piece of fat. \n\nAs the place got full the crowd was young and fashionable - from businessmen to artsy but you felt like you were in Japan.\n\nA casual place with style and authenticity.\n\nThe large menu makes it hard to choose.\nLots of rice dishes ramen and small dishes including sashimi round out the affordable menu.' u"I've been to Donburiya a few times now and I have to say.. I appreciate that it is located in midtown--right around my office! In that area it's hard to find a ramen spot except for Terakawa ramen (which may make it difficult for some people to go due to distance and the long wait). I also like variety of seating Donburiya offers--high table low table or bar. I personally love sitting at the bar if I am alone but if I am dining with someone--I prefer the high table!\n\nFood: I've had two of their ramen before and I think the Tonkatsu one is better. I also like their lunch set deal (ramen + a side) but that's too much for me to consume. I also had their Oyako Don which I liked! They provide a huge portion of it as well (for me anyway) so I end up packing up the rest of it... which is basically half of what they gave me. I never had the Tonkatsu ramen by itself so I'm not sure how much it is but having it as a set--it is $14 and the Oyako Don comes with a side salad and miso soup for $9.50! So it is indeed a $4.50 difference but it just depends on how much you can eat and what you feel like that day. I really like the ramen broth it's flavorful and  heart warming (should be super good for winter!). They only give one piece of charsu and it's pretty fat so I guess... I kind of don't mind it but... I think two pieces would have been great.\n\nI definitely would come back here as I already have been back a couple of times already!\n\nNote: the seat at the end of the bar table is really cold--the AC blasts around there so be aware of that! And service isn't too bad but it's not exceptional or great either. It's... It is what it is." u"Food is average. Not something I would purposefully travel to get and nothing that really stands out. However if you work around this location the price for the quality and quantity of food is well worth it. \n\nI came here for lunch with several coworkers and the only thing I really like is that I get an option to choose 2 lunches on the menu side for the price of one. So if you can't make up your mind and want to try everything you could pick that option." u"had the yakisoba tonkatsu and donburiya\n\nEverything was pretty salty but good. the staff is so nice. The donburiya has brown rice that doesn't even taste like the usual gritty grainy brown rice but more like fluffy moist white rice. I think it was a partially cooked egg white on top of the chicken rice and helped calm us down fr the sodium high. Cute place and nice music!" u"A group of seven(including me) came for dinner. Staff said they wouldn't be able to seat all of us in one table and said to split 2 tables 3 in one and 4 in the other. But we decided to squish all seven in one table since one table seats 6 people. \n\nFood here tastes ok. I got the tan tan men. It was a bit spicy but ok for me. 2 of my friends got the tonkatsu ramen which allows one free ramen. When they both wanted to get their free ramen it took forever to get the staff's attention. When they came they one heard one and walked away without hearing my other friend order hers. It took awhile to get one free ramen. And still took forever to get staff's attention for other free ramen. \n\nNo wonder why reviews here say service is bad... and i got to agree! Not a place to come back to..." u"This was our first time at this location of Donburiya (had been to the one in Midtown East before it closed) and it was much bigger than we expected from the outside. There are lots of options on the menu not just donburi although the donburi is a great deal because it is well-priced and comes with miso soup on the side.\n\nI got the oyako don since that has been my favorite bowl since I was a kid. The portion was pretty large lots of rice chicken and egg. I thought it would have a little more flavor than it did so while it was good it didn't quite meet my expectations. I also tried some of the sukiyaki don which had much more flavor as well as lots of vegetables and that seemed more balanced and satisfying. We also got some Japanese potato salad another favorite of ours. The salad itself was good but in my opinion would have been better without all the sauces they drizzled on top (seemed like mayo and maybe katsu sauce).\n\nThere were a lot of things on the menu and the page of specials that we wanted to try but didn't have stomach space for so we're hoping to return soon to try more!" u"Donburiya where have you been all my life?\n\nLunch service here is prompt affordable and delicious. The classics of Japanese donburi I often crave (oyakodon gy\u016bdon and katsudon) are all done well here neither too salty or too sweet with plentiful portions served over a bed of fresh sticky Japanese-style rice. And in the lunch special they come with a healthy helping of miso soup salad and tea. \n\nI've never been here and not found a seat immediately on weekday afternoons. Not sure about late nights but during the day the restaurant always seems to have plenty of spots." u'Food is very good price is very good too. Service is quick on weeknights a bit slower on weekends.' u'I wanted to like it but unfortunately did not get to try the food because the service was so bad I walked out. First of all as I approached the door a guy was bringing up armfuls of rotten meat from the basement doors that opened to the sidewalk.  My gut said not to go in but I was meeting a business rep for lunch.\n\nThe woman came by to take our order she was very abrupt as we paused for like 3 seconds and said "we are very busy and I don\'t have time to wait for you!" and she started to walk away.  As soon as we ordered our food I was worried she was going to put the incorrect orders in because she didn\'t confirm anything pay attention to us and she stormed off to put the ticket up.  As she started walking away from the table I said "excuse me! can we order something to drink?"  To which she replied "excuse me miss don\'t yell!"  I told her I didn\'t exactly yell I just raised my voice to get her attention since she just stormed off in the middle of us continuing to order.  I was just trying to move on from the whole experience and went about trying to order a beer but I kid you not she looked at me and said "you\'re a bad person!"  \n\nDude I have never ever done this but I just walked out.  I was stunned by the way I was treated after asking basic questions and trying to get her attention in response to her inpatient and straight up nasty attitude.  I called later to speak with the manager and of course he/she was not there.\n\nNever again.  Rotten meat (at least it was being thrown out) piss poor service and oh they weren\'t busy at all - there were like 7 empty tables.' u"We came here after watching avenue Q nearby. The restaurant is very narrow but fit plenty of tables. After a cold day of walking and venturing around a hot bowl of noodles would be the perfect remedy. We ordered the chirashi which is sashimi over a bed of rice. The fish was not as fresh as I expected or was sitting on the hot bed of rice for a lot longer but still very tasty. \n\nWe shared a bowl of spicy noodle bowl. Spicy is no joke! They used a chilli oil which coats your buds in this fiery pepper taste but I did not mind because it was delicious. I really liked the mushrooms and the pork in the broth and there were a lot of noodles in the large bowl. \n\nThe ambiance is very casual and this would be a good date spot. It's not too quiet with the servers and cook speaking Japanese but it's nice to find a spot to chat with others with some good food.\n\nAfter dinner we went upstairs to check out the karaoke bar which is American style rather than Asian style where they are settled into their own rooms. It was a little cramped when we got up but it was funny laughing at some of the late night bad singing." u"My boyfriend and I planned to see a Miss Saigon on Broadway last Friday and decided to eat dinner somewhere near the venue (only a 4 minute walk!!). We went in around 6:30pm and there was no wait for the two of us and the staff were very nice and accommodating. We got the katsu don sukiyaki don the pancake some sake and beer.\n\nOverall a very good experience. The portions were big staff checked up on us constantly and the food was very good. There's a lot of options and variety on the menu that I was overwhelmed onto what to get- guess I'll have to come back to try the other options!" u'Authentic don and nice fried chicken. Next door to Yakitori Totto making it an easy alternative once getting rejected by the line in the former. It was also one of the top choices for a quick and tasty lunch with colleagues.' u"Just finished having takeout chicken katsu don in my room(Dream hotel).  While it wasn't on the menu I asked and they made it.  Place was moderately packed with Japanese clientele...and seemed like a very chill fun place to hang out.  Nice little gem.  Probably best if I ate it there...but hit the spot either way.\n\nService was fast.\nPlace was clean.\nFood was good.\nIt also seemed like a place someone would just bust out and do 80s-90s karaoke." u"The food here is good but the service is amazing. My water glass was never empty and they gave us complimentary tea after the meal.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. I ordered the katsudon (came with a miso soup) which was overall pretty good. The pork was a bit salty but the rice and egg/vegetables were well prepared. The portion size is also pretty big for the price you pay. \n\nWould recommend this place if you're looking for a cheaper dinner option in the area and craving Japanese food." u"Donburiya is a pretty sweet joint. It's very authentic and seems to have many Japanese patrons. Aside from the donburi there is a lot of variety in their menu especially with specials small plates and appetizers. Their karaage definitely stands out and the alcohol is relatively inexpensive. The wait staff is very nice but communicates better in Japanese." u"My two friends and I were looking for a bite to eat around 9pm. I've never been a fan of the restaurants around that area just because there's not too much variety. However this place is truly a hidden gem!\n\nWhen we came to this restaurant It was packed! It seemed so lively and the atmosphere was really great for a Tuesday night. There wasn't any space at the tables so we decided to sit at the bar. I ordered the salmon onigiri and my two friends ordered the rice porridge.\n\nThe orders came out really fast and they were presented in a very beautiful way. My onigiri was warm and really big too! There was enough filling that I didn't feel like I was only eating rice.\n\nAs for the rice porridge I DEFINITELY recommend it. It's so good and really leaves you feeling warm and cozy on a cold day. I would say it tastes pretty similar to congee but with a Japanese twist.\n\nI haven't tried the donburi but I will be sure to return. This place is great in service food and atmosphere!"],0.6588,0.354,0.646,0.0
84.Carve,[u"I purposely did not drink a coffee before boarding my early morning bus to New York City because I didn't want to have to pee every twenty minutes the entire ride. \n\nWhen I got off the bus almost five hours later I felt like I was going to die. Coffee is one hell of a drug. \n\nDunkin' is crap and Carve was the first legitimate coffee establishment that I found. \n\nThe employee was super nice the iced coffee was delicious and he took cards without a minimum. I'm pretty sure Carve saved my life that day." u'Definitely not bad at all I was parked right outside and went to go see a Broadway show me and my son came inside to get a piece of pizza it was very good\nThis was after 9 PM on a Sunday night they were a few people on it but it seemed busy outside they had all different types of pizzas available salads movies whatever you wanted\nWe just wanted something really quick to eat since we had just been sitting for 2 1/2 hours at a Broadway show so we grabbed a slice of pizza and made our way back home\nIt was towards the end of the night for the restaurant so it could have been a little bit more picked up they were napkins on the floor but the food was good but yes it is a little bit overpriced I think because of the location' u'Carve and its "pizza" sign are nothing but tourist bait in a neighborhood with much better pizza options. I was taken here by a friend in town who had eaten here the previous night and thought it was good pizza. It was not. \n\nThe first crime that Carve commits is the pricing. $2.95 for a single plain slice and double that for a specialty slice. $2 for water and your two slices come to $11. \n\nNext the pizza itself has problems. The dough was way too thin (I\'ve worked as a pizza maker as a high school / college job) so the whole slice simply flops when you pick it up. \n\nThird the pizza itself had pools of oil / grease most likely from the substandard cheese. This further worsened the bending pizza situation and wrapped the whole experience up in a bow. Avoid this place!!' u"We stopped here on a whim. Definitely not the best pizza I've ever had. The toppings were good but lacking sauce. Definitely needed more sauce. But I expected more coming from NY. This place is more of a deli spot  than a pizza spot although it advertises pizza on a big display sign. \nThis place is small virtually no seating to actually enjoy your food. The customer service appeared to be lacking especially at the register. Maybe it's the standoffish attitude of New Yorkers. Who knows? \nWould I come back? Probably nope! Pizza looks more appeasing that it tastes." u"Came here around midnight upon arriving in New York for my first time. I've heard nothing but good things about New York pizza. I wasn't try eat a lot since it was so late but I did try the Sicilian which was delicious but seemed pricey for a slice it was close to 5$ but it was still delicious I'm just not used to that price for slices in California but hey the quality was beyond my expectations. My other complaint is the inside seems crowded when it gets busy so if you want to eat here that can be an issue too. Also unless I'm blind there is no indication of breakfast hours and I was hoping to try one of the breakfast options but it wasn't available. Good place though to give a shot. I'll probably come back for a sandwich or breakfast before leaving." u'The Napoleon pastry had no creamy flavor; rather like a spoonful of sugar.  Two different types of brownies must have been several days old; hard and dry.' u"I liked this place and the people working there are real nice we didn't order much from here I just wanted something sweet we got the fruit tart and a plain cheesecake both were good we ate them inside by the window and just hung out for a few as so many people came in and out of this place we enjoyed just watching the crowds  they have a huge selection of pizza i was tempted to grab a slice but could not eat anymore and a salad bar with a lot of options. The location was next to our hotel which was the belvedere it was a great find good job yelp" u"I'm sure most New Yorkers would say this pizza isn't that great but I love it.  (If you are one of those people please tell me where you recommend!)  It's just good and in a prime location if you're in the area for a show.  Don't go during prime hours if you except to find a seat though" u"Another local business recommended this place. I walked in with and and said hello. The guy (a tall guy) looked at me and didn't reply. Then I ordered pizza and he was very rude . Not sure what his issue was. I just won't be going back. You're pizza is not all that for you to be rude to customers." u'Make-your-salad. Exactly what I needed. A range of vegetables cheese and some meats to choose from. Greens are not required (awesome). Pay by weight. Not to expensive.\nDinner.' u"I really enjoyed the white pizza. It's a very small shop and it shares with another but they're quick and the tables accommodate larger groups." u"I live in the area and talk about a tourist trap! The prices are ridiculous to start with and the pizza is lousy; $450 for a slice with pepperoni?? Even if the pizza was good ridiculous.\nI also take out a sandwich occasionally. No little piece of pickle no cole slaw. When I said i would pay extra for cole\n slaw and pickle I was told they don`t carry those items. A SANDWICH SHOP without pickles and cole slaw? Who eats a tuna sandwich without a piece of pickle and slaw??? In addition to all that the people behind the pizza counter are wise guys not nice.I'll walk across the street for better pizza and much better treatment!" u'After a long day and seeing Times Square we needed a quick bite. The selection of pizza was perfect and they had a wide variety of traditional as well as crazy toppings. The pieces are pricey about $5 each but they are gigantic! Delicious as well and fun atmosphere where you can stand and finish your slice or sit down and take a break. We did not try their sandwiches and salads or dessert but they had a wide selection of ingredients.' u"STAY AWAY AT ALL COST!! I gave a 1 star because I couldn't give zero!!!! By far the worst costumer service I've ever received in NYC!! (I've been living here for 3 years) I asked for a small salad at the salad bar. The server made a huge salad. I repeatedly told him I just wanted a small salad and that was too much. He literally laughed at me. Then the man at the register laughed when I asked him to remove half the salad l that I didn't want it. They should be ashamed of themselves. The f**king salad cost me $15:32. (Of course they charge by weight) And it was lunch time. I had  to get back to he office quickly so I bought it and left. I will NEVER go back!" u"Short and sweet: grab the blueberry muffin and a cup of joe - you'll be set for a quick morning snack \n\nThe detail orientated yelpers: My sister was the one to spot this gem out. I'd say I wasn't all for going in because I was about done with to-go coffee cups at this point in the trip. She wanted a large pastry that was simple and basic. She found herself a delicious blueberry muffin here and I ordered a black coffee. I'll say the coffee was convenient and the blueberry muffin was satisfying. I gave them a three because they had wonderful customer service extremely convenient and variety. My order was just the coffee but we returned each day of our trip for my sister to grab the blueberry muffin before our daily adventures. \n\nClosing words: If we're back in NYC around the area I'm sure we'll grab a blueberry muffin coffee and maybe a slice of the delicious looking pizza!" u'This place was just around the corner from my hotel so I was lucky to find it on a freezing day in March.  .   It was pretty busy for mid afternoon day before a snowstorm.   People were ordering all kinds of sandwiches etc.   I ordered a slice of pizza.  Unfortunately they did not have any regular cheese slices at the time so I ordered one with sausage/veggies.  It was good but way too big for me to eat it all .  I prefer a plain cheese pizza. They also sold fresh fruit and I brought some back to my hotel room.   This place does get very busy though and seating is limited.' u'Desperate for food and wife was not acting rationale.  We stopped for slices of pizza because it was packed with customers.  Turns out a school trip had stopped for lunch but never mind.  We sat down with our reheated slices and a few soft drinks and were shocked how good it was.   Great crust good toppings friendly service.  These places are a dime a dozen in Times Square but it was the right place at the right time for us on this day and it did not disappoint.' u"I actually liked the pizza even though it would be considered touristy food being in midtown. I love New York thin crust pizza & can eat it morning noon & night. The service wasn't bad and they had many offerings other than pizza. I took some things such as garlic rolls back to the hotel." u'Carve was close to our hotel so we gave this place a try because we wanted to try as much pizza as we could from as many places as we could before going home. Also I think it\'s a chain because we saw several places named "Carve" while walking down 8th street.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nA slice of Barbecue Chicken (bbq sauce on top with mozzarella).\nA chocolate cannoli.\n\nWe split the pizza right down the middle and it was just okay. There was a lot of bbq sauce on top and so much cheese and chicken that the whole thing was collapsing (need a fork and knife for this one!). The flavor was - chicken in bbq sauce with some mozzarella. The breading wasn\'t anything special either. I didn\'t eat the crust.\n\nI thought the cannoli was good - but I\'ve never had one before so I had nothing to judge it off of. However it was not too sweet and the filling was creamy and rich. I tried a few others afterwards and all of them tasted about the same.' u'It took approximately 15 min for me to receive my food. It was mediocre for the amount of time it took. I ordered a cheeseburger. It was soaked with grease and the tomatoes left much to be desired.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

( be sure to check in because there is a shot that comes your way!).\n\n\nThe shepherds pie was substantial and served up super quick. It was great with pepper and was ample.  Great Irish comfort food.  I wish it was shredded beef and a little more spicey but then again  it wouldn"t pass the authentic test if it was zippy!\n\nThe serving team hustles but attends to the diners well and with killer smiles.  \n\nThe interior is the best!  A great long bar with bar team ready at all points. The cieling bar tabkes and decor make the decor awesome.  \n\n\nA place worth stopping at again and again.' u"Good beer classic pub atmosphere. Not terribly crowded in the main seating but the bar was fairly full.\n\nThey had an offer for a free shot with purchase that I would've loved to cash in but I had to walk back to my hotel still. Opportunity lost." u'Was sat down promptly.  Waitress was kind and was on top of her game.  The tables were very nice and live music made the atmosphere really peaceful compared to out in the streets of Manhattan.\nFood was really good but very pricey.  Service good. Food good.  Live music.' u"An Irish pub in Portland had my favorite mushroom sauce and steak.  It was a mixture of wild mushrooms and enhanced the flavor of a ribeye steak that was already delicious from the char salt & pepper.  An Irish pub in Palm Springs had my favorite chicken pot pie.  Crust was crunchy and the flavor of the chicken and gravy put Marie Calendar's to shame.  \n\nI had high hopes when I spotted an Irish pub right next to the hotel I was staying at.  I thought it was a good sign the bar area was packed.  Service was good as the waitress was nice and our food came out quick.\n\nChicken pot pie had shredded chicken carrots and potatoes which were very tasty.  Not a fan of the flaky pastry top though.  It was gooey after the gravy got on it.  I prefer a crunchy crust like at Marie Calendars.\n\nWhile the pie wasn't bad it was expensive at $18.   I'm going keep trying Irish Pubs for that one chicken pot pie I can't get enough of." u"They did a great job of getting us out in time for the show the drinks were powerful and the food was tasty.  I guess my biggest complaint was that a side salad which really was a side salad size portion of greens and some of the other veggies was $11 per salad.  I actually think they made a mistake but we did have that show to catch.\n\nI had a pork chop with spinach and it was a nice piece of meat that may have benefitted from a little more seasoning but otherwise was very good.  The ribs were dressed in way too much BBQ sauce but were also tasty once some of the excess sauce was removed.  The rack of lamb was also very good.  Although we didn't order any we saw some of the Irish specialties go back and they looked vey inviting--the food not the servers." u'Enjoyed my shepards pie but my wifes corned beef sandwich. Awesome roasted and served fresh rye and Irish cut potatos fried chips.' u'There is a bar in the front area and tables for dining in the back area. Friendly service and the manager stopped by each table to make sure that everything was good. The group that I was with had favorable comments about their meals and the prices are reasonable. I would visit again if I was in the area.' u'It was a Friday night but the staff gave us plenty of time catering to us even though the place was very busy. Great service good food delicious cocktails.' u"Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with the amount of people in this area that I never really bother to discover the great places this area does have to offer. Friends decided to come to Langan's Pub one evening. I worked in the area for 3 years but never heard of it was not sure where it was but so glad I decided to come through with everyone one night. \n\nThe drinks are solid expect some great bar food too. The wings is where it's at. The bartender Kyle was great great service and spacious place for groups. I will definitely keep this place in mind if I am ever in the neighborhood." u"The good thing is this place doesn't seem to be full of tourists. They have bars at the front and proper dining area at the back. \n\nThe food is hit or miss. My Langan Burger is good. Medium rare with pink in the center. So thick and juicy and with big slice of pickle and onions it's almost impossible to get a clean bite with all the layers. I ended up eating with knife and fork half way. The fries are good wonderfully crispy. \n\nThe Chicken Curry is a disappointment. It is under Irish Traditional Entree in the menu which made me raised my perfectly shaped eyebrows. The curry tastes like curry powder mixed with water. The Chicken cuts are obviously not cooked with the curry because they are all dry and tasteless and fries with curry just tastes wrong.\n\nThe service is not as friendly. The lady who ushered us in and gave us the check doesn't smile at all. The tables are close to each other so you won't get much privacy to share earth shattering gossips amongst your dining companions.\n\nI won't purposely come here again but if you're hungry and want to escape the throngs of tourists this place can fill you up. If you know what to order." u"(2.5 stars) I used to be a big fan of Langan's as it was a great spot to grab a relatively quick sit-down meal before a show. After a few years though I think it has lost a bit of its edge. The food is still enjoyable just very average now and not worth the Times Square premium. Given the plethora of options around the area you may want to try getting a reservation somewhere else first. \n\nWhen I first tried their Mac and cheese it was infectious: rich creamy different and you just had to get the large. Now its still a staple and it's still rich but it's one-note and just above average. After the first few bites you pretty much get the picture. \n\nThe chicken curry had promise and it surely wasn't bad but it just felt sloppy. The dish seemed like each part was prepared separately and then just added together at the end as evidence by the rice and potatoes being served atop the chicken sauce and vegetables. For most dishes that would be fine but for a curry not so much. The pieces of chicken were too large and didn't have any inherent flavor from the curry. The peppers were watery and seemed like they were cooked and tossed in separately. I did though enjoy the sauce itself and wish there was more of it. The meal overall is hearty and filling just somewhat underwhelming." u'Nice entry welcomed with open arms.  The price is reasonable. $40 for four beers. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the wings were great.' u"Bummer foodies. Saw a lot of food but giving Langans a 1. Got our beers and after that our server disappeared! Seriously. I'm disappointed because it s a local pub and the ambience is pretty cool. Paying for a beer and would of dropped more $ if I could of." u'Will is the best bartender in NYC. He was an amazing entertainer and never seen such a good looking Irish guy.' u"Microwave... first the bread is hard as a rock. Then they under cooked the calamari and it was too tuff to chew. Then I ordered the special chopped steak (medium). It was well done because they super heated it in the microwave. Both mine and my wife's meal were cooked in the microwave. What we left behind on the plates was still steaming at the end of the meal because it had been cooked so long in the microwave. I know fresh food and you can not get this from something hot out of a pan. Don't waste your money on the over priced menu." u"Langan's is one of my go to lunch group spots. if you go early they can always seat you and they don't rush you..I like that. I always order the Grilled chicken wrap with fries and it's always fresh and warm. The fries used to be thin and fresh cut now they are servicing waffle fries either way they are good. \n\nI've also been for after work drinks the bartenders are quick and everyone is friendly. More importantly the place is clean." u"Great Irish pub and restaurant.  We stayed at the hotel across the street and had dinner here.  Good food  good selection of beer  wonderful hostess and wait staff. They are officially my second favorite Irish place after O'Sullivans in Carlsbad  California." u"My wife and I popped in while walking back to our hotel just needing to grab a bite and recharge from walking around the city all day. What we found was fantastic authentic Irish food and atmosphere. Pub style restaurants are typically our goto and Langan's didn't disappoint. The waitstaff was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations. The serving sizes are great I got the fish and chips and my wife got the chicken pot pie and we were both stuffed at the end of the meal. They could stand to have a few more varieties of beer on tap but I understand in a heavily touristy area you need to keep the standard domestics on hand. Would highly recommend." u"Amazing food! Took a little while for the waiter to bring over water. I didn't order another drink so everyone else had their drinks and I was still waiting for my water. We got the larger order of chicken wings which were really good! The wing size was big which I liked. We also go the potato skins which were also good. I got the steak panini in a wrap which was amazing. I changed some things and they accommodated me with no issues. My friend got the Reuben sandwich which she liked her husband got the Shepard's pie which he was ecstatic actually tasted like Shepard's pie. (He was telling us he was afraid to get it bc of last experiences at other pubs) and my husband got the corn beef sandwich which he said he liked.\n\nTake Note!! The prices on Yelp are not accurate. They raised their prices. Not dramatically.. maybe by $4 tops on different items." u"Some guy invited me to come here . A bartender from there went to the other place where I was at trying to steal Customers. He was a nice looking guy but had a bad attitude once I got to the bar! I was on the other side once I moved to the other side to support him he told me I was too drunk and told me to go home.  once again this is my Birthday weekend how ignorant was that! He is cute but damn he ruined his looks by telling me I was drunk. I was spending money and not acting up . I don't understand what the problem was?  What a asshole?  I had one drink at the bar . Two drinks at the other bar with something with something to eat. The other bartender was nice and polite.  The other one was a complete dickhead. There's too many places to go in New York to tell a dickhead that don't want to want to work . Your drunk ..."],-0.34,0.0,0.455,0.545
138.Yakitori Totto,[u"They serve really good yakitori dishes. Perfectly seasoned. \nIt was exciting to watch the yakitori in action over the bar seating area. \nChicken dango didn't meet the expectation though. They were missing flavor and chicken was somewhat dry. Customer service was okay level. \nI highly recommend the ice banana dessert. Perfect sweetness and gives you refreshing aftertaste." u"Kinda disappointed with all the hype and good reviews about this place. I thought the food was mediocre and pricey.\n\nThe good\n- no wait if you arrive at opening time there was a time forming inside when I left\n- lots of choices and lots of unique interesting choices like chicken tail or chicken heart for the adventurous eater\n\nThe bad\n- wasn't really impressive with some of the yakitori like the chicken skin- thought it was too oily" u"Preface: This review is solely about my most recent visit to Yakitori Totto and not about the establishment as a whole.\n\nAs you can see from Brian C's review below mine we grabbed dinner here on 10/28 and noticed the chicken in the green pepper and chicken order was undercooked but assumed it was fine. Fast forward to 10/31 and we're both actively dying in the bathroom with raging fevers. In short we essentially suffered through food poisoning + stomach flu for a whole week.\n\nI usually have really great things to say about this place but after my last experience I don't know if I'll ever come back. I honestly just want the past week of my life back." u"*i would give it a 4.5 because their service can be a little rude and they can rush you a bit. I just think they can do it in a better way.*\n\nLove this place. Best yakitori. It's for sure my go-to! \nThey are usually VERY busy so you have to go right when they open or make a reservation.\n\nPricy but you get what you pay for. It's delicious! So much flavor. My favorites are definitely the garlic shishito peppers mushrooms grilled miso rice takoyaki bacon wrapped asparagus and beef! \n\nGreat Japanese food as well. The tako wasa karaage and tuna avocado salad! Service is great too. They are on it!" u"This place was on my list for a very long time and after reading the mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. The wait on Saturday night 7pm was about 30 mins. They don't take reservations on the same day and only for dinner (5:30pm-7pm). Place was small. We were seated at the bar. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nYakitori\n- Shishito tsukune (pepper stuffed with meatball). veryyy good. One of the more memorable ones\n- Kalbi. The beef was kind of tough. Skip.\n- Chicken meatball. Delicious but not crazy about it\n- Asparagus bacon. Good but how do you go wrong with asparagus and bacon anyway\n- Chicken skin. I've had wayyy better ones in dt marks. Very bland\n\nTori dango. This was interesting. It's basically a mild flavored chicken meatball wrapped in sticky rice. I liked it. \n\nTuna & avocado salad. Delicious! It had chunks of avocado and raw tuna. Just upset that there were only few pieces of tuna. \n\nCroquette. This was really bad. But the one dish that looked like the right portion for its price was served half cold and it kind of reminds me of a giant fried meatloaf more so than a croquette. \n\nIce banana. I had this for dessert. The sago (tapioca) was a little undercooked and it came in a tiny bowl. *Picture for scale\n\nMy experience was okay. The staff was great and organized. The yakitoris were grilled fresh right in front of me. However. It shocked me how SMALL the portions were. Every time they served us another yakitori (all came separate times) I was shocked again. Like... is this really what I'm paying for?? The food taste fresh but not as flavorful. I agree with others on how this is a hit or miss. My bill was $65 for 2 people and I was left hungry. Don't waste your money here I'm sure there are plenty of other yakitori restaurants in the city." u"Friend and I had dinner Saturday last week. We haven't seen each other since then. We BOTH got severe food poisoning symptoms AND high fevers 2 days after so this restaurant is extremely likely to be the culprit. We think the chicken pepper dish was undercooked.  \n\nThis was the worst week I've ever had from a health perspective. Seriously if I were an elderly or immunocompromised man I might be dead. \n\nPlease cook all chicken products thoroughly and foodies please check to see if chicken products are cooked." u"My boyfriend wanted to go for his birthday so I knew it had to be good. We went during a weeknight and with a reservation were seated immediately. We sat by the Yakitori grill which is a bar style set up where you're seated with strangers. The restaurant is very small and intimate but beautifully decorated. \n\nWe ordered a few items from the yakitori menu to start - the chicken skin short rib shishito peppers and chicken thigh. They're cooked very simply on bamboo skewers with a light char and a light sauce.  We also ordered the Negi Tori Don which is grilled chicken over scallions & rice - it also come with a runny egg that I opted-out of. The entree wasn't visually appealing but was DELICIOUS! The chicken is cooked in a spicy sweet sauce that could make anything taste good. The Yakitori items weren't anything to rave about but I would go back for the Negi Tori Don." u'We tried a variety of grilled meets with beef tongue and premium beef as our favorites. The fried tofu was another dish that stood out and we concluded our meal with their green tea affogato which was amazing. The meats are well seasoned and tender but portions are rather small. Quality over quantity though amirite? The service was great and everything is quite pricey here but the experience was definitely worth it.' u"This place is literally one block from my apartment and it has been on my must-go list for years. But after getting intimidated by the 1h+ waiting several times I've lost my hope. Luckily today dream finally came true! Came in right at 5:30pm when it opened and got a table immediately with 7pm time limit for next round of costumers. We ordered a lot: seaweed salad chicken skin heart gizzard soft knee pork neck rice ball asparagus eggplant eel don and almond tofu as desert. Everything was perfect balance of charred outside and tenderness inside tho chicken skin pork neck and almond tofu were the best in my opinion. They also hanged a large bag of hi-chow candies for Halloween so we helped ourselves. Will try to come back next time if luckily get a seat again." u'This place went down hill through the years.  Every dish was extremely salty.  Chicken meatball no egg to dip not charred.\nCroquettes were dry. \nNoodles super salty. \nSeaweed salad super salty. \nFried chicken super salty. \nWill never come back.' u"Reservations for 4 dinner on a weekday. \nWe were seated immediately upon arrival and service throughout was prompt and good.\n\nWe ordered a. Lot. Of. Food. And some sake\n\nOverall not bad food quality efficient service. I'd recommend the dons and meats. (Orders of skin were tooooo oily!) also unfortunately we were seated right below air vents so the toasty food became cold very quickly and with yakitori..... that's never great especially if you're ingested innards and appetizers like eggplant with mochi in a sticky broth. \n\nI'd be trying out other yakitori places before returning because we weren't blown away." u"Higher quality yakitori than east village for sure. The only draw back was the price. \n\nFour of us arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night was told there was a 1 hour wait. We gave them our number and left to drinks received a text 45 min later saying our table was ready. Nice that we didn't have to stick around for the wait. \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers and skewers. Everything was very satisfying and delicious. Definitely a place to come for comfort and casual dining.\n\nFood and drink here is definitely on the pricey side. Probably it is because of the prime midtown location. It is hard to justify coming here regularly but once in a while is not going to break the bank." u"I had a good meal here. Arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night and I had to wait 30min to get a table... the whole time I was waiting I kept on smelling all those good smells coming out from the kitchen which makes me hungrier lol\n\nThe best dish I would recommend is the $10 beef skewer. Although you only get one it's so good that'll make it worth the money. The Toto soup tasted interested. It tasted like the soup packet from cup noodles in my first sip. However the more I had it the more I like it. It kinda grew on me haha. I wouldn't get the tofu salad with ginger lemon dressing again. It's too sour to my liking. It was not a cheap meal but I left very full and my tummy was happy too." u"Small cute spot with some delicious food at reasonable prices. I wasn't super hungry when I came here but I got:\n\nMizore Gake - The standout of the night. Ordered this somewhat on a whim and it turned out to be amazing. It's a big hunk of eggplant that has been fried making the skin very crispy and the flesh soft and delicious served in a broth of sorts with mushrooms and mochi. The broth was savory and delicious and mixed with the eggplant this dish was amazing. \n\nTsukune - Pretty good rendition (my dining companion was a fan) I'm just generally ambivalent towards meatballs. \n\nSeseri (neck) - This was pretty good nice and tender.\n\nBonchiri (tail) - This was very interesting looked like small round blobs and tasted very buttery / fatty (no idea if it is actually fatty or that's the texture) and delicious.\n\nYaki onigiri - This looked a lot like the tsukune so at first I wasn't sure what we had gotten. Pretty good nice crispy exterior with sauce but again I'm just generally ambivalent about rice.\n\nHonestly I feel like the yakitori here isn't that much different than the ones I had for much pricier at Torishin (excuse my unrefined palate). While people complain about the prices here I actually thought my meal was quite affordable (admittedly I wasn't very hungry so didn't order much) and they didn't really enforce the $20 per person minimum. They are quite busy so do make a reservation and don't expect to be allowed to linger for very long. Also get there earlier rather than later because by the time I went a bunch of the specials were out (i.e. knee bone). But all in all a good choice not only for yakitori but also other Japanese dishes." u"My BF and I waited around 20 minutes on a weeknight so not too bad. The dishes were kind of hit or miss but most were very tasty. I especially loved the short rib and the lamb chop was great. Didn't care for the cold octopus - the wasabi flavor was way too strong and I felt like it took away from the fish. Tempura zucchini was good as were the chicken thigh skewers and gyoza but overall we weren't too wowed. The short rib was definitely the standout. Decent service. 3.5 stars." u'I had never been to a restaurant and had nothing but good to say about my dining experience that is until I came here and was absolutely blown away.\n\nThe first time my mother and I came to Yakitori Toto it was very late at night having just left a runway show at NY Fashion Week we were slightly tired and very much hungry. As I perused my phone for a spot still open late at night I stumbled upon this little number. A quaint Japanese restaurant at the top of wooden stairs. We waited just about 40 minutes to get in and almost left to go elsewhere but the smell was too intense not to try it. \n\nThe dining selection at Yakitori is without a doubt ordinarily traditional but extraordinarily delicious in every way possible. It is quite rare for me to speak of a restaurant as being so incredibly enjoyable but Yakitori deserves nothing but the best. Their small plates offer a unique dining experience similar to the concept of tapas at a traditional Spanish restaurant; giving you a chance to savor a wide selection of their menu. So in order to help you the reader decide whether or not to pop in at YT I will give some insight about 2 of my most beloved dishes at my favorite restaurant in the world to date.\n\n1. Tori Dango\nBrought to you in a warm wooden steaming container these "delicious rice balls of pure gold" are irresistible. The first time we came here we ordered this guy about 4 times. They are perfectly seasoned to perfection and quite an interesting relationship is created between the chicken and rice and they are certainly worth the extra 15 min of prep time. \n\n2. Croquettes \nThese crispy little pups as my mom calls them are something I didn\'t expect to find in a Japanese restaurant. At first we were reluctant to try them but eventually came to the decision of trying them out... and then we ordered 2 more. Their piping hot interiors of beef pair so well with the sauce provided that you\'ll never want to eat another type of croquette in your life. I certainly recommend these to anyone that goes to YT. \n\nIn conclusion I\'d like to stay that Yakitori Totto has been a family favorite for about 2 or 3 years now and I go about 2-3 times a year due to the fact that everytime I find myself there I end up stuffing my face full of delicious food and spending way too much money hahaha. I frequent Yakitori for my birthday as it is an excellent little spot for intimate celebrations of 2-3 people due to the limited seating. So if you\'re in New York craving a good Japanese experience YT is the place to go.' u"Really not that impressed with this place. \nThe skewer prices are triple of that in St. Marks and the quality is not better.\nI usually love yakitori but everything I ordered was just subpar...even the bacon wrapped enoki!! The seasoning is very minimal and there is no dip. I kept putting the udon spice on the skewers!\nThe best thing on the menu is probably the crispy rice on a skewer.\nDoubt I'll be back since there are many other places that can satisfy my yakitori cravings." u"I have to rate it five star since I missed one subway station while thinking about it. At that time I was overwhelmed by the overall dinner from yakitori totto.\n\nWe went there at Thanksgiving time which means at least one hour wait. But it didn't disappoint at all. We loved how fresh all the ingredients were and how nicely grilled without any sign of overcook. This could be the spot for my favorite yakitori in town! \n\nWhat amazed me are things I order to fill us ocha zuke rice with green tea and almond tofu as dessert. I did not know ocha zuke could be this good and comforting. As with almond tofu it was devoured immediately. \n\nThis is a well-rounded restaurant not only has great grills but also delicious small plates. Come here early as seats could be taken quickly." u"Favorite was Age dashi tofu kalbi premium Japanese beef Shishito with chicken and both desserts (sesame Mochi ice cream was better than many other places; banana ice)\n\nSome other skewers weren't so amazing. Would love to try the rice bowls next time (skewers alone filled us up)" u'I can never seem to get a reservation for dinner but I have gone there for lunch two times. The prices are very reasonable for midtown. I highly recommend the Chicken Nanban and get it every time.'],0.4201,0.237,0.763,0.0
113.Friedman’s,[u'Probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Great for breakfast / brunch / lunch.  Haven\'t checked out dinner yet but I\'m sure there will be a time.\n\nGreat for omelets and sandwiches.  Last time out I got a Friedman\'s club which was insanely delicious with a side of sweet potato fries.\n\nThe cauliflower and brussels sprouts are equally delicious. \n\nThis is a great gluten free restaurant and labels all their food as such as well as little toothpicks with "Gluten Free" signing to ensure it is handled properly.  \n\nVery outgoing staff always gets us seated promptly and are attentive to our needs.  Will be back again and again!' u"Friedman's is great for coeliacs as all meals are / can be ordered gluten-free. But the services was highly disappointing. Wouldn't go back.\nThe wait for a table can be substantial but within 2 miles for the place you can join the queue online. We still had to wait another 20 min after our estimated time once we arrived there though making it a 50min wait in total.\nThe food itself was good and arrived very quickly (before our order of juices & tea) but my poached eggs and potato hash was unfortunately slightly cold. The tea was only delivered to our table after we specifically told the waitress that it had been sitting on the counter for close to 10 min meaning the water was also not hot enough for a proper tea any longer. After we finished our food (not the tea yet though) they cleared the table quickly & put down the check. It was very obvious that they wanted us to get out asap and gave multiple hints in that direction while we were finishing up our drinks." u"We arrived bright and early to get to this place!  It was a good thing we did because this place is populeerrrr.  Filled every seat and the service was speedy.  Our meals came out 5 minutes after ordering despite the chaos of people coming in and out.  The complimentary seltzer water tasted weird... flat and had a weird aftertaste.  Almost sour? IDK I don't recommend it... \n\nHowever the food was great! Poached eggs with smoked salmon hollandaise and some hash browns.  It was slightly saltier than I like for the smoked salmon but the hash browns were . Also a fresh side salad.  Solid breakfast to start the day." u'The first restaurant we tried in NY. What an amazing place for brunch! \n\nWe ordered the eggs Benedict and a fried egg avocado tortilla dish. They were both so packed with flavour ! Definitely one of the best brunch places out there' u"I've always had a solid meal here in the calm environment despite there being such a huge wait for this place sometimes.\n\nI enjoyed their lunch options more than brunch but I still ate my whole mushroom toast which was fresh and really featured the mushrooms. The buttermilk fried chicken is really good in sandwich and waffle form. That habanero honey tho.\n\nCome at an odd time and you won't have a long wait but prime time seems to be after 11:30 on the weekend with large crowds waiting outside to be seated when we left." u"I'd definitely come here again but it's a little more on the overhyped/overpriced side for me.\n\nCame here with a party of 6 at around 11am. This isn't a good place for groups because the seating arrangements are limited to four throughout the restaurant. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and they were accurate in that we waited just shy of 50 minutes. The place is loud and they seat you in both the friedman's side and the Brown's bagels side.\n\nFood: Ordered the Nova Benny ($18). Egg was almost perfectly poached a little tougher than what I would expect from a poached egg but at least the yolk was still raw. They give an ample amount of smoked salmon and the Potato Pancake that it was placed on top of was good however it could have been a little crispier on the outside. The side salad was great. Fresh and tart dressing to accompany the greens.\n\nThe chicken bacon swisswich that my boyfriend had was pretty damn enjoyable. I like that they flip the bread and grill the inside. The fries were good and crispy as well. I also had a bite of my friend's cheddar waffle and that ish was soft and cheesy. Not entirely sure why it's so much pricier than the other dishes but it can definitely be split. Ended up paying $23 for my meal including tax and tip which is standard Manhattan brunch price.\n\nService: Okay. I couldn't tell if the waiter was being condescending at times when he came over but the interaction was a bit awkward and I just kind of tucked myself away in the corner.\n\nLike I said I'd come back but with a smaller group and around 9am or something to avoid the wait." u'Got there at 11am. They put me by the window which I would not sit again because its basically if they put you infront of a closet with no legroom. I was basically stretching out my hamstrings just sitting.  They also have a single bathroom that is unisex so time your bathroom usage based on the line and who in the group needs to use the bathroom.\n\nMy server seemed to not be having the greatest day because she treated me cold. At the end she handed me my bill and just moved on no goodbye or thanks for coming haha. \n\nI got my food quick did not wait over 10 minutes.  Got the chicken chilaquiles which I loved. The flavors were bold bountiful and in every bite. The cold avocado and fresh veggies on the top countered the hot eggs and chicken.  The green sauce had some acidity to them but man it was great.\n\nWill go back and am excited to try something different.' u'Get their brunch bestsellers/most popular dishes! Beware long wait during its prime brunch hrs!\n\nI had the chance to try 2 of their most well-known for dishes: fried chicken & waffles and pastrami hash. Both earns 2 thumbs up. \n\nThe waffles were served with delicious habanero honey. The fried chicken was crunchy outside and tender inside. \n\nThe pastrami hash had 2 sunny side up eggs and slices of toast served with creatively delightful blueberry butter. The hash and pastrami cubes were best serve when you condiment it with some salt & pepper.\n\nAmbience: clean classic modern look. \n\nStaff: fast efficient friendly.' u'AmaZing brunch! I ordered the avo toast and a side of potato hash. My friend ordered the eggs any style. We really enjoyed our food! We def plan to come back! The blueberry pancakes someone else ordered looked amazing so that will be my next order. The best thing is that everyone is gluten free!!!!' u"4 stars only for FOOD!\nAs a waiter never have I felt so unwelcome by the service that we got here on Wednesday evening.  Not only the waitress was putting down the glasses with a thud but she was also pouring water so inaccurately spilling it everywhere. I ordered sweet potato fries but got regular fries instead.If not for one of the members of our group who was saying that everyone might have a bad day and our waitress is not an exception we decided to stay at this place. We still left her more than 20% tip. I left her a message on my check saying that I felt so unwelcome she saw it but did not even acknowledge. \nDear waitress \nI know sometimes we get customers we don't like to serve but it is better to ask your coworker to take over or make a face and serve with dignity. \nThank you!" u'Cute little place on 31st between 6th & 7th with great servers cozy atmosphere and good food with gluten-free option.  My Cappuccino was outstanding!' u"I love Friedman's. They can make everything gluten free. There is nothing super fancy about any of their dishes but the flavors are spot on. To start I had the spinach and artichoke dip. Watch out it's a little spicy. For my entree I ordered the vegetable quinoa bowl with salmon. It was very large and delicious. The group I went with also ordered the fried chicken and fish tacos. Everyone was extremely satisfied by their meals.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and the restaurant wasn't too loud. We actually sat in the bagel place connected to friedmans but it was still a nice dinner experience." u"Watermelon lemonade - refreshing. Tasted like there were cucumber in there too? \n\nOJ - YES!!!! Freshly squeezed and delicious. Order it! \n\nTomato soup - REALLY good! Special of the day. Homemade goodness. SO worth getting again. \n\nSplit pea soup - also REALLY good! A cup is enough though. \n\nHomemade potato chips - be ready for a chewy consistency but good flavor. \n\nVeggie sandwich - HUGE! Tasty. Almost too big? Can barely get your mouth around it all and with hummus on both ends your face will be a mess. But I'd say it's worth it. \n\nCappuccino - it's OK. Ask for sugar. \n\nTuna melt - good but given the strong onion certainly not a date food. The pieces are too small to pick out and while it adds to the overall 'experience' you'll be paying for it later. \n\nStaff was friendly and attentive. Our waitress came over from yesterday and remembered us. That alone deserves a star! Beatles albums were playing in the background which was fun. Owner was nice as well. Overall experience was better on the second day!" u"I'm in love with this place. This place had the best pastrami sandwich that I have every tasted. The meat was tender and thick. It had the best flavor. It was juicy and not overly salty. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to perfection and had a sweet and savory flavor.This was interesting and tasted very good. We also shared the pastrami hash which was so good! I came with toast and a side of blueberry butter and blueberry jam. \nI feel like everything they made was made with care and extra attention. \nI am so happy we decided to come here for brunch!" u"My co-worker and I came here on a Thursday morning to meet a client for breakfast. Unfortunately Friedman's does not take reservation so we were gambling that the wait was not long at all. Luckily once we arrived we only had to wait about 15 minutes until we were seated. The place was jam packed even for a Thursday morning. I recommend coming here with the expectation of waiting a bit.\n\nFriedman's offers your typical breakfast fares from yogurt oatmeal fruit eggs sandwiches etc. Since I was still recovering from a fever I opted for something light. I got the egg white omelette with market veggies and a side of chicken sausage. The egg white omelette was super delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh. What I loved the most was the side of chicken sausage. It had a hint of maple which made it extra tasty.\n\nThe service at Friedman's was also top notch. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a friendly smile and helped right away. Our waiter during the course of our meal checked in on us frequently and was very efficient with taking our order.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience at Friedman's very much. You can definitely catch me here again some time soon. I just wished they would take reservations for breakfast!" u"I was really disappointed with Friedman's. 'm the foodie in our group and I was asked to pick a spot. I'd never been here before but I really wanted a good reuben and being in New York with this places reviews I expected it.\n\nWhen we arrived they were switching from breakfast to lunch so we had a short wait. Not the end of the world at all. The place was jam packed and had a nice atmosphere and pretty decent service. \n\nI ordered the reuben and some Brussel sprouts. My co-workers ordered burgers. I'm glad they did because my reuben was terrible. The meat was so stringy you could bite through it. To the point I had to deconstruct the sandwich and eat it with my knife and fork. \n\nThe only saving grace was the brussel sprouts. Everyone had some of them and they went down really well! \n\nSo much choice in this neighborhood I'm not likely to revisit." u"Came here on a Saturday with some friends for brunch. The line was extremely long which we were prepared for however they told us the wait was an hour and we were not seated till over an hour and a half later. We kept asking the hostess about when our table would be ready and she was very rude in her responses at times just waving us off and walking away. It was frustrating and not the best way to start brunch. \n\nThe food did make up for the long wait a little bit but I've had better food at other brunch places in the area. I would definitely like to come back and give this place another shot though because I've heard great things about it." u"Definitely expect a wait during brunch time. It helps if you check the wait time on yelp and go ahead and put your name down on the waiting list when you're heading out. We waited about 30 minutes for a table of 2. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles. The waitress told me that this is their most popular menu item. I absolutely loved the cheddar waffle. It was nice and thick with a perfect hint of cheddar. I've definitely had better fried chicken though. The seasoning was just okay and the chicken was a bit over fried and dry. Next time I would probably just order the waffle as a side and skip the chicken. \n\nService is very friendly. The restaurant definitely gets packed." u"So I like ordering the skirt steak (delish!) from here after a long day of work. I quickly ordered on seamless for a pick up. Got here and realized I ordered from the wrong location (15 mins from me). Feeling flustered they said don't worry they'll put in an order for me on the spot and cancel the other order. Now this is customer service at it's finest! Kudos to the manager!" u'I was so excited to try Friedman\'s because the previous night we didn\'t have the best dinner and I thought I would be redeemed with breakfast after reading all the great reviews for Friedman\'s. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nI got the chicken and waffles with hot cocoa (thank you generous dollop of whipped cream) and my Mum got a single fried egg with the sweet potato fries. \n\nThe egg was fine and the sweet potato fries were fine - but they\'re not worthy of more than 2 stars in my opinion. The chicken was bland not succulent and generally pretty generic. The cheddar waffle was well made and it looked cheddary but it doesn\'t even warrant a happy face emoji. The honey habanero was delicious but not spicy (disclaimer: I\'m Indian not much that American restaurants label as "spicy" is actually genuinely spicy to me). \n\nAlso the coffee - just no. No. No. No. No. No. Way too strong and bitter. \n\nMy opinion may be skewed because I had AMAZING chicken and waffles in DC and nothing seems to compare. \n\nAh New York you\'ve let me down for 2/3 meals on this trip. Shame on me!'],-0.5255,0.0,0.371,0.629
136.Green Apple Gourmet Deli,[u"We were planning to eat at Ellen's Stardust Diner but saw the line wrapped around the building and decided we were too hungry to wait.  Kinda glad that happened!  We walked around a few minutes and found Green Apple.  We went in and looked around as they were busy but there was no line.  We chose a panini sandwich from behind the counter.  The Mexicano.  It took a little longer then expected to get it but they were busy and I think the guy just go overwhelmed.  That being said he was very friendly and apologized for the wait.  \nWe also got fruit from the salad/fruit bar.  Decent drink selection also.\nPrices were average and well worth it.  Check out was efficient and the ladies who rang up our order were both very friendly and made sure that we had everything that we needed.  We went upstairs to eat and it was small but had plenty of seating.  There were empty tables.  \nOur food was delicious.  The sandwich was a bit spicy for us but that was on us.  We read the description and saw that it would have some spice to it.  The fruit was fresh and juicy.\n\nMy only complaint would be the restroom.  There was only one and there was a line for it.  Apparently the employees have to use the same one because one employee was in there a while.  I went in right after her and there was no toilet paper.  Okay.  But then I went to wash my hands and there was no soap!  That concerned me a bit.  I pray that they have a sink downstairs to wash their hands at.  \n\nWe would certainly go back again.  It was a bit warm upstairs but they have seating out in Times Square too and we would like to sit there next time." u"Summary: decent place for a quick snack - kinda pricey \n\nAtmosphere: clean deli with seating and bathrooms upstairs. \n\nFood: they offer food / fruit / salad bars grab and go items including juices and kombucha and have made to order food at the deli counter. Limited organic options available as grab and go snacks. Made to order breakfast stops at 11am sharp \n\nPrice: can be pricey (salad/ fruit bar)\n\nStaff: friendly especially if you're a regular here" u"Great fresh juices with intense flavour and professional reliable service.\n\nI've taken off a star as all of the food options I've tried have been a miss.  However this location is still much better than the one on 37th." u'Awesome salads!!! I find myself coming back every time I am visiting in New York. The ingredients are always fresh.' u'This is a super busy lunch spot. I was attending a conference a few blocks away from Green Apple. When we broke for lunch this deli came very highly recommended from the conference staff.\n\nWhen I arrived there was a line out the door for custom salads. I did a quick walk around the deli to get the lay of the land. They had a sandwich area sushi asian food grill and the typical large salad bar in the middle. I decided to go with the custom salad bar as the long line assured me the food would be fresh.\n\nI got a salad with a small vegetable soup. The prices were pretty typical for the area around $13 for lunch - soup salad and a drink. I sat in the upstairs seating area which was reasonably clean. There was a nail salon housed in the same area so you did have some residual smell but nothing crazy noxious. \n\nThe food was good and tasted fresh. I would come back if I am ever back in the area.' u"Fresh & fast! Great variety of fresh food. Fresh fruit fresh squeezed OJ breakfast ready to go options or made to order good coffee selection salads and so much more. Service could have been better but it's a very busy place and knowing what you want helps move the line along. You can enjoy your meal upstairs in the small eating area. This is affordable fresh & quick satisfying food." u'Juices and smoothies are tasty. Convenient that they are open 24 hours. However -1 star for service. They charge extra for substituting ingredients in drinks however let you customize drinks with even less amount of toppings than in predetermined recipes for the same price... not much logic there.' u'This is really a great deli and since changing offices to a block away from here it has become my go-to place.  Their sandwiches are made to order and not pre-made in the morning which is nice.  The prices are actually slightly lower than the other delis around and the food is much better.  Also when you pre-order the food is actually there waiting for you - unlike a lot of other delis on Yelp where you get there and then they go look on some secret printer in the back for your order.' u'Green Apple is a staple for lunch in Midtown. It is conveniently located and the food is really good. Obviously like all NYC delis a little expensive for some of it. Definitely try the breakfast and the sandwiches. The salad deal is nice because you get soup with it as well! Food is always good and fresh! Note there is a $8 minimum for credit cards.' u"Excellent selection everything is fresh! There is something for everyone here - hot bar beautiful fruits & cold salads sandwiches made to order. This is the healthiest meal my family has eaten all week & everyone picked out their OWN FOOD! Still healthier than anything so far. My kids loved it - they're begging to go back again before we leave.  My husband loved it - nobody to tip - seating available upstairs. Enjoy" u"Really good gelato here!  My family and I were walking towards time square and saw the gelato and couldn't walk pst without getting some.  It's $6 for a cup and $7 for a cone 2 flavors.  It's a tad bit on the pricey side but it's definitely worthy it especially the berry flavor.  Salted caramel was okay but a bit too salty (just my opinion).  There were no prices or menu anywhere though and we had to ask the cashier which was kind of weird.  All in all good experience and great gelato." u"Green Apple Deli doesn't get enough credit among some of the  giant commercial chains found in Times Square. It is a small deli with some great sandwiches and very reasonable prices. The hours are open later than some of the other eateries in the area which is convenient for late night meals. They have a wide variety of foods such as a salad bar and Chinese. However they also offer subs and sandwiches made to order. We chose the latter option. The veggie burger was amazing as was the husbands Philly cheesesteak. After a long day of walking and sightseeing takeout from here was the way to go." u"With all of the deli/bodega options around I was pleasantly surprised by the buffet offerings.  Multiple types of salads pastas meats... you could even get full avocados.  WHAT?  I didn't but they were gorgeous.\n\nI wouldn't plan a huge meal here though.  Four stars because the advertised upstairs eating area is not glamorous.  I sat at a small table next to a nail salon so I enjoyed getting high off of acrylic along with my eggplant salad.  But for a grab-and-go place this was top notch.\n\nThanks Green Apple!" u'Nice place to eat something fresh and healthy in the middle of the city. You can taste the love in this food. I tried almost everything of the hot and cold bar and it was amazing !' u'Love this place! There are SO many options so there\'s something for everyone!:) \n\nI loved the food bar and everything looked so fresh and delicious! Super fresh fruit! Yummy ripe mangos blueberries strawberries blackberries pineapple etc! I also tried the salmon sweet potatoes RIBS! Everything was SO delicious!\n\nThere\'s also a salad station smoothies stir fry and sandwich station. AND gelato! Beer wine too lol. SO many options! \n\nAnd I loved all the little snacks they had like healthy nut bars kale chips etc. \n\nSuch a pleasant surprise from a "deli" with tons of healthy and fresh options which I loved! Not the typical boring deli with old not so yummy food which is what I usually expect from a deli:)\n\nCan\'t wait to go back! Definitely an awesome choice for lunch! There\'s also a seating area upstairs!! (Someone wrote in a review that there\'s no seating.. But that\'s incorrect hehe)\n\nFive stars!:)' u"Good selection on the food but they can't get the soup right. Their soup are sooooooo bad. I've tried almost all of their soup (bc it's free if u bought a salad) all soups are bad especially for soup that suppose to be creamy and thick like chowder bisque cream of broccoli...etc. they are all very watery." u"I went there twice in my 3 day stay! I'm a vegetarian but the other two friends with me are not. We all three got good options and variety for each of us!! The food tasted fresh and tasty! I took white rice and added different salads veggies  fresh fruits with it; they had sauteed veggies as well as a mix of some beans and avocado all of it combined was tasty..\n\nTheir price is around $9 per pound (although it seemed a bit pricy) and I ended up spending $14- $15 for my box which I filled a lot and it kept me full half of my day. They have fruit boxes for around $4. \n\nBut my other friend is not a fan of spices she suddenly got some spice inside the salad leaf which we were not expecting which made her uncomfortable.\n\nOverall I liked it and would go back again." u"Awesome variety to choose from.  It's a little overwhelming walking in but the guys behind the counter are great at walking you through your options and if you're lucky the customers will be equally as helpful." u"After having worked performed auditioned interviewed seen shows escorted tourists and putzed around in this area for the past decade I've become pretty versed in the deli and by-the-pound options available in the Theater District as well as in most Midtown West and East neighborhoods.  GAGD is leaps and bounds above the majority of their competitors in these - and most other - Manhattan neighborhoods I've frequented.\n\nVery clean store.  Very well lit (bright without being offensive).  Nice window display.  Large amount of seating upstairs (conveniently by a mani/pedi spa!).  Friendly staff.  Really reasonable pricing for sandwiches.  And a cold/hot bar that while priced slightly above the majority of their competitors is the freshest and tastiest I've ever found.  \n\nThey freshly restock it all day long and into evening rush hour.  And all but one thing I tried was awesome (as in I would have been happy ordering an entire entree of any of these dishes).  Everything was fresh flavored well perfectly seasoned not overly salted composed well and just delish.  No more dried hours old food to grab between jobs/appointments.  GAGD has you covered be it salads and vegetables a buffet of entrees sandwiches fresh salads parfaits and desserts!  They even have free WiFi (though I wasn't able to spy any power outlets....).\n\nDon't let the word 'Gourmet' scare you away.  You'll pay the exact same - if not less - here as nearly any other quick eats spot but you'll actually get your money's worth here!" u"The biggest plus about this place is its offering of a wide selection of foods. They have everything from gelato to Chinese takeout to Whole Foods style healthy stuff. All the food is weighed just like at Whole Foods and it's pretty expensive for the quantity you get. There's seating upstairs next to this hair salon place kinda ghetto. \n\nIt would have gotten a better rating from me but I had to cut down 2 stars because 1) the place is dirty (e.g. flies flying around) and 2) the rice I got was inedible (tasted like it had been sitting there for 2 days left to sour)\n\nThe rest of the veggies/meat/quinoa I got tasted fine though. And it's nice to find a self service spot in the middle of Times Square beside halal. Another plus it's open late at night."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
133.Fuji Hibachi,[u'What a pleasure to find a normal (I.e. not a tourist trap) restaurant in the Times Square vicinity. As much as locals like to avoid the area sometimes it\'s unavoidable because you\'re there for a show or you have relatives in town who are inexplicably staying in the area to be near the shows.\n\nAt any rate it\'s a solid little place with regular seating and seating at both the sushi bar and the hibachi "bar" (one long bar with two grills).  We decided to try both sushi and hibachi to get the full experience. Basic spicy salmon roll to start was delicious. We both went for hibachi steak--everything from steak to veg to fried rice (hibachi fried rice = best kind of rice) was very tasty. The chef was just the right amount of engaging (and endearingly--low key sang to himself some One Direction and to another diner made a "Numa Numa"/teriyaki pun which she definitely didn\'t get but I appreciated it). \n\n Prices were about average for hibachi (by average I mean we paid pretty much the same in Houston so not jacked up for NYC).  \n\nDefinitely would go back here next time I\'m in the hibachi mood and will keep it in my pocket for recommendations next time the dreaded "Do you know any good restaurants in Times Square" question comes up.' u"I've had my eye on this place for a while and I finally got to try it. It's pretty easy to pass by especially since it's on 42nd street. It's a little gem that everyone should go to. It's small but comfortable.\n\nThere is regular sitting the hibachi table with sitting and sushi bar. My family and I wanted hibachi so we sat there and it was breeze. I thought they wouldn't let us because we had a stroller but there were no complaints so I was so happy. I let my little guy stay strapped in his stroller and we sat down. The chairs are pretty tall so no issues there since hibachi is an open stove.\n\n\nWe came and did the lunch special. The prices are very good especially for the area. I was happy with the chicken and shrimps. The chef was very sweet  and engaging too. We asked him to make fire light up and he did it for us. That was cool.\n\nMy meal was so good. It wasn't greasy or overly seasoned. It was just right. It tasted borderline healthy and that's just what I needed. Portion was good too!\n\nThe entire staff was nice and it's something I always appreciate. I used the yelp coupon of $20 for $30 of food and again no issues. I was happy I got a good deal and food. I'll be coming back!" u'I took my girlfriend here for her birthday - I was a little worried at first when I read some reviews about organization of reservations as I needed the evening to go smoothly; It could not have gone any better! \nThe manager who handles the phone and the hostess stand was absolutely phenomenal. He was very personable and went out of his way to make sure that every customer had a good experience. \nMy girlfriend was late and since I got there early he thought I might have been stood up - rarely have I ever been to a NYC restaurant with such caring and empathetic service. When she got there she got the proverbial red carpet treatment as he walked her to the hibachi bar. When he learned it was her birthday he made the evening so memorable that we plan to make that her birthday dinner spot for now on (he had the entire restaurant sing Happy Birthday!) \n\nI very rarely write reviews unless my experience was remarkable; The staff made this an incredible memory when I expected an otherwise "standard" restaurant experience. This goes to show that you cannot judge a book by its cover....or a restaurant by its neighborhood or menu; It is about total experience and this restaurant and its staff offers that!' u"This gem is hidden in plain sight! It is right in Time Square and across the street from Port Authority. The waiter was super nice and the manager Eva came over to talk to us for a bit and was super welcoming. \n\nWe ordered the fried calamari appetizer and the rock shrimp appetizer. I preferred the calamari. The rock shrimp was good. We ordered one hibachi filet mignon and chicken combo with fried rice on the sauce. I liked the combo set and the sauce wasn't a fan of the sweet sauce but I liked the soy ginger. \n\nWe ordered an Iso Roll which was a soy wrapper roll with salmon tuna and a third fish plus avocado.Then we had a Demon Roll which was a shrimp tempura maki roll with spicy tuna on the top and a drizzle of a sweet soy glaze. Both were good but super filling. \n\nWe then ordered two sushi boats for two so basically for 4. It was only $62.95 per boat which I was really surprised at for NY prices. Also we only ordered two boats which meant we only should have gotten 4 soups (or salads) but our waiter knew that we were sharing the two boats among 5 adults and gave us an extra soup which was a nice gesture. \n\nI left full and pleased with the service and value of the meals. Definitely recommend this place!" u"I'm so glad that my sister dad & I decided to come here after going to the theatre. From the outside you're not sure what to expect but it's a cute restaurant once you're in & the decor is minimal but modern. We came 10 minutes after their lunch menu finished but we just ordered their dinner entrees which is not that much more than the lunch specials. I ordered the hibachi chicken entr\xe9e & my sister & dad ordered the chicken & steak hibachi entr\xe9e. Our chef was really funny & interactive. He didn't do all those tricks I've seen in the past but I honestly did not mind at all because I was starving and I just wanted to eat. \n\nMy hibachi chicken was cooked well but lacked some salt but the soy sauce helped with that. The rice was really good & the veggies were grilled to perfection. They gave like a sweet sauce as well as a ginger sauce & that sweet was everythinggg with my meal! Our entr\xe9e also came with a shrimp appetizer & soup or salad. My family & I don't eat seafood so we asked to skip the shrimp appetizer & they gave us the soup & salad. So nice & accommodating of them. The soup was a mushroom soup & it was yummy the salad was also good with the ginger dressing. It was a lot food & I was stuffed by the end of the meal. I mentioned we were out for my dad's birthday when we were having conversation with one of the server and they bought out an ice cream sundae for him. So sweet of them! & the ice cream was good the server said they make it themselves so I would try it if it's available on the menu. \n\nAs for the service of course it was awesome. It was only the three of us in there and they attended to us throughout our time here. They also make you feel so comfortable here. Loved it here definitely will come back when I'm the area." u'So amazing  I love hibachi and sushi so this is the perfect place before Broadway  or something casual the sushi was very traditional and the chef was pleasant  I definitely will invite my friends or celebrate a birthday here the hibachi bar seat a great group of people  this is the perfect place to chill with friends  dates and anniversaries. Cheers' u"Outstanding! We were the only people in here Monday evening around 6pm so we had the whole place to ourselves. The food was great and everyone was super friendly! Do know however that soda is purchased by the glass so don't guzzle it down and expect refills. There's no mention of this on the menu. They also don't have their permit for alcohol yet so don't expect that if you go as of November 13 2018. Don't let that deter you.. this place was so good!" u"It's kind of crazy that I'd give this place such high marks (it's really more of a 4.5 than a full-blown 5) but there's some method to my madness - even if it's a Chinese-run Japanese steakhouse.\n\nFirst off the one thing you'll take away from this place is that it's probably one of the best bangs for your buck in the city.  Granted it's not like the food here is cheap but the price to value ratio is extremely high due to the ridiculously generous portions that they serve here compared to other hibachi restaurants.  Case in point - I ordered the samurai steak since I figured I was hungry and could handle a 12 oz vs their standard 8 oz portion.  The amount of meat they used was insane.  It felt like I was eating two pretty substantial steaks at the same time and the chef had to scoop three times to get all the meat on my plate.  That's how much food you're going to get here.  Same goes for the shrimp hibachi which was a huge serving of large (and rather fresh) shrimps.  It's almost insane how much food they serve here.  \n\nNow portion is one thing but how does it taste?  Fortunately the food itself here was rather tasty.  Of course it's also greasy since it's a hibachi but the flavor of the food was great and the steak was surprisingly decent.  Same goes for the shrimp which was very fresh and both paired extremely well with their sauce offerings which is a bit on the sweeter side but still good.  The food also was scorching hot but that's a given when it's served directly on your plate.  There are seating areas that are not part of the hibachi itself but I don't recommend getting your food there as it simply won't be the same experience.  Everything else - including the fried rice and veggies were also solid.  Even the side salad was fairly substantial very fresh and the dressing was pretty tasty.\n\nThe chefs were entertaining and fun.  They do their best to live up to the stereotypical image of jovial hibachi chefs that was popularized by Benihana decades ago.  They also do the standard tricks like flipping knives set the place on fire with oil and onion volcanoes and prepare your food pretty quickly.  \n\nThe thing is this place is also pretty small.  The hibachi table sits like 12-14 peeps so there isn't a ton of room for the show.  There's a small sushi bar and also a bunch of tables but if you're going for the hibachi it really doesn't make sense to sit elsewhere.  However the service here is good and people are very friendly with customers.  \n\nUltimately what makes this place good is the insane amount of value due to the huge portions that they serve.  Luckily the food was solid enough to merit many return visits in the future.  Hopefully this place will stick around long enough since there aren't a lot of hibachi joints in Manhattan and it's always nice to find a place where you feel like you walk out feeling full and satisfied." u'Best bento box I ever had !\nThey were super generous as well for living in the neighborhood and being a first time customer' u"Has been here twice and everything was good.\nI like to see the process of preparing food so sitting by hibachi table is perfect for me.\nFood was delicious and portions are big.\nSteak and salmon are soft juicy and yummy. \nThis place is very tiny and they have just 1 hibachi table so it's better to make a reservation and not to be late." u'Happened to walk by this spot and decided to check it out since I loooooove me some good hibachi and there are definitely slim pickings in NYC.  \n\nThe service was attentive swift and prompt.  Chef did an excellent job of cooking our steak medium in general the fried rice vegetables chicken shrimp were flavored very well.   \n\nThe only reason I can\'t give more than a 3 star rating is because of the "yum yum" (yellow sauce) - if you\'re a hibachi lover you know that this can either break/make the meal!! It was way too sweet and could only use a little bit of it to accompany the sides.  \n\nIf they tweak their yum yum sauce I would definitely be down to come back.  \n\nAlso check in via yelp to get 15% off!' u"If it wasn't for an absence of a vestibule at the front door during the winter time I would have given this place more star. The place is arguably small the hibachi bar can only accommodate a dozen of people. While they were offering the front tables it's the most inconvenient area to find yourself seated. I even asked the manager whether he'd  thought of putting a vestibule or curtain in front of door since it's winter (yes I reminded him of the season) he responded that they'd just opened three months ago.\n\nSince they do not have the liquor license yet I inquired if we can bring our bottle the waiter said no BYOB but the menu says otherwise although my Lobster and Shrimp Hibachi was worth waiting for. I advice you to bring your business elsewhere unless you want to freeze your ass off while dining. I hope that the management will look into this and ensure the comfort of their paying customers." u'Made a dinner reservation for my daughters 14th Birthday celebration. Upon arrival no availability and we are asked d to wait for 15 minutes at a spare table\nAfter realizing this will take much longer than 15 min with most patrons at Hibachi without food we left. Would have appreciated honesty about availability for a Birthday dinner Looks like a cute but tight place. Can not rate the food' u"Flight was delayed and original dinner reservation was ruined. Looked up on Yelp and decided to give Fuji Hibachi a try as it is the closest to my hotel.\n\nHave been to some of the finest Japanese restaurant around the world I was not expecting much and just wanna get some food and ready for next meeting.\n\nWe ordered the Lover Boat which consists with assortment of sashimi sushi and rolls. It is late and we didn't want any Hibachi. \n\nThe sashimi was very fresh and the sushi were well made so I was surprised that you could get this quality of food at this price. It is well worth it.\n\nBtw I normally only write reviews for really good or really bad places. Fuji Hibachi definitely worth a visit if you happened to be in this area!" u'Great food!!! Very small and clean hole in the wall with great service. Highly recommend finding this place when you are in NY. \nThe steak and chicken from hibachi grill is very tasty and cooked to perfection!!' u'Ordered a Hibachi for delivery. The food was on the saltier side and it was very oily. For the price I would go elsewhere. They are very slow with delivery. Portion is much smaller when ordering takeout. Not worth the money.' u"Great VALUE Hibachi! The price of the combo is decent. Tried filet mignonette and lobster both were awesome. And the cooking or performance was pretty fancy especially if you are new to Hibachi. It was a potty I forgot to take picture just couldn't wait. They also have a nice sushi bar with seafood. Sashimi and Oysters were also excellent (actually had those before Habachi). BTW this place is very close to port authority. Inside was kinda nice though outside looked just normal." u'They did not honor our OpenTable reservation. Very unprofessional. Will not be referring them to any friends/family/colleagues.' u'Hole in the wall hibachi spot decent portions chef was great kept us entertained throughout. Food was a bit salty swimming in soy sauce but for a quick dinner while traveling for work this place was great. \n\nTry the Hibachi scallops honestly if they would of had spice/hot sauce available would of been 5 star.' u'Portions were okay for the price. I came with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday and they gave me a complementary dessert which was shaved ice (pretty good). Staff was nice and the chef was friendly did a couple of tricks too. I got the lobster and chicken dinner entree loved the lobster but the chicken was a bit dry. They also gave everyone two bowls of soup one on the house and another came with our orders. Overall it was a good experience!'],0.4926,0.444,0.556,0.0
180.Bolivian Llama Party,[u"It's a party for your mouth!\nYum yum.\n\nI stumbled upon this place and got the chicken sandwich. Great stuff.\nHave since gone back for the brisket. I think the secret ingredient must be crack.\nOh. So. Good." u"I got to check this place out the other day as I met up with a friend for lunch.  This place is one of the stands in the Turnstyle market which is a pretty cool underground mini food and shopping area located inside of the Columbus Circle subway station.  It's a small place and you can bring your food to one of the tables they have throughout the market.  Not a lot of space but it gets the job done and isn't too uncomfortable.  They have a display of items in the front which is nice because you can see what things look like before you order.  Seems like the whole place has a somewhat trendy and hipster type of vibe to it.  \n\nI definitely have to disagree with the current 4.5 rating which is inflated for sure.  I ended up getting a triple pork chola sandwich and a passion fruit drink which seemed like pretty standard items.  Overall the sandwich was tasty; it had pretty good flavor but the shredded pork was definitely dry and should have been much more moist.  I did like the coleslaw stuff they put in the sandwich; it definitely added crunch and a good complimentary flavor to the pork.  My passion fruit drink was tasty and I definitely felt the quality difference between it and something like an Arizona Mucho Mango.\n\nWith that said I always look at value as the #1 aspect of my ratings.  The sandwich was pretty freaking small overall.  For $10-12 the size of the item is pretty unacceptable by my standards.  Even worse the drink I got was tinyyyyy.  I thought it would come in like a standard 16 oz cup but the cup it came in was 10 oz at best.  I apologize for my lack of pictures of it as I was in a rush.  But it was bad.  Total price of my meal was $15.79.  I'm not sure if I got overcharged for anything but $16 for what I got is a definite rip off.  \n\nSo in conclusion I'm giving this 2 stars.  The sandwich and drink were definitely tasty but I felt it needed to be about $6-8 cheaper overall to warrant a good rating." u"A Great Experience \n\nI've never really had Bolivian food before. Although I doubt this place would classify as traditional Bolivian food it does get you kind of close. Being in an underground food court the restaurant has somewhat of a fast food vibe to it. The saltenas were perfection because the outer shell had a nice flaky pastry taste to it. The chicken filling was a little too sweet for me but the spicy green sauce kind of combats this taste. I still do not really understand the difference between a salte\xf1a and an empanada. The brisket mac and queso was absolutely amazing; I could eat that all day. I do not really get how that dish aligns with Bolivian cuisine but I an glad that it is on the menu. I will try the sliders the next time I am in the Columbus Circle area." u"Yaaasss saltenas (NOT empanadas). I had to give this place a try once I was the Eater video on Youtube featuring Bolivian Llama Party. \n\nMy family and I came here for a quick dinner before heading to our Broadway show and it was the perfect light meal. We ordered quite a bit between the 4 of us. The Quinoa Kale Salad (large) Chicken Saltena Beef Saltena 3 sliders and both drinks (Cherimoya & Passion Ginger). \n\nThe kale salad was perfect to share between the 4 of us. The kale was seasoned/massaged well. The quinoa walnuts and dried cranberries added a nice texture. The dressing was just perfectly acidic and the mushrooms and cheese added that extra something special. Very good! (But not a must).\n\nOf the two saltenas we ordered my personal favorite was the chicken. There was lots of yummy juices inside both. I just liked the flavor of the chicken more. The saltena dough was nice and crispy and didn't get soggy as quickly as I thought it would because of all the juices. The green sauce that comes with them is quite spicy I heard (from my sister - I wasn't down to try). \n\nThe sliders were good. Very flavorful. Not my favorite though but thats just me. The slaw added a nice crunch and acidity to the meat. \n\nAs for the drinks the Cherimoya was nice and sweet while the Passion Ginger was more refreshing. I was a little worried before I taste tested it that it would be too gingery but it wasn't! I tasted more passion fruit than ginger so the flavors balanced each other really well. \n\nI would HIGHLY recommend you try out this stall in that underground subways eatery area! Service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious and flavorful! I wish we had something like this in LA! Please consider opening up an LA branch!!! :D" u"Drool...this place is amazing. Very flavorful and nice person at the cash register.  Thanks for turning me on to them Yelpers!\n\nShared a Triple Pork Chola (Roast Pig Bacon Pork Belly Cracklin').  I loved it my husband LURVED it." u"If you've never been before please note this place is located underground- go down a subway entrance at the corner of 57th st and 8th ave. \n\nI think the triple pork and the brisket sliders are tasty but nothing that blew me away. The beef was also really strongly flavored with fennel so don't get it if you're not a fennel fan. \n\nThe Cochala saltena was really good and they made sure to make it clear that it was NOT an empanada (it was essentially the same thing as a large empanada). I liked this the most but be aware that it was a fairly sweet filling." u"Wow wasn't expecting food so tasty and delicious in a subway station.  No wonder the rave reviews." u"Ok first of all this was my 1st time in Turnstyle. What an awesome idea! And so well put together.\n\nAnyway back to the food. I love saltenas but never know where to find them (not a lot of bolivian food where I live). This little spot produces awesome eats and the staff were very nice. I had decided I was going to get a Saltena and a cholalita (like a slider) but wasn't sure which meat. The cashier gave me her recs and I was not disappointed. The food was definitely hot fresh and quite tasty!\n\nDefinitely look forward to visiting Turnstyle and BLP on my next visit" u"I love having meetings in the city it gives me a chance to explore and experiment with tasty foods. Today I had the opportunity to try Bolivian Llama. I ordered a Chicken Salte\xf1a The best way to describe this savory sweet treat is by imagining a Jamaican patty and Spanish Empanada having a baby it was a delicious crossover of the two. \n\nThe inside was chewy with very tender chicken eggs and soupy goodness almost like a stew. I had to use a knife and fork because it can get quite messy. If you're in the neighborhood and need a quick bite to eat give this place a try." u"This is an absolute gem tucked away in the many shops that make up 'turnstyle' - the subterranean food court that is part of the Columbus Circle subway station. \n\nThe saltenas were messy and delicious as advertised. The green sauce they give with it adds a much needed balance to them since they could start feeling a bit sweet as you keep eating. The revelation for us was the triple pork sandwich which was juicy and full of flavor. Make sure to ask for it to be made spicy if you like some heat - you won't be disappointed!\n\nThe best way to get here is via the 57th and 8th subway entrance. Highly recommended for a bite to eat when you're passing by or even worth a special visit." u"This was my first time visiting TurnStyle and it was fun. It's basically a underground shopping area right before you get to the entrance of the train. Truth be told I only really came here because Jocelyn K was practically begging me to come here since she has some pretty hardcore food obsessions and this is one of them. \n\nThe food:\n\nChimba Saltena- Free-range chicken aji amarillo. I liked the texture of the crimping it was nice and crunchy but the rest of the dough was a tad too soft for me. The chicken and hard boiled egg was nice and I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce but I felt the sauce was too sweet. Also all the saltenas have a lot of sauce so be careful!!! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rxp4LJvQ8P3czOc0RwF7pg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nMac and cheese with Brisket- The mac was interesting and unique I tried the one that had brisket and it was a good protein. The mac doesn't really seem cheesy but the flavor was good it was not too greasy and I like the fact that there was a hint of heat to it to cut some of the richness. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PbbDFpdaBty2-r9FtvlLfg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nCliza Saltena- Smoked oyster mushrooms & quinoa. I thought this was just OK I enjoyed the crimping as well but the taste of the mushrooms didn't do much for me I would go chicken over mushroom saltenas. Also I thought the filling on this was too sweet." u"My favorite combo is the chimba salte\xf1a + small salad + small meatless mac. MAMMA MIA! Also 99% of the staff are the sweetest people ever. Love this place. I work nearby and it's a godsend." u"I might have to take a flight to New York to eat at this place again. The saltenas are amazing. Fantastic layered flavors that leave your mouth wanting more. There nothing like cutting into the pastry and piping hot goodness seeps out. We also had sliders that were just as good. I love a place that is not afraid to season. They seasoned perfectly without overwhelming the food. Inside a train stop it's truly a New York experience" u"The food here is so good! I always see the little stands in the Columbus Circle station when I pass through the area but I never really paid much attention to what was being offered. It's thanks to Yelp that I stumbled across BLP with a friend looking for some food. With all the good reviews I just had to try it myself. I ordered cunapes while my friend ordered a salte\xf1a and we split a brisket mac and cheese. Everything was delicious! The flavors and rich and savory and I was so upset when I reached the end of my food. At a little more than $21 for everything we ordered it was a bit on the pricey end for me - then again this is more of a snack spot but I came hungry for an entire meal. For a delicious snack hands down I would recommend BLP but for a meal I may consider looking elsewhere." u"Chilly Saturday afternoon and a good time to wander the underground area that is Turnstyle. Despite being lunch time no line at the Llama Party so took the time to go through the menu.\n\nLots of delicious looking meat options - settled on the Cala Cala Saltena ($8) and a spicy Arnold Palmer drink ($4). Saltena was warmed up fairly quickly and served to me with the drink. A little worried it was a microwaved monstrosity but the inside had a still very juicy brisket that required no additional hot sauce. The drink is your regular lemonade/ice tea combo but with added spices I couldn't put my finger on. A surprisingly filling meal for a quick fix.\n\nLady behind the counter is nice and patiently goes through options. Not a huge fan of the prices but I can't complain since I was satisfied after eating. Not a lot of seating here so have to take around and enjoy." u'I have been looking for this place forever little did i realize it was in a subway stop! \n\nSurrounded by a plethora of options of what to eat you walk by this Llama party place and are drawn in by their aromas. \n\nHypes:\n- Saltenas-  its like an empanada with a rich flavorful filling and a sweet outer crust. Its GOOD. I wish they were fried fresh that would just change its game but its still something worth getting\n- Burgers - I got their pork burger and it was flavorful and delicious. \n\nGripes:\n- 6 dollars may be too much for a saltena - but it is quite filling. Make sure they give you the chutney sauce to eat with it\n- seating' u'The food here was incredibly tasty and the service was fair if a little slow. I didn\'t understand all the fuss about the "empanadas" I got a beef one and wasn\'t impressed it was basically crusted beef stew. We DID however enjoy the salad the sliders (we ordered both pork and beef) and the chicken sandwich was also pretty scrumptious. The prices were fair if a little on the higher end- but hey it\'s New York so we were satisfied. There is no seating in the tiny room only enough for the staff to cook and customers to order. So feel free to eat directly outside of the room at the tables and mingle with guests from other restaurants!!\n\nAlso- it\'s important to understand that Bolivian Lama Party as well as many other highly-rated Yelp restaurants are IN THE SUBWAY area. Bon appetit!' u'Addicting Addicting Amazing! Yes its worth $6!!!\n\nWhat is it ? What is a Bolivian Llama party? However you define it its absolutely amazing! Its like this next level empanada looking contraption on steroids. I was wondering what this place was when I was exploring all the little places to eat in 59th street Columbus circle train station. These saltenas are so next level its not even funny. The outer shell is this like sweet salty thick texture. The inside is filled with this perfectly seasoned meat. I can not stress enough how you need to try a saltena! Get extra napkin it can get messy! Lets just say I can write another paragraph but the main point is meat like stew inside of this thick empanada shell with a hard boiled egg inside like what? SO AMAZING!!! Beef Saltena!!\n\nNote: Eat it hot! Grab a table outside yes its not the greatest to eat inside of 59th street Columbus circle underground but hey its so worth it.' u"I was passing through the Turnstyle shops and decided to get takeout for dinner. Ordered a sandwich for my fiance and got a small container of the Mac and cheese. I'm glad I did because it was very good! Definitely would keep this place in mind in case I'm in the neighborhood again and need a meal." u"Salte\xf1as are on point here!  Imagine eating a buttery flaky sweet almost like cornbread pot pie or empanada.  Salte\xf1as are Bolivian in Origen and are their version of an empanada that is baked.  Upon first bite the piping hot juice/sauce burst forth from my plate.  It was filled with various herbs and tender perfectly cooked dark chicken thigh meat.  The sauce itself was so rich and divine - I could devour another chimba salte\xf1a any day. \n\nIt's a pretty solid meal and for $8.75 (including tax) it filled me up pretty well prior to my swim. I would definitely recommend this place and now my journey to find the best salte\xf1as in New York begins!"],0.8655,0.393,0.607,0.0
195.Akdeniz Mediterranean Restaurant,[u'I loved Adkeniz for dinner. Food is very flavorful and fresh service was quick as hell and decor is pretty cozy and exotic. Good for dates. They serve bread while you wait too. \n\nOkra entree: recommend! Got it with lamb on the side for an extra $5. Yum. \n\nEggplant in sauce appetizer: delicious. If you like eggplant this is a must. Its flavors are highly eclectic while remaining true to its Turkish origins. \n\nZucchini pancakes: outstanding. Three on a dish. Comes with a sauce on top. Could eat this all day. \n\nGreen tea: really refreshing yet soothing. Got more hot water too. \n\nTurkish custard: solid custard that was free with a Yelp mention! It satisfied my sweet tooth while not being too sweet. Dope way to end the meal.' u"As being originally from Istanbul Turkey and after trying couple of Turkish places this place is my favorite Turkish restaurant in Manhattan. The food is excellent always fresh well served and delicious. The service is fast enough; the next food comes right in time but you also don't feel rushed.\n\nIf you want to experience high quality Turkish food and if you are curious how a Turkish restaurant looks like this place is a perfect candidate to experience it. \n\nFive stars!" u'Amazing place to have a nice dinner great atmosphere would love to there all the time. \nThe most leanest delicious food I have ever eaten in MANHATTAN. \nKeep up the good work guys!!!!' u"The gyro sandwich was a burrito and the hummus comes with only one piece of what they are calling pita bread. We just ordered from here expecting the gyro sandwich to be on traditional pita bread and the hummus to come with more than one slice of 1 inch thick bead. \n We were disappointed & called and they said they don't have typical pita bread. I would suggest calling it a wrap instead of a gyro sandwich." u"This place has excellent Turkish cuisine. The menu is varied and very well executed. They serve a couple of Turkish wines which is a nice touch. We ate vegetarian and had some of the most flavorful dishes. The chef obviously cares about those who don't eat meat because our dishes were outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant." u'A great place to have dinner. Food was great and service was quick and excellent. I highly recommend for Turkish cuisine.' u"I've eaten here twice around the holidays when I was meeting a friend. It's always busy when I'm there but we are able to get a table.\n\nI think the food quality is good but pricing feels a bit too high (reason for 4 not 5). I've been to some amazing Turkish places in the city and their pricing was better. I always appreciate the dishes and grape leaves." u'This quite possibly is the best Mediterranean restaurant in the city.  I order from here multiple times a week for myself and for others.  The food service both in-house & delivery is consistently way above 5 star.  If you love lebni then Akdeniz is a must on your next visit to midtown.' u"It was such a nice restaurant we ordered Beef kebab(Tenderloin) and Chicken Adana kebab. Beef kebab was ok but the chicken Adana was dry enough for me. I loved the Cacik(Tziki) souse. Anyway it's good restaurant" u"A fairly standard Turkish affair. We had the lamb and chicken shish dishes with appetizers of humus and falafel. I say it in that order as that is the order things arrived I am pretty sure they forgot the appetizers when I asked them but it never got acknowledged.\n\nI quite liked the chicken shish cooked nicely and quite tasty. The rice/salads on the side were good but it is just rice and salad. The humus and falafels were fine too.\n\nService was basically non-existent apart from during ordering we weren't spoken too at all (and the ordering didn't go well). It wasn't busy either...\n\n3 stars for the food minus 1 for the experience." u"My wife and I stumbled across this place walking by.\n\nWe had an excellent dinner.\n\nThe lamb chops were great.  The chicken shish kebab was even better.\n\nBe SURE to get the cheese pastries to start.  You'll thank me later." u"Went here for a dinner with coworkers. They enjoyed the food the fish was cooked perfectly another colleague got a lamb fish which she enjoyed and I had a salad. Appetizer bread was good. I wish the baba ghanoush had more flavor and the grape leaves were good but different than what I'm used to back in Chicago. these were sweeter and had pine nuts in them. All in all I thought it was okay we have really awesome Mediterranean in Chicago so I have high expectations. Dinner for 3 was $122." u'We ordered from here for a luncheon at work and the food was delicious everyone loved their dish and said they would be going there again!!!' u"Came on a Tuesday afternoon 5:00PM completely empty. We were seated right away and service was good. Food wasn't great. Rice was salty but my chicken adana didn't have salt. Weird. Should change quality of food especially since there is so much competition in the area." u'We have been here several times. All of them were very pleasant experiences. The cold appetizers are very good: lebni babagannus humus. Fresh and tasty. You can eat adana which is a traditional turkish kebab it is also delicious  but they also have plenty of entree to select from. I recommend baklava for dessert. Overall Very pleasant restaurant friendly and kind owner and waiters.' u"This is a review from a Turkish Mediterranean: the food is just ok not good. It is basically commercialized Manhattan priced Turkish restaurant lookalike. When you are around hungry and couldn't find anything else to eat then you can stop by. \n\nGelirken ***** vermek umuduyla geldim. Ama \u015fehirleraras\u0131 otob\xfcs restoranlar\u0131ndaki yeme\u011fe 100$ vermek hi\xe7 iyi gelmedi. \xc7izdim hocam \xfczg\xfcn\xfcm." u"This restaurant may seem like a hole in the wall it is a true gem delicious Turkish food. If you're looking for a lumber jack sized sampling please order the mixed grill.  My wife or the shish kebab and fell love with it." u"Fantastic food and service! Cozy. Friendly and attentive staff. Didn't wait at all for food drinks etc. not rushed." u"Incredible restaurant with delicious food beautiful decor and kind accommodating staff. My favorites here are the baby okra the salmon and the Barbequed Meatballs. I discovered okra here (had it for the first time) and was so impressed with how they cook it - not too mooshy perfectly spiced just right. I took my grandparents here - they are 80 years old and have lived in multiple countries. They said that this was their favorite cuisine and I have to agree. I've had dozens of lunches here dates with my wife and a few dinners and every time I come I feel like I am coming to a little house in Turkey with wonderful people who want to cook for me. I've tried 34 Turkish restaurants in New York and this is my favorite one in Manhattan." u"Decent food with moody servers .\nUnless is there is no other place around I wound go again . Also there is no alcohol served in the place . When I asked for a beer I was given a blasphemous look . Regarding the mood of the sever I asked about the grilled calamari salad and I still received it ( and paid ) without ordering it .\nMemo to stuff  don't mumble ask if you don't understand or repeat the order back to a customer . If you are having a bad day  take the day off and stay home."],-0.5423,0.0,0.774,0.226
141.Momosan Ramen & Sake,[u"This place is amazing! I can't get enough! The food blows your mind away. I tell you the place is very clean very authentic very cozy and it has a great vibe. I ordered the tantan and my boyfriend got the Tokyo chicken and you can't go wrong with either of them different flavors but both are satisfying in their own way. For appetizers you can't come here without trying sticky ribs and the duck tacos. I repeat you cannot come here without getting the sticky ribs and the duck tacos. We tried a bunch of other things and it was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasing. \n\nOn top of the delicious food the service and the warm welcoming we had from Richard was top notch. His knowledge of the menu from what are the best appetizers to noodles to sake's had us wanting to try everything! Richard was very attentive and if you come here and want to know what is the best thing to order from the menu you have to sit in Richard's section. \n\nTantan sticky ribs duck tacos we shall meet again!" u"To be honest I no longer have a North Star (no alpha flight) when it comes to ramen. Texas NYC Hong Kong the DMV - I just like the genre as a whole. Like a 6 year old and pizza\n\nSo technically I snuck out of wedding to hit this spot up. (Love ya cousin!) And  skullduggery always makes food taste better.\n\nService was prompt and fast and the restaurant was 80-90% full. Big up the Dominican hostess!  New Yorkers complain about service but come to DC! Slow and mean.\n\nDecor is what you would expect Scandinavian leanings with Japanese leanings. Not the hip and happening frenetic energy style that is associated with hip kids actually in Japan.  Perfect neighborhood joint if Manhattan is your hood. Nice but not Eleven Madison nice..\n\nTonkotsu and gyoza like non Australian version of ribeye and a blooming onion or Solomon Gundy and Dragon Stout - classic pairings\n\nI've definitely had better tonkotsu but this was great. The gyoza came with a nice green sauce (not pesto or wasabi). There was some cabbage on the plate that was not kimchi but tasted a whole lot like kimchi. I'm not gonna jump in that whole debate that Japan ganked everything cool from Korea....but\n\nNice eatery" u"I wasn't really impressed with the ramen I got a lunch set up with a small Ramen and side of the thinly sliced pork over rice.\n\nThe sliced pork over rice was well flavored but wasn't anything special. \n\nThe broth of the tonkatsu was actually pretty decent I liked the piece of seaweed and noddles. \n\nOur friends said that the chicken broth was better than the pork maybe I will try that next time to give it a fair chance." u"Was craving for ramen and was around the area so decided to come here since I had this place bookmarked for awhile. So glad I decided to come! Came around 5:30pm on a Saturday and they just opened for their night shift. No wait and no line. That's the best part!\n\nOur server Michael was super kind and friendly! If you get him as a server you're lucky! Had great recommendations of what to get since it was our first time here and had very attentive service. Everything he recommended tasted really good. They also have a huge selection of sake and beer for all you alcoholic lovers!\n\nHere's what my friends and I ordered:\n1) YAKI SALMON: When I took my first bite I was in love. The salmon belly melts in your mouth and was super flavorful and delicious. Definitely a must get!\n\n2) KAKUNI BAO: Very good pork belly buns. My friend and boyfriend really enjoyed it. Nothing too special though from other pork belly buns we had though at other places. \n\n3) TONKOTSU RAMEN: My friend really enjoyed her noodles. She said the pork belly was one of the best she ever had and it melts in her mouth. She also really enjoyed her broth. \n\n4) GYUKOTSU RAMEN: The fact that they only serve 20 per day caught my attention. I really wanted to see what the hype was all about. Luckily they still offered it when we got there. My boyfriend really enjoyed it. He finished everything! I really enjoyed it as well. The braised beef rib was very soft and flavorful and I'm not a huge beef type of person. I love that they served kale with the ramen! One of my favorite part of the whole ramen itself. Only thing I didn't like about the ramen was that it was way too peppery. Had too much pepper inside the ramen but other than that it was great! \n\nOverall service was amazing and food was great. Definitely a ramen spot I'll come back to in the future!" u'Ordered the tonkatsu ramen since both the specialty ramens were already sold out. Added the braised pork option. Delicious rich broth flavorful but dainty chashu pork and of course the pickled veggies... Just a well rounded bowl.\n\nAlso tried the dumplings and they were okay. Loved that they had soy sauce and vinegar on hand so I could enjoy them like from my childhood. The preparation was awesome. Crispy but not burnt pork filling was good too but not super flavorful even with the scallion ginger topping.' u"Yummy ramen and don options. The lunch set is a pretty good deal at $16.50 including a choice of ramen and don. For $3 more you can add two pork/cabbage steamed dumplings or a pork bun. I chose the tonkatsu pork ramen which was very tasty and included pork belly and an egg in it (I hate when you have to pay extra for the egg...of course I want the signature egg in my ramen!). For my don I got the tuna Pok\xe9 one and although it didn't have a ton of fish I was very satisfied with the overall portion of the meal. Definitely a hearty lunch. The dumplings were also worth it. \n\nOther ramens include chicken and a spicy coconut curry. They also have a beef and pork don as well as a curry don. \n\nQuick and friendly service!" u"Ramen!  Ramen!  Ramen! \nBut this ain't that ordinary instant ramen from your local Walmart my friend! \nThis place IS the shit!  Yes it is!\nYou have to sit in Richard's section!  He's a doll and super attentive.  The restaurant is trendy and hip and very busy.  Even so we were seated right away with out a reservation. \nThe Curry Tukani Reg with pork Belly was awesome but my fav was the Tonkotsu with Kakuni-slow braised melt-in-your-mouth pork Belly...OH.MY.YUMMINESS!Oh. Also worth trying are the Peking Duck tacos and pork dumplings.  Trust me!  The noodles were perfect the broth so good that I wanted to swim in it.  You cannot go wrong with their great Sake selection either!\nGreat atmosphere\nGreat service\nGreat Food" u"Very high quality ingredients. It was delicious. The Momosan ramen bone broth tastes nourishing. The square noodles and square chopsticks surprisingly were a little difficult to eat but I was also in a rush. The noodles were nice and chewy. My favorite is still Ippuddo because the flavors are deeper and complex but while satisfying I don't have a sense I'm eating something good for me." u"My friend and I had a late dinner here on Sunday night and there was a healthy crowd in the restaurant. Go later to avoid waiting. \n\nEnjoyed the waviness of the noodles and texture more than Ippudo. Thought the broths were fantastic and didn't leave we thirsty later due to the added MSG." u'I enjoyed the Tonkotsu ramen at Momo-san. The broth was relatively light in terms of richness. I especially loved the ramen noodles. The noodles were thin and curly. The kikurage (wood ear) mushrooms and scallions are nice traditional ramen veggies. The takana (pickled mustard leaf) added an interesting pickled taste which contrasts with the savory broth. I was disappointed that the half egg tasted like it was out of the refrigerator. I would love to come back and try the other ramen bowls and dons at Momosan.' u"Not my all time favorite ramen place in the city but still a good choice to go to with a few friends. \n\nI went with a group of 6 people during a weekday and we were seated right away but it was certainly getting packed later in the night and I hear the weekend waits are much longer so plan around that! We all got different dishes (all ramen) and were content and happy for the most part. \n\nI got the small sized portion of ramen with pork. I really liked that they had this smaller option because I wasn't that hungry at the time for a whole\nhuge bowl. I haven't seen this much and the price was only $11 how can you beat that? I thought the broth and pork were good but would have liked 1 or 2 more pork slices. My friends got the larger pork and chicken ramen dishes. They thought the broth was a little too salty and enjoyed the pork over the chicken. They also got the soft shell crab buns which were super unique!\n\nThe staff was friendly and the place is pretty big so it was a nice night overall." u'Good sized crowd with bar and communal seating. Service was fast and friendly. Per the staffs recommendation we tried the slow cooked beef ramen for $25.The menu states that there are only 20 bowls available per day. So I guess I must be fortunate enough to score a bowl.I was surprised that the order arrived within 5-8 minutes. \nTasted like beef noodle with fall of the bone tender beef. Something different from the usual pork or chicken ramen.' u"This place seems to be quite busy as we tried a week prior to eating here with no avail. The wait wait over an hour at around 7 on a Friday. When we got there around 5 on a Thursday there was no wait but they did make us wait until our entire party had arrived before seating us. Upon being seating the server greeted us with some water and swiftly explained to us the menu and the specials. I ordered the tonkotsu with kakuni which is their 6 hour braised pork belly. The chasui and the kakuni were both very good. The chasui was very savory while the kakuni was melt-in-your-mouth soft with a hint of sweetness which tasted amazing. The broth though was a little salty and had me drinking a couple glasses of water to dilute all the sodium. Overall this is a very good ramen spot to go to. \nPS my friend loved it so much he came back the very next day. So it's definitely worth a try." u"The staff was friendly attentive and helpful. They offered to explain the menu as it was my first time there and explained the changes to the menu to my boyfriend who had been there once before.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value. You can get a small ramen and small don for $16.50. For an additional $3 you can add 2 pieces of gyoza or a kakuni (braised pork belly) bun. My boyfriend and I both ended up getting the lunch set with the tonkotsu ramen and the gyudon and added the kakuni bun.\n\nWhile the staff and environment were great and the lunch set is a good deal the food itself was lacking.\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was mediocre. The noodles were a bit too soft for my liking there was a disproportionate amount of mushroom the broth was not rich enough with the flavors of pork you'd expect in a good tonkotsu and the egg was also a bit too overcooked edging on a hard boiled egg rather than a nice soft boiled egg expected in ramen. The pork chashu itself was good though; it practically melted in my mouth but there wasn't enough of it.\n\nThe gyudon was good and decently flavorful. There was sufficient amounts of meat to accompany the white rice. Nothing about it particularly stood out though.\n\nThe kakuni bun was the most disappointing part of our meal. The braised pork belly was excessively salty the lettuce was just one large wet slab and the mustard mayo was a bit heavy-handed." u"I love a good ramen place such as this one! Came to New York for work and needed to find a place where I can eat alone without getting judged. This place was perfect to eat alone since you can sit by the bar where other solo eaters also sit as well. I ordered the tan tan ramen and a pork belly bun and they were both amazingly delicious...\n\npork belly - it was so fatty and soft it literally melted the moment I put it in my mouth. it was an amazing surreal experience.....the bun was so soft and the texture was just right on the money...\n\ntan tan ramen tasted so good I contemplated ordering another bowl.....ramen noodle was cooked perfectly and that broth was so flavorful I couldn't contain myself.....man that broth was so good I wanted to cry.\n\nDefinitely a spot you need to check out if you are from the city!!" u'I was hovering from 2 to 2.5 stars.  I pushed my friend to take the trek to momosan since I was overall impressed with the reviews.  But unfortunately this place didn\'t impress me. \n\nSeating:\nGot here on a Saturday around 10 pm place was still booming with customers but was able to get a seat at the bar very quickly.  Parties of 1-2 are designated to the bar while parties of 3-4 are designated to the tables.  The bar seating wasn\'t very comfortable the stools are not moveable so I often had to awkwardly slide in and out.  A larger person or someone with thicker legs will definitely experience some trouble.\n\nI was seated at the edge of the bar there\'s a swinging door and employees often crowded right next to me while talking to each other or went in and out the bar.  The door often swung violently since workers are in a rush.   One employee got hit by the door and she hurriedly walked away saying "ouch" under her breath.  You know that unwanted table in restaurants next to the swinging kitchen door...?  My seat is probably the equivalent to that.\n\nFood/Drinks:\nThis is clearly more of a bar than a restaurant so there\'s no other drinks other than alcohol available.  There\'s no tea or other non alcoholic beverages so I stuck with water (which had something floating in it...)\n\nRamen came super quick I ordered a tonkotsu while my friend had the Tokyo chicken.  The person who took our order almost messed up assuming we both were getting tonkotsu but that disaster was inadvertently avoided.  The broth I got wasn\'t as oily as others indicated so I was okay with it both the Tokyo chicken and tonkotsu broth had good flavor.  \n\nThe proportion of ramen was a bit small for me the chashu was sliced to about 2-3 mm thickness----very thin and there\'s only 3 pieces the chashu was tender though.  \n\nI also ordered 1 Peking duck taco it was yummy but VERY tiny for $5.  The sauce is sweet and had a fruity note to it.  Duck was moist and juicy and paired well with the crispy fried wonton outter shell.  A person sitting down the bar ordered gyozas which smelled phenomenal but 4 pieces for $10 will break my heart and my wallet. \n\nI\'m the type who never finishes her dish and ends up with leftovers.  But I left here hungry...\n\nAlthough the broth was overall good it didn\'t win me over.  There\'s other ramen places in the city to fulfill your ramen needs.  I was hoping to get a t-shirt but the design is not really appealing I legit love watching Morimoto on TV but momosan wasn\'t worth bragging about through a tshirt.\n\nOverall I do not recommend dining here for a legit meal like dinner maybe it\'s an okay place if you just want to bar hop and want sustenence for the alcohol.  I think it\'s also better to come here during lunch hours since there\'s lunch specials.' u"I had an overall decent experience here.\nFood is 3.5 stars\nService 4 stars\n\nI came at 515pm thursdag and there was no line or anything. Not crowded at all\n\nPeking duck taco: it was ok. Not much to rave about. Just peking duck with hoisin sauce on a taco instead of bao. I prefer the ones served at the Chinese restaurants with the bao.\n\nSoft shelled crab bao- pretty good. Much better and complex interesting  flavors than the Peking duck taco. One of the best things I ate tonight.\n\nPig ears- nice and crunchy. I enjoyed snacking on them. Love the texture of the cartilage snapping. \n\nRaw tuna appetizer- also delicious and complex spicy flavors. Next to the soft shelled crab in terms of best thing I ate tonight.\n\nBeef short rib broth ramen- expensive and not worth it.  It was $25 a bowl and they advertise it as selling only 20 bowls a day. We decided to give it a try. It was pretty good but not $25 good enough. My korean friend and I agree that it tastes like the korean soup.\n\nTantan ramen- first bite. Reminded me of malaysian seafood curry soup noodles. It was decent but not amazing. I'm kinda turned off by how UN-japanese both ramen tasted. Hopefully the tonkotsu ramen would fare much better.\n\nOur waitress was nice. Gave us a detailed review of the sake recommendations." u'Great ramen spot in Murray Hill.\n\nI came here about a month ago (9/5/17) with a friend for lunch.  He wanted ramen and I knew Morimoto had this restaurant close to my office.  We checked it out and really enjoyed our experience.\n\nPatience is a virtue - no reservations accepted.  We did not have to wait to be seated for lunch though I could imagine it gets busy for dinner during peak hours.  The restaurant had a welcoming and trendy vibe.  The layout is nice including bar booth and communal table seating.  We opted for the bar where we shared a nice conversation with those serving us.\n\nWhile we came for the noodles the menu also had a nice selection of don (rice bowls) and appetizers.  We came hungry so were ordered the "lunch set" which includes your choice of ramen don and a side of pickled cabbage.  Double-down on that hunger and add 2 pieces of gyoza and 1 piece of kakuni (braised pork) bao.  The total for all of that was $22.50 which I thought was very reasonable.  I selected the chashu don and Tokyo chicken ramen - both were tasty.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant and I look forward to coming back!' u"This place was UNREAL.  As soon as you walk in you are greeted with an explosion of flavor to your senses.  I think I drooled on my way to the table just based off of the scent.  Not kidding.\n\nThe flavor of the food matched the scent and didn't even tip toe near disappointing.  The broth in the ramen was on point and the noodles were the perfect consistency.  The dumplings were also perfect.\n\nMy fave highlight was the serving of the sake.  I won't ruin the fun... you gotta go to enjoy the tradition yourself!  \n\nService could not have been better!! Thank you!!" u"I could be selective when it comes to ramen. Morimoto's Momosan has been on my list since it had open last year. The lines are still out the door that tells you a lot about a restaurant. Luckily I only had to wait about 10 minutes. The hostess served her purpose but I noticed she was not exactly professional warm and friendly to other patrons. The server was super nice and attentive throughout the entire experience. \n\nThey don't have any hard liquor but they serve a great selection of sake wine beer and sake cocktails. I was not sure which one to get so I ended trying the yuzu cloud and mango matchashu. The Yuzu Cloud was citrusy refreshing and a slightly stronger in sake content than other one. The mango matchashu was lighter and less sweet with a dash of matcha taste to it. Yuzu for the win though.  \n\nHere at Momosan Chef Morimoto shows pride into the ramen noodles served here. Morimoto and Sun Noodle have claimed to developed a special type of noodle that is more resistant to becoming Nobiru and I totally agree! I was not slurping my noodles fast enough but my last strand of noodle tasted not too far from my first strand. \n\nSome friends and my sister had raved about the peking duck ramen but it was not available at the time I went. So bet I'll be back to try it again next time. The kakuni bao was far from the best I've ever had the bao was hard and dry the kakuni was not fatty thick flavorful. It was not memorable at all but rather left a disappointing taste. I will not order this again. The peking duck taco was just alright. The fried gyoza skin was pre-made and served at room temperature the house made peking duck was good but the hoisin and apricot sauce was too light. The portion of the peking duck made my taco bite seem a bit hollow. I'd appreciate more duck in my taco. probably won't order this again."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
166.Sean’s Bar & Kitchen,[u'Loved this bar!  Went In for lunch and beer and both were great!  Reasonable (for NY) and good tasting menu items and great beer selection including their own beers on draft.\n\nGood Burgers.  Good fries.  Great atmosphere.  Great Irish Car Bombs!' u'Good place around rockefeller to grab a drink or two\nHouse wines and house beers are served\nTried chandelley which was ok. I was expecting a better white wine\nTortilla chips with spinach artichoke was nice. One should try that with the drinks. The sauce was really cheesy and tasty' u"Another stop for a quick brew and apps. \nWhile deciding where we would go for dinner we decided to meet here for drinks/apps. \nYour standard Irish Pub with typical menu items plus a twist. We were intrigued by their IRISH SHORT RIB NACHOS - waffle fries cheddar-jack cheese...and even more impressed on how good they were. Short rib loaded with non over cooked nachos was a bonus. We also ordered WARM BAKED PRETZELS - ale cheese sauce & Guinness mustard which were on the sweeter side for my liking but still enjoyable. The mustard was definitely better than the cheese sauce in my opinion. Service was spot on and their beer selection (I only prefer draft) was loaded with IPA's and different style brews...\nWould absolutely return for their entr\xe9e menu and to try some additional brews...ENJOY!" u"Food was great! Service was great! Beer was great!\nI'd highly recommend Sean's while in NYC!!" u"Since we wanted to be near Rockefeller Center after lunch Sean's was a great find nearby. \n\nThe dining area is large with a second floor dining area as well.  The service here could have been a bit more attentive and friendly.   We were visiting at an off time so there weren't very many customers there at the time.  I feel as if our waiter may have dropped the ball.\n\nIn spite of the service our food was great.  We ordered the Warm Baked Pretzels to start.   The pretzels were good.  But when you dip them in the ale cheese sauce it just makes them great.  Definitely fresh and would recommend.  \n\nFor the main attraction we split the Huntsman Cheese Steak.  This is an open faced NY Strip Sandwich topped with applewood bacon bbq onions and Irish cheddar on garlic crostini.  After one bite I was an instant fan.  The dancing flavors of ingredients swirled in my mouth.   And yes this would be on my recommendation list for certain.  \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back for more on my next trip to the city." u"We were in a bit of a rush to eat and this place couldn't have been faster. Plus the food is shockingly good. I usually associate pubs with solid burgers and this one didn't disappoint. The French fries were just okay a bit underwhelming but the burger itself wasn't. Super filling and the cheddar / bacon combo was great. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was arguably the spinach and artichoke dip though. It's served in a crock typically used for French onion soup and it very much has that element to it with a layer of melted cheese resting atop the dip tucked away inside. Plus the cheese is gruyere cheese which made it that much better. A large enough portion perfect for the table to share. \n\nMy only real complaint is that a soda costs $3.50 and there are no refills! I can understand if you want to charge that much but at least offer refills. I mean it's a pub with burgers and sports on the tv how do you not offer refills on non-alcoholic drinks?" u"When we first came in we weren't sure if we had to sit at the bar since we're only getting drinks but we were a table of 8. But the waiters were great and let us have a table top. \n\nThey have 54 beers on tap but only one cider which is Magners and that's the most basic. I got their signature cocktail on tap which is tullamore dew ginger juice lime juice and mint garnish. It's super delish but a little pricy at $13 considering it's a house cocktail. \n\nWe ordered the short rib nachos but they weren't even nachos THEY WERE WAFFLE FRIES! Super delicious and the short ribs were cooked well and not tough. Our friends got yuca fries which were delicious! It came with sriracha ketchup which was a little too spicy for me but I still enjoyed it. \n\nOne thing was that when I placed my drinks order I had asked for water for the table and it didn't arrive for more than 5 minutes. When a server came to bring us plates I had to ask again for the water. \n\nI would definitely come back because they have solid food and a wide beer selection." u"Nice little find for us.  Stopped in for lunch and were impressed by the atmosphere first off. Very cool Irish pub themed spot. Just enough background noise and music and pretty well full.  Servers were brilliant!  Attentive friendly and Irish!!  Haha  food was above average pub fare... I love pub food but the food here was well above expectations. Had fish and chips quesadillas and some smaller apps (it was a while ago so I can't remember... Sorry about that).  This place is on my favorites when in NYC.  My other favorite Irish spot has slipped down and Sean's has topped the list. :)" u'Prices are average for a times Square pub but i kinda like this place.\n\nThe $10 duck wontons are fantastic - very similar to those cheese/lobster wontons you get at your favorite chinese take-out but more "gourmet". They don\'t really taste like duck though\n\n$10 Bacon Jam & blue cheese flatbread also amazing. I think it\'s only a special but it\'s really really good. \n\n$13-14 for a burger and fries. PRETTY good overall. The bun is perfectly toasted and the burger patty is decent. Looked like it was frozen and a bit overcooked but still juicy.\n\nFries  are above average. Pretty nice.\n\n$14 Curry panini special also pretty good. If you like indian food it tastes very much like an indian chicken curry you might have for takeout.\n\nThe $10 3-beer flight is great for anyone who wants to try new stuff. They have about 50 beers on tap and 20 of them are seasonal.\n\nOn Monday\'s they supposedly have a lunch special that gets you 2 entrees for $20.\n\nOverall - a nice spot I keep coming back to.' u'Fairly new bar in the neighborhood finally stopped by to check it out. \nWe came in & sat at the bar at first glance this place is whoa .. a little overwhelming with so much staring at you. \nOnce settled we started with some drinks I went with Bacardi & Diet Coke my friend had a Stella decent Bacardi can\'t go wrong with beer. \nDrinking always brings up an appetite we decide to get an order of the Calamari very good calamari they add some Spicy to it not bad gives it a nice kick good dipping sauce with the marinara sauce very tasty.  \nI stuck to Barcari my friend ended up switching to Jack good as well. \nA round of Patron silver made its way in.. niceee always a good choice. \nNice looking place typical bar/pub decor plenty of TV\'s to grab your attention nice size for the restaurant with seating below good bar area & an upper level for more dinning space. \nLiked the keg table stand different touch but loved the Grey goose "chandelier" makes u really thirsty just looking at it cool touch for the place. \nService at the bar was good price wise decent good atmosphere another decent bar to check out in the neighborhood.' u"I had a great time at this restaurant the other day. I thought they had a large selection of beer consistent in price with other bars in this section of Manhattan. I found that their food was delicious.\n\nI ordered their Campfire Burger (Angus Beef BBQ Onions Bacon and Chipotle mayo) it was sooo good! Their fries were also nice (would have liked a few more personally). I think they had good presentation probably the container in which the fries sat made it look like there were less instead of a good portion. Personally when fries come with a burger I prefer on the plate makes the plate look more full. But I think the fries in the cup also had a more professional look which is appealing. Look at me... I'm rambling about insignificant fries haha\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere we came in during dinner time on a Thursday and there was a good amount of seating available. I heard from a few friends they have a good 2nd story bar too to accompany their 1st story bar. Will check out another time.\n\nOverall great experience. Our waitress checked on us often which some may find intrusive but I like because I prefer that over constantly trying to get their attention. Thanks for the great meal I will definitely be back! Wish I took some photos! (I always just jump on good food)." u"We were in town for the weekend and stumbled across Sean's Bar & Kitchen. We went for dinner (around 7:30pm) and got seated right away.  Great ambiance inside! Service was excellent and super fast.  There is quite a variety of food and drink options. I was pleasantly surprised by several healthy menu items. You don't find that often in bar/restaurants. We had the roasted brussel sprouts with siracha sauce for an appetizer- amazing! So delicious! And prices are very reasonable. Would highly recommend for a great meal and fun atmosphere!" u"Ordered the smoked duck wontons and the BLT. The wontons were spectacular and I would come back again just for them. I almost wish that's all I ordered because even though there are only 4 it filled me up. \n\nThe BLT was just a little much for me. The avocado made the sandwich too soggy and I was missing the crunch. I also think there was too much fried green tomato in proportion to the bacon. It was just a little off for me. It came with sweet potato fries and they were just right not greasy and not dry.\n\nThey have a wonderful selection of beer and I think they have some great specials so I would come back for that. \n\nI'll just try something new next time because I do think this is a nice bar to eat and drink." u"Great beer selection! Actually as far as drinks go this has everything. I haven't tried any cocktails or martinis but if you want the regular stuff out of a bottle then there's enough for everyone.\n\nI'm not a fan of the food it's all pretty much frozen. It does get loud in here after work so don't make any first date plans! I didn't see any candles on the tables either." u"Standard pub grub and beer in tourist central. I've been here once before seeing a show at Radio City Music Hall. \n\nSeating is plentiful but they start to really pack 'em in as it gets later in the evening. Be prepared to get cozy with your neighbor!\n\nBeer menu is decent. I tried two beers off the menu and had a burger and fries. Burgers seem to be the popular thing here. Again standard. It was yummy and I was full but none of it wowed me." u"We really like this place it is a unique find in the heart of the city not touristy at all and a fun time.  Great for after a game or a show or before a show would be even better!  \nWe hit this place up on our way to Radio City Music Hall (which was great we say the Post Modern Jukebox concert it was a amazing but I digress...).  Back to the review!\n\nAmbiance:\nIt is BIG we had no idea how big it was which was great as there were a lot of different sections to hang out in lots of bars high tops tables whatever you want to do.  The place had a cool and comfortable vibe was cleaner than expected had clean bathrooms and had comfy booth tables too.\n\nService:\nEveryone had an Irish brogue which was awesome.  At first we thought they were putting it on and faking it but it wasn't the case.  Awesome to see some authentic Irish folks in an Irish pub.  They were attentive nice and quick.\n\nFood:\nWe ate all kinds of apps and sandwiches everything was great very tasty.  Definitely recommend eating here.\n\nDrinks:\nGreat of course!  Irish beers clutch." u'Fantastic bar get a beer and a good lunch.\n\nThe Reuben sandwich was amazing.  The beers are delicious.  The atmosphere is good friendly staff a real happy place. Definitely a must vist place.' u'Great food ! I ordered black bean and quinoa. Urgent with avocado and mushrooms . Very filling and tasty . Will definitely come here again !' u"A good Irish bar in Manhattan. Surprised to see many empty tables a Friday night. The food was very good (we ordered fish 'n chips and a blue cheese burger) with a good temperature and the service was ok. However the ambient/music could be better very quiet for an Irish pub in Midtown Manhattan" u'Really enjoyed the food. Spinach & artichoke dip is great.

207.Cafe Abbondanza,[u'This place is a gem hidden right in Time Square! We were looking for a place to eat late night in NYC and found ourselves in a Deli that becomes a restaurant once you are inside! \n\nThe service was great! We ordered cheese steaks and they were delicious the flavor was authentic and not greasy! \nThe prices were reasonable considering the area we were and we will be back for sure! Thank you!' u"This place is decent. I always come here on break because they have seating upstairs where I can watch Netflix and enjoy my food. They have a special discount menu for people who work in the area and the portions are HUGE. I also get the eggs and cheese on a roll which is good. My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while for them to make the food bc it's only one person at the grill and everything is made to order. Some of the snacks and stuff can be overpriced too but it is Manhattan so no surprise there tbh." u"F*** this place. Sorry for using foul language. Last time I was here they gave me a sandwich with a giant cockroach in it. I went into complain and this Korean guy that works there named Tony told me to just deal with it (Not that being Korean is a problem because I'm Korean BUT this guy is definitely from the North!) I was totally flabbergasted (always wanted to use this word)!!! This place is only good to buy beer other than that...they suck!" u"This deli is sketchy and a bit of a tight squeeze but the joy of anytime cheap bagels wins over anything. Yes. Anything. \n\nAlso the drinks selection is out of this world. Seriously... approximately a third of the store is drinks fridges. Perfection but also anxiety because I can't drink 50L of drinks in one day." u"I have worked in the area over 10 years and going to this deli over the past 4 years. I have been noticing numerous pricing issues. They are the most expensive deli in the neighborhood and often charge different rates depending on the customer. The prices on deli purchases are very erratic. Last year all local workers were entitled to 10% off deli items. It then switched to any deli item over $4. This morning I was informed that I am not entitled to the discount because I don't visit often enough (more than once per week). The food is not very good and poor quality and the workers are rude and not very customer service oriented. They are not pleasant and act as if you are bothering them. Do not patronize this place especially if your are a tourist! they will rip you off whether you work in the area or visiting." u'Ok maybe I ordered the wrong thing or was there at the wrong time...but having visited with a sizeable group; consensus was "meh."\n\nPluses: It\'s conveniently close to Times Square\nMinuses: Philly Cheesesteak is overly greasy and tasteless at the same time.  The staff wasn\'t overly friendly and they seemed none to pleased having to serve a large group.\n\nI don\'t mean to be harsh just being honest.' u"I visit this place every morning for oatmeal. It's your typical NYC deli except it's clean and the morning staff (until around 2-3pm) is super friendly. \n\nThey make great sandwiches and salads for lunch. Everything is fresh and tasty. \n\nThe prices are high (it's Times Square so not surprising) but not as high as some other delis in the area. \n\nOther than Cranberry (on 45th) this is the only deli I would venture into in the Times Square area." u"Their burgers & panini's are off the Richter scale! I come here for lunch a bunch of times. The average price for panini's is around 7 not too bad for Times Square. Same for burgers & fries but they are a really good size. ALSO the quesadillas are huge. Deff a bang for your buck. There's an upstairs spot to munch at so you can grab a beer or whatever you want & chill." u"This place was right next to my hotel and I stopped in here twice for a quick bite based on other Yelp reviews.\n\nAs described friendly service great selection of drinks awesome sandwiches with Boar's Head meats.  Had an excellent Italian sub.  Prices are reasonable.\n\nDon't gamble on any of the other sketchy looking delis in the area.  Hit up Cafe Abbondanza!" u"LOVE these people!\n\nfor years we've had to suffer with the deli right next to our building.  and while they've done a passable job making breakfast sandwiches and the occasional turkey burger it really was because it was the only game in town that we patronized.\n\nalso i'm a huge drink guy. i love sodas and teas and waters and the only thing that the next door deli ever had was coke diet coke diet Sunkist and some 3 week old vitamin waters.\n\nteleport across the street to Cafe Abbondanza and you'll find a 15 yard long cooler with every drink imaginable!!!  they even have my diet arizona green tea!!!\n\nthey're the nicest people  make great sandwiches and have no minimum on credit cards.\n\nthis is Titz's spot from now on." u"In a neighborhood chocked full of mediocre multi-purpose delis Abbondanza really stands out.  From the minute I came into this place something looked unusual...it was clean and bright.  But then I noticed that people were pleasant too.  Whah???\n\nThey seem to have a nice array of choices (though I've only been there for coffee and breakfast).  Their coffee is the best within 4 or 5 blocks - for my money you need to go to Cosi for something comparable.  They fix it just the way you like it and serve it with a smile.   I also love the fact that their oatmeal is made with water - not milk and comes with toppings that are tasty healthy and fresh.  Forget Cranberry and Europa and that awful place across the street.  Check out Abbondanza." u"DO NOT GO HERE! Went in one morning to buy bagels and the guy who makes the sandwiches behind the counter wouldn't sell them to me! I'm sorry what? You won't take my money? If I could I wouldn't give them any stars. He is probably one of the rudest people I have ever met. Not even sure why he wouldn't sell me a few bagels completely bizzare and unnecessary behavior." u"My friends and I went here on our trip to NYC because we were starving cold and didn't want to pay for a sit down place. It did not disappoint. The prices were good I got the chicken fajita and a lime diet coke. The fajita was delicious and was very big I couldn't even finish it; if I was staying near by I would've taken it home it was warm cheesy and filling. Also it came with chips which was nice. The only downside was that the seating upstairs was a bit sketchy and tight however; I did appreciate that they had somewhere to sit down. Another positive was the price my food was about $10 which is a steal in consideration of its proximity to Times Square. I would definitely recommend to any traveler or local in the area wanting fast and good food." u"Cafe Abbondanza looked appetizing as we walked past it while filming a documentary of elevators in the theater district.  We stopped by for lunch enjoying a chicken parm wedge a gyro and an order of french fries.  We were particularly happy that Abbondanza served yummy steak fries instead of the crud that some places offer.  Good selection of drinks too -- always nice to see Dr. Brown's among the choices.  Sandwiches were hot and fresh and the service came with a smile.  We'll definitely be going back to Abbondanza if we are in the area again." u'Took long time to get sandwiches and we were trying to get to a show. But the food was good when it finally came through.' u"Used to work right by this place.  I frequented this place for lunch.  I usually ordered some delicious heroes from this place.  I flirted with the cashier and she used to give me extra pickles and chips for free.  I hope the owner doesn't read this and fire her.  She was very nice." u"Horrendous place. Extremely rude guy at the cooking station who behaved like he was doing us a favor by taking our order. They also charge an extra dollar per item if you get breakfast items after 11 AM. The omelette we tried was tasteless and the wrap was of ok. I'm not sure what explains the positive reviews on yelp. Would never go back. They are many more options for breakfast around."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
59.An’Nam,[u"Stopped by for a quick lunch since I was in the area.\n\nWho knew that there was a reasonably priced restaurant like this so close to Time Square! \nIt is really interesting because they have both Vietnamese and Japanese dishes available and I wish i could write about them both. However on this trip I only ordered a lunch special and had 30 minutes to eat.\n\nLunch Special : 3 rolls for 12 dollars  : Spicy Tuna Spicy Salmon Spicy Scallop  \n- includes soup ( or salad... I think )\n\nI was in and out quickly without rushing or worrying about time. The food came quickly and the server was attentive. The food was overall good and satisfied my appetite for a quick non-fancy sushi lunch ( actually not bad at all! One of the better ones on my list)\n\nAn'Nam would definitely be an option for me for lunch or dinner! It would be a great dinner or lunch spot when you are looking for a nice decent meal without breaking the bank!" u"This has quickly become one of my favorite lunch spots. I've ordered on Seamless a few times and there are a couple things that have elevated this to my top 5 lunchtime delivery options.\n\nMost importantly their food is generally really good. The only dish that has fallen a bit short for me is the Vietnamese summer roll. I like a lot of herbs and a solid peanut sauce. They serve theirs with hoisin which is not the same as peanut sauce at all and the lettuce to herb ratio is out of whack. It's also hard to find the shrimp. Shrimp is not so expensive that we need to be miserly about it. The summer roll is not bad by any stretch but it is not ideal either.\n\nNow with that complaint out of the way I cannot say enough about their fried oysters. Perfectly fried plump and juicy served with a fruity chili sauce--these little puppies will alone keep me coming back for more and more. Other things I've tried: I had the grilled beef lunch special and the flavors were exactly what I was craving in Vietnamese food. The cabbage was deliciously pickled and the fried rice was light and fluffy. Anyone who thinks a place can't do more than one type of cuisine well at the same time is missing out. An'Nam's sushi rolls are so fresh. SO FRESH!!! Their miso is a little on the sweet side for me which I don't love because miso is something I usually crave more for its salt than its sweetness but it's just the type of paste that they use. Miso varies a lot and this is just not the one I would choose out of a lineup but others might love it the most. BUT THOSE ROLLS.\n\nAlso important: speed of delivery and service. My order always arrives so quickly and the delivery person is so incredibly nice I just wanna give him a hug." u"We were starving after a Broadway show in a very rainy night. Not wanting to venture outside again after having been soaked all day long we ordered delivery from here as a last resort. Everything else was closed or pizza. \nWe got lucky! This is some of the best noodles we've had!!!\nWe ordered the Pork Gyoza (delicious) Beef Negimaki and Shrimp Shumai (succulent) as appetizers. And then the best part: Yakisoba!! It was absolutely scrumptious! \nI'll definitely order from here again!" u"Perhaps this was my delivery experience and dine in is better.\n\nI should have known that a restaurant which sells Japanese/Chinese/and Vietnamese food ALL in one can't be authentic. It tasted like poorly made Chinese food without any Vietnamese flavors at all. Beef never tastes like beef in Chinese restaurants so this is not what I was expecting ordering a Vietnamese Lemongrass Beef dish. Sadly the Thai iced tea wasn't up to par either. Oh and there was a strand of hair in the food. Fast delivery though." u"My friend and I decided to come here for dinner on a whim in the middle of the week. They are a Japanese Thai and Viet fusion restaurant so you'll definitely have a wide menu to choose from. \n\nWe were warmly greeted upon arrival. We decided to get a roll (gold metal) sashimi dinner special (19 pieces) and beef chow fun to share. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. The sashimi was nicely placed on top of ice and kept cool. Everything was very fresh and the dish even came with two scallops! The gold metal roll had a very unique taste to it. It was topped with mango and I'm not sure what other ingredients were in it but it had a slight hint of bubble tea taste to me. Either way it was very good!\n\nService was great as well. The waiters were very attentive and kept coming by to refill our waters and take away used plates. I'd definitely stop by again next time I'm around the area!" u'Friendly service from multiple servers and hostess. Well prepared  on the bland side for Vietnamese Cuisine. Light and tasty appetizers  fresh and flavorful entrees. Inexpensive for Times Square area. Will return here.' u'Place was a saving grace last night.\n\nWith under an hour before "Springsteen on Broadway" my friend and I needed a fast yet pleasurable dinner. The An\'Nam maitre d assured us dinner would arrive in a timely fashion and we wouldn\'t be disappointed. He was correct on both counts.\n\nFast menu choices included a tasty Hot and Sour Soup. Crunchy and slightly greased Pork Spring Rolls. In addition all sushi selections worked.\n\nComfortable spacious dining booth. Bill arrived quickly as well - we were never forgotten.\nTime wise perfect as we arrived as our seats at 8PM sharp.\n\nThank You.' u"Small portions on the dinner bento box - I wish they had explained that the shumai that came with it only totalled 3... but the flavors were good :)\n\nAlso the Vietnamese summer rolls didn't have all traditional ingredients but as this is right in the theater district I understand that they probably are catering to masses instead of traditional tastes. theModestly dot com has a larger unbiased review article mentioning our visit the location.\nThe service was wonderful! Looi our server was patient and helpful." u"Random choice for drinks and a quick bite.  Not disappointed.\n\nBut don't expect your Momma's cooking here.\n\nThis is a touristy theater district fusion eatery that serves honest drinks -- whose main attraction is location -- walking distance to most any Broadway show -- and next door to our theater for the evening.\n\nHappy hour is a good deal with beers at $4 and cocktails for $6.  They mix an honest Cosmo and the iced Vietnamese coffee - blend of coffee and chicory (I had it unsweetened) was refreshing. Add a shot of something for a couple more bucks if you must. ;)\n\nWe only had time for small bites -- so we ordered the Mango salad with Alaskan pollack sticks masquerading as crab meat and fried shallots.  It went down well -- spicy and sweet with that distinctive shredded mango flavor and nice texture from the fried shallots.  We also had a sashimi salad that was much less interesting -- but was dressed in a Yuzu-style dressing that made the tuna/salmon and yellowtail and greens -- pop.  \n\nPricing is reasonable and service is quick and attentive -- in tune with our need to be done in time to make our show.\n\nSometimes necessity works -- and less is more.  On this occasion -- both were true and I would do it again." u'Their pho noodle is cut all in pieces all the time. Everytime i get them. I cant even grab it with chopstick Such a tasteless' u"The dumplings are quite delicious and the pho is quite good and inexpensive. I ordered a small pho and it was only 7. We went there early so not much people were there. The waiters and waitress there can speak Chinese which I didn't expect though it is not a Chinese restaurant." u'Had takeout. The staff was friendly getting we water while I waited for my order. I think there is better Asian food in NY but it was good and in the right neighborhood.' u"Came here post theatre for a quick bite. Nice food and friendly service. The menu is extensive so there is lots of choice from curry to noodles and also the option to customize a dish for example choose a meat sauce and 4 vegetables to make a stir fry. \n\nI would recommend if you're looking to get some dinner before or after a show. Only three stars as the food was fine it filled a hole but it wasn't like 'omg this is the best food I've eaten in ages' kind of level." u"I've been here twice so far and both great experiences good service great pho there happy hour has good drinks and prices are reasonable" u'I really enjoyed being there! The staff is extremely kind place is clean food comes really fast and it is delicious!! I ordered fried rice and would eat again! Thank youuuuu' u'I had Spring rolls and Pad Thai at this place and they were really good it came with a sauce and that gave a unique flavor to it. I gave 3 starts because sushi that my friend had was not that good (for me Japanese but maybe okay for most people?) Still I was impressed with the price and quality for this area. Overall I enjoyed my food!' u'I love the variety being offered on their menu. Plenty of options from sushi to Vietnamese to Thai cuisine. The food was authentic and they take a lot of care with the plating and presentation which I appreciated. The service was excellent and staff was friendly. There were so many items we wanted to try if only we had a bigger stomach!' u"amazing place and its very well located. the prices are amazing and dont let me get started on the food. i've never had such a good red curry ever in my life. the service is immaculate you must ask for james and peggy they are the absolute b e s t!" u"The clean simple lines and soft pink lighting of An'Nam's dining room were the perfect respite after being blown around all afternoon in the top deck of a tour bus. It was late afternoon quiet...peace at last!\n\nAlso a relief when you're eating out every meal was their lunch pricing. Yelper Daughter got 3 sushi rolls for $12 I think; it was a chilly day so the $9 pho sounded good to me. YD's sushi was beautiful and she said it was good. The pho broth was rich with lots of meat basil and cilantro. Exactly what I needed. The service was fast without being rushed and our server was friendly and polite. It turned out to be a relaxing finish to a wild afternoon." u'The food was good.   We started with shrimp summer rolls. We got an eel and jalape\xf1o roll and a dragon roll. \n\nThe service could have been better.  We never got a refill of water and we seen our waiter at the end to clear our table.'],0.3818,0.133,0.867,0.0
89.Calle Dao - Bryant Park,[u"My friend and I went to Calledao for Saturday brunch. Let's just say it was awesome.\n\nThe food was very tasty and delish. We ordered several items: mixed green salad empanadas the Cuban Eggs Benedict and Maduro and Eggs with steak. I actually recommend all of the items. \n\nThe highlight of the brunch was the bottomless drink options and service. This is the first place where I've been that had numerous options for bottomless drinks that I could mix if I chose. Our server Lika was really good. She was attentive and provided great recommendations on meal and drink options. Try the guava Bellini and the caipirinhas.\n\nHighly recommend this place! Will be back!" u"Fun times.\n\nGot here early for a party of 6 to take advantage of happy hour.  Their mixology cocktails aren't in the Happy Hour menu and I would avoid sangria but a white wine and mijito went down well.  I'm a fan of happy hour food starters and had oysters.\n\nOur dinner party had a great time and the server was super nice and responsive. \n\nJust was killer" u"I'll give this place a solid 3 1/2 star. My friend recommended this place for happy hour and fusion food is one of my favorite. I was curious to see how this restaurant was going to execute that. To my disappointment but not surprised. It didn't feel chinese nor cuban. It was very americanized.\nI had the mojito which was very nice. Lots of mint and lime very well mixed.\nOxtail croquettes were ok. The meat was very well seasoned and the dough was thin.\nShrimp empanadas. These were so weird. I can't even explain the flavor but I didn't see nor taste any shrimp. It just didn't work for me. \nDeep fried pig ears. These were ok. I liked them can't say i love them.\nYuca fries these were my favorite. Crunchy on the outside but still soft on the inside. The white limery sauce was delicious. I just wish they could thick it up a bit. It was too watery but the flavor was there. \nFried plantains. I didn't care for these. There were saggy.\nCuban spring rolls - another combination that didn't work. \nPortions are tiny. Service was good." u"The food isn't exactly Cuban-Chinese it's more like Asian-Latin fusion food.  I only come here for happy hour since the prices on their regular menu are a bit too high for me.  Happy hour is until 7pm and it's at any table not just the bar area.  Cocktails are $8 and beer is $6.  Their mojitos and margaritas are pretty good pretty strong.  The happy hour appetizers are priced from $6-$10.  The portions are small so you probably need to order 2-3 portions of each if you have a group of 6 or more.  The best dishes to order are the peking style chicken wings oxtail croquettes fried yuca and fried pig ears.  The peking style chicken wings and fried yuca are my favorite dishes.  Service can get slow during the peak hours especially after 7pm." u'Group dinner on a Wed night.\nGreat for happy hour. We should have probably ordered more appetizers and less entrees. \n\nSangria delicious a couple people had mojitos and liked them. \n\nhappy hour appetizers we ordered:\n\nOysters - don\'t know the variety but didn\'t have a lot of flavor but didn\'t taste bad either\n\nFried pig ears - long thin strips - great crunch  not too tough to eat (not "chewy") sauce it came with was decent but the pig ears themselves could\'ve had a little more seasoning or something. Still worth getting!\n\nYucca fries - very good\n\nWings - very good flavorful nice touch of heat. \n\nBy the time we decided we wanted to try other happy hour apps happy hour was over. \n\nWe shared entrees:\nPaella was a good portion w a lot of seafood but could\'ve had more seasoning. \nFried pig was decent so was the chicken. Both had good portions. But I probably wouldn\'t go out of my way to order either again.' u"I love this place! I have been to this place several times in the past year and this place never ceased to amaze me. From Happy Hour to weekend brunch Calle Dao delivers top notch food and experience. \n\nFOOD: The food here is definitely 5 out of 5! I recently stopped here for a Saturday morning brunch. The Maduro and Eggs and the Pan-Fried Noodles were two delicious plates. It might be salty for some people but I felt it was a perfect blend. \n\nSERVICE: Nothing special about the service here. Very typical standard. I'd say 3 out of 5 for this category. \n\nENVIRONMENT: It's a Cuban and Chinese fusion restaurant with heavy Cuban influenced internal decor. I really like the decor here particularly all the little lights hanging in the restaurant. So I'd give it a 5 out of 5.\n\nDINNING RECOMMENDATION:  If you were to come here for dinner on a regular weekday I'd highly recommend you make a reservation since the restaurant tends to have a huge crowd. However if you were to come on the weekend no need to worry; the restaurant tends to have a smaller crowd." u'Chinese cuban is a new beast for me and I must say that I LOVE IT. \n\nIncredible service and great food during happy hour. No doubt I will be back soon.' u'This place was fantastic. I loved every minute and the food was delectable. Great ambience. Marvin was "Marv-elous".' u"Huge fan of this place! Came here for a mid-afternoon brunch on a Saturday with friends on a whim and was definitely not disappointed! The grilled chicken sandwich with avocado cilantro pickled jalapeno achiote mayo was just the right amount of spicy but was even better when lightly drizzled with the housemade sweet and spicy sauce (be sure to ask for this!). I also split the Yucca fries (a first for me) with the Calle Dao mojo sauce and tamarind ketchup both of which did not disappoint. After we asked for the check the waiter brought out flan with spicy crema sauce and some incredible maduro (sesame ice cream) all on the house! Will definitely be back soon.\n\nAnother huge plus for this place --\xa0while we didn't partake they have what looks to be a fantastic set of bottomless brunch options from mimosas to mojitos! May have to try this next time." u'Asian fusion is a term that has unfortunately come to take on a derogatory tone which saddens me to no end. Some of my favorite food has been some mix of Chinese or Filipino food with some Western influences or vice versa (see: Fung Tu Pig and Khao). Somehow Calle Dao has been spared the ominous moniker on Yelp; either way this is one of the best restaurants in the area.\n\nCalle Dao is just one of those restaurants you walk by every day on your way home from work and do a double take. Indeed the last time I came here I was seated by the open folding windows and counted the number of pedestrians who stopped to inspect the interior of the restaurant or snap a photo of the restaurant signage.\n\nDRINK (4/5)\nFood-wise and drink-wise the selection is truly a mashup of Cuban and Chinese flavors. The bar is a great place to start your night whether with coworkers or a date. The bartenders are very helpful in helping you choose the right cocktail off the drink list or to make your own. I personally prefer the Hai Chi.\n\nFOOD (4.5/5)\nFor appetizers I advocate for the oxtail croquettes because - well - oxtail. That mango chutney is an interesting pairing but brightens up the dish considerably because - well - mango. As for an entree I have gotten the lechon asado 2/3 times and both times it simply knocked me on my behind. The fried rice-style quinoa is a delight and the pork is incredibly tender and flakes off with a soft stroke of the fork. I was devastated as you can imagine when they said they ran out of it so I settled for the black rice seafood paella. The dish came in a generous quantity and the quality was pretty decent as well. However they ran out of clams and mussels (how does this happen on a Thursday?). \n\nDESSERT (5/5)\nThey did make up for these missteps by offering free desserts for all of us and it may have been the highlight of the meal. The maduro with sesame ice cream was a stunning surprise not just because I forgot how much I enjoyed sesame dessert but the combination was inspirational. They sadly also ran out of the matcha tres leches (all the more reason to go back) but the flan and matcha ice cream were not to bad either.\n\nI am glad Calle Dao continues to fill up nightly and even has a location in Chelsea (https://www.yelp.com/biz/calle-dao-chelsea-new-york) that may suit you better geographically. Come here for any occasion!' u'This place is an absolute go-to for brunch. The food is amazing and they have an extensive drink menu. I ordered a mojito and it was honestly one of the best mojitos I have ever had. Their desserts are also so unique...a must have!' u"Came here with fairly high expectations with the 4 star rating of this restaurant. Left with a 3/3.5 star impression. \n\nService is friendly the interior is cute with small teal colored chairs and wooden tables (mainly four tops). There is a bar and a larger dining area in the back. \n\nThere is a $1 oyster HH which I wasn't crazy about. There were rocky chunks in the meat. The oysters were huge but that definitely doesn't account for the quality of the food itself. \n\nI ordered a mojito which I thought was pretty weak it was very sweet and didn't taste like it had much alcohol. \n\nWe ordered fried pork dumplings (comes in 3) with soy sauce egg rolls with mushrooms and more and yucca fries. Loved the yucca fries came with BBQ sauce and a yellow sauce. Pork dumplings were okay a bit too fried in my opinion. \n\nPaella($32): the grain in this plate is a black sort of barley grain. It comes with sliced octopus clams mussels. It was good. \n\nPeking chicken: comes with eggplant I loved the rice it came with it. This was my favorite dish. The Peking chicken is fried perfectly very crunchy and it had a sweet sauce with it. \n\nSkirt steak: comes with black beans rice. The steak was a bit cold. Other than that it was fine. \n\nWe got matcha tres leches which was really good! The cake was thick not as milky/liquidy as I've seen traditional tres leches. But still good. Comes with a caramel glaze and a thicker whipped cream. \n\nThe sesame ice cream has literal sesame seeds in them and comes with caramelized plantains. This was good I'd recommend if someone actually likes plantains more. \n\nOverall I think this place is overrated." u"I finally tried Calle Dao one Tuesday night. Two of my friends and I came in for our 6:30 reservation. They have happy hour from 4-7 ($8 glasses of house white red or rose and select cocktails) which is valid at the table as well.\n\nTo start we had some happy hour $1 oysters and clams. These were pretty basic. The oysters were pretty tiny. We also ordered the Cuban sliders (2 per order) which I loved. Instead of buns they used fried plantains which was a unique spin. I normally don't even like plantains but I liked them with these sammies. \n\nFor mains we decided to order two entrees and share. It was more than enough for three people with leftovers. I think the dishes are meant for sharing anyway similar to Chinese-style dinners. We had the Peking-Style Half Chicken in Banana Leaves (braised chinese eggplant parsley rice tomate de \xe1rbol-parsley sauce). The chicken was a bit on the dry side but the parsley rice was great. It had a lot of flavor yet the parsley wasn't overbearing as it easily can be. Next we had the Black Rice Seafood Paella (top neck clams shrimp mussels calamari\nchorizobeets daikon radish chimichurri-sofrito sauce). The chorizo that's mentioned is actually Chinese sausage. I didn't even know there was sausage in there so it was a nice surprise for me. They give a pretty generous amount of seafood too.\n\nUsually I'm pretty iffy about fusion places because they're not really fusion. They're more than likely just one restaurant serving two different types of cuisines. But Calle Dao did a great job in taking two very different cultures and meshing them together. I'll definitely be back for some more Cuban sliders and to try some of their ceviche and skirt steak.\n\nTip - it seems like they like to use a lot of cilantro and/or ginger so if you hate either of these you may not like Calle Dao." u'Came there for a dinner. Quick sitting down and good atmosphere. But to be honest the food was not as good as I expected. Ordered the goat neck which was great and the roasted Peking style chicken - not very flavorful. The oxtail appetizer was just so so. Might come again to checkout their brunch.' u'Lovee their food and especially their happy hour specials! I ordered from them before on seamless and enjoyed their entree. \n\nThey have happy hour from 4-7 on the weekdays where they have strong and delicious cocktails such as caphirinias mojitos sangrias etc for like $8 as well as a variety of beers and wines. My friend and I split a bunch of appetizers including happy hour $1 oysters oxtail croquettes goat sliders and tuna ceviche. Everything was fantastic and our favorite dish was the oxtail croquettes! They are on the small side but they have so much flavor and were complemented well with the mangos on the side.\n\nWe finished off the meal with two desserts - the matcha tre leches and flan. The flan was a little too sweet but the tre leches was made really well. The cream and matcha was awesome! We definitely were very full after these two dishes. \n\nFinally the service was great and very friendly! Definitely would come back again for their amazing happy hour and food.' u"Utterly delicious. Just a whole evening of splendid experimentation in fusion food. Chinese food with Cuban characteristics is not something I would think of and in a gorgeous ambiance and lovely music it delivers aplenty. The octopus appetizer (delicious soft and spicy)  the spiced goat neck (bone suckling good) and the whimsy in the cocktails and experience overall capped a really lovely day in NYC. I have somewhere to come back to now.\n\nP. S. Get the matcha tres leches. It's sublime." u'Fantastic place! Went for lunch when in the city and it had plenty of seating on a weekday lunch hour. Service was great and fast. Menu has some Cuban and some Chinese and some dishes inspired by both. Got the Cubans sandwich with a soup and both had great flavor. Tasted very authentic and came out piping hot. Would definitely go back! Everything is very unique and unlike any other menu I had seen!' u"I usually don't eat in Midtown but I was finishing up a work event nearby and my colleagues and I found this place via Yelp.  I'd never had Chinese-Cuban fusion before but it's delicious.\n\nWe went for brunch and I had the eggs Benedict.  It comes with fried fish instead of a meat which was unusual but the flavors blended together well.  It had a very salty sauce as a garnish but it tasted appropriate.  Had to put some hot sauce on it as is my wont.  Service was good--unobtrusive with frequent water refills.\n\nPrices for brunch are comparable for other moderate-to-upscale brunches so I didn't find it egregiously priced given the location." u"This place is absolutely amazing! Marvin's probably the coolest guy. This is my go to brunch spot... cause Marvin can get it." u'stopped in here for happy hour with a friend. drink and food specials go from 4- 7pm and feature $8 cocktails wine and sangria. we met there around 6pm and the front area where the bar is located was packed. the host took us to the larger dining area in the back which wasnt as full and seated us. you are allowed to participate in happy hour with a server which was great! the restaurant also quickly filled up. \n\nwe tried sangria and mojitos both very refreshing and tasty. we also ordered some of the happy hour apps- the goat sliders shrimp empanadas and yucca fries. this was my first time eating goat and it tasted like a gamey burger. the shrimp empanadas were our fave really tasty with a yummy sauce. the yucca fries were also good. watch out for the garlic sauce its pungent! \n\ni definitely want to come back here and get dinner. all of the entrees coming out looked delicious and filling. the atmosphere was fun playing great music and keeping our drinks full!'],0.8588,0.513,0.487,0.0
36.Melt Shop,[u"My office building is right across the Melt Shop which is pretty much a blessing if I must say but also the greatest temptation. I went at prime time around noon. The line got extremely long if you go any later than 12:00. But trust me the wait is extremely short.\n\nThe food ordered:\n(1) Truffle Melt with fried chicken: (5/5)\nThe whole sandwich just melts in your mouth. The amount of chicken is packed in there makes it so much harder to finish in one setting. The truffle oil taste isn't too strong that you can't taste the chicken which is perfect. I usually save half the sandwich to eat later in the day unless you want a food coma.\n\n(2) Tomato Soup: (3/5) \nGreat addition to the meal but not neccessary. It's just a classic to always have melted cheese with tomato soup.\n\n(3) Cheesy tots: (5/5)\nThe tots hit the spot! its always such a big debate whether to get the house tots or the cheesy tots but when in doubt try the cheese tots." u"In the mood for grilled cheese? Both classic version and the adult version with chicken bacon or extra add-ons? They have more than one location in the city and this is the second location I visited besides the one outside of grand central.\n\nI'm a fan of grilled cheese so every so often I would crave it. The classic simple american cheese and then if I'm extra hungry I would want one with extra add-ons. (ie: meat veggies or extra cheese)\n\nI was in the area with my boyfriend and were baby sitting his niece and nephew. So what's something the kids would eat that we would like as well than grilled cheese. They have a kids set thats come with a classic grilled cheese tater tots and an apple juice box. The kids also wanted a chocolate milkshake. They were very accomodating. I didn't want to order a milkshake for each of the kids because it might be too much and it'll be a waste if they don't finish it. The counter person offered to have one order split into two cups.\n\nFor my boyfriend he wanted the maple bacon and the fried chicken grilled cheese with a side of regular tater tots. As for myself I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese with a side of parmesan tots and side of cheese sauce. Have you figured that I love cheese yet?\n\nThe buffalo chicken grilled cheese was good but it felt like it was lacking. My buffalo chicken was a bit dry. Probably needs more buffalo sauce or extra bleu cheese dipping sauce. My boyfriend said the maple bacon was alright tasted like regular bacon. He said the fried chicken grilled cheese was good.\n\nI might just stick with a classic grilled cheese from this spot. Tots were good no complaints. I forgot to mention I got myself a cookies and cream milkshake and that was a win! Kids loved it so this is also a good spot for them.\n\nThis place isn't bad. But if you're willing to commute there's a better grilled cheese spot that I frequent; Cheese Grille down in LES would be my go to spot. But at the moment I was in midtown west and melt was there.\n\nService at this location was good too! 3.5 stars! Will come here for the convenience when I'm near any of their locations." u"I love tater tots. \n\nThis place has them and they serve them numerous ways. \n\nThe sandwiches are good too. \n\nTreat yo'self!" u"Came here because I didn't want to eat at a chain restaurant while at Times Square. I pulled up my Yelp app and this place was probably in the top 10 given my location.\n\nWhen I arrived here for a late lunch around 3pm there was nobody in line. The menu was pretty extensive for a grilled cheese place. It took me about 5-6 minutes to properly study the menu.\n\nI decided to order:\n1. Basic grilled cheese with chicken (~$8)\n2. Side salad (~$4)\n\nFor around ~$12 I definitely had enough food for a late lunch. I was already full from my grilled cheese. I didn't need tots or a side salad. The side salad was a mini to go box of arugula and shredded carrots with some dressing. Nothing amazing. For something as simple as a grilled cheese sandwich it took awhile before I received my order. It was literally a grilled cheese sandwich with a fried chicken cutlet in between the cheese and bread. It was tasty but nothing mind-blowing. \n\nProps for the nice service cleanliness and relatively cheap prices. There were also plenty of seats and tables to eat at if you choose to eat in." u'Was in NY for the weekend and was looking for a bite to eat for lunch and saw this place and wanted to check it out! I got their tomato soup which was exceptional and I got the Classic Grilled Cheese and also the another Classic but with a burger patty. My wife and I shared them and they were very good. \nYou can tell once you bite in to your sandwich they use fresh ingredients.' u'Fantastic sandwich shop in the heart of Midtown! I had heard about this place from several friends when I was considering what to order for lunch the other day. I ordered via Grubhub and got: Grilled Chicken Sandwich Tomato Soup and Shop Tots. \n\nAll of the food was delicious! The sandwich was just the right size the soup was a nice consistency (not too thick and not too thin) and the tots were on point! They paired nicely with the Shop Sauce. \n\nFor a Midtown restaurant Melt Shop is decently priced and has great food. It will become a favourite of mine :)' u"When I go to a place that claims to specialize in grilled cheese and order a grilled cheese is it wrong of me to expect more than one slice of cheese in the sandwich? The base grilled cheese was definitely not up to NY grilled cheese standards and the variants with bacon + extras did not impress me any more. The cheese was good and the bread was decent but I dream of grilled cheese where the melted cheese is overflowing from the bread's futile efforts to keep it in your hands.\n\nThe tots were good but don't make up for the lackluster sandwich." u'Hands down one of my favorite places to stop at in all of NYC. The wife and I trekked here and were enamored with the menu. I decided to have the Burger Melt and absolutely loved it! It was thick and gooey and rich and...well it was just amazing! Definitely one of the most unique and delicious melts I have ever had. I also appreciated that they offered a few local beers to choose from which accompanied such a wonderful melt beautifully. \n\nA must try for anyone in NYC!' u"This is a random find. Me & my friends were walking around the area & we just feel hungry then this place is right across the street so we decided to give it a try. We went close to 2pm & its empty. The place is simple & clean. \n\nI got maple bacon for myself- it has cheddar brick spread & maple glaze bacon. Omg! Its perfectly toast melty cheese & bacon. The salty & sweet taste is perfect. Its a wow in every bite! My friend got the buffalo blue- its fries chicken pepper jack buffalo & blue cheese. She really enjoyed her food. Crispy chicken & very tasty! I got soda for mg drink & they gave me a cup to get it myself. Its a self service restaurant. \n\nWe're so full & satisfied! It was a great place for grilled sandwiches. Each piece is huge!!" u"When I'm craving for a good grilled cheese sandwich I go to Melt Shop.  They serve a variety of kicked up grilled sandwiches with a variety of cheese their main side is tater tots it's alright sprinkled with parmesan cheese... nothing great but I got buffalo cheese dip to add more kick. \nI adore the Maple Bacon with the sweet and savory ooey goodness it is delicious. You can't go wrong with the Classic and 3 Cheese. \n\nThe Tomato Soup is tasty I wish it was a little thicker but it is surely satisfying. Wash it down with their ice cream shakes! Can it get any better?  You want a reliable & filling meal this is a good place to go!  4 stars!" u"I was looking for someplace nearby to grab a bite after work. This place showed up on yelp as somewhere nearby with some decent reviews and for some reason I was craving some tasty fried chicken. \n\nI ordered the chicken sandwich (apparently the most popular) loaded tots and a side salad. The tots were pretty much as you'd expect ... loaded with cheese and bacon.  Salad was plain. The fried chicken sandwich was just ok. It was a bit messy as the purple cabbage was dripping a bit and there really wasn't much crisp flavor or gooey cheese. Personally it'd be better if there was more spice in my opinion. \n\nOverall for being near times square it was decently priced for the amount you get." u'Had the truffle melt with caramelized onion. Absolutely loved it. The truffle shake was also good and so was the cheesy tots. Will def visit again.' u'I loved melt shop I still love their nutella shake. However everything has change no sourdough bread I order the buffalo chicken and it was different and the chicken was not the same quality  as the first classic one i had. I Dont know why they change the menu Everything was delicious before. :/' u'Now it is very important to remember the Yelp rating system and what the different star levels mean. A-ok is not necessarily a bad rating. This place was the perfect surprise of quality food that I needed in the moment. There may never be another moment where I "need" this.\n\nTrying to burn some time before Fallon. Looking for a quick bite and we found it. We ordered the maple bacon grilled cheese some tomato soup and there cheesy tots.\n\nOn looks alone... this place would have been lucky to score a two but thankfully I still bit into the grilled cheese sandwich and whoa mama!. A nice burst of maple syrup (at least I am telling myself it was maple) and cheese. For those of you who don\'t know me sweet and savory is my jam (not really intended to be a pun but it kind of works). \n\nThe saltiness of the cheese the butter on the bread and the savory bacon all were delicious on their own but kicked up two notches with the heavenly elixir that is syrup. I gobbled that bad boy up real quick. And this was the true star of the dish.\n\nTomato soup... if you watch arrested development it reminded me of Anne. Her. Just there nothing special.\n\nThe tots were good melt in your mouth the cheese stuff on top was weird I am not sure what type of cheese it was trying to be but they were pretty alright I guess. I don\'t know... didn\'t get it.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nGreat place to drop by if you need a quick bite. This isn\'t a go out of your way place and this definitely is just a place for the grilled cheese. I repeat do not get anything else. The grilled cheese are fun and tasty. So do what any self-respecting person would do and eat way too much.' u"Ohh I had super high expectations from this place. I LOVVE cheese and I also LOVE tater tots. I decided to try the truffle melt sandwich and the cheesy tots. The tater tots were pretty crispy until about half way through. Not sure if it was too heavy but couldn't finish these even though I shared it with my husband. The truffle melt sandwich was just ok. The cheese inside wasn't gooey or pulled like most do. The truffle flavour was very minimal and the arugula was a pretty good addition. I liked how crispy the sandwich was but again didn't finish even half a slice. It was just way too salty." u'Called ahead to ask about how they prepare gluten free sandwiches on the gluten free bread. Spoke to a staff member that explained that they put the sandwiches inside foil when they put it in the oven to prevent cross contamination and that they\'re prepared separately and was reassured that they\'ve never had a problem. My issue when people tell me this is....would you be honest with me if you actually DID have a problem before?\n\nAfter speaking with the woman on the phone I told her that I\'d be in the store in about 15 minutes to get lunch. Arrived before the lunch rush placed my order and left with my "gluten free" lunch. About 3 bites into my sandwich I realized they had put the wrong sandwich in my bag and it was NOT gluten free!!!! I quickly went back to the store where they casually explained that I grabbed the wrong order (I didn\'t). I told her that the rest of my order was correct to which she responded that someone else must have ordered the same thing with a different sandwich (they didn\'t). I intentionally went before the rush and find it hard to believe that out of the 5 people in the restaurant at the time someone else also ordered a sandwich loaded tater tots and a strawberry milkshake. When I pointed this out she awkwardly realized that her excuse didn\'t really seem likely or true and got a manager. The manager came over and insisted that I grabbed someone else\'s to-go bag which was why I had the wrong sandwich to which I responded that my bag had my name and receipt attached to it. \n\nI was very calm throughout this ordeal because I worked in the food service industry for several years...but I also know how seriously I took food allergies even before I became allergic to gluten. The manager was apologetic but didn\'t quite grasp the severity of the error. He seemed very proud of himself for re-making my meal and refunding my money. Sure it was a nice gesture but I lost my appetite after eating the first sandwich and wouldn\'t trust them a second time to not screw up. It definitely was not worth the hassle as I ended up throwing up outside of my client\'s office had to leave work early and had residual illness for a week after. \n\nI am curious though the next time someone calls up and asks about gluten free sandwiches will they tell people they\'ve had an issue before? Doubt it.' u"I don't often eat roast beef sandwiches but the French Onion Beef was calling my name. It was delicious! I don't even like sherry vinaigrette either but somehow it really made this sandwich special. The arugula gave it a nice peppery kick as well. I had the tots with cheese but was a little disappointed in those. They would've been better without the cheese. I saw some tots on other tables that looked like they had parmesan instead and they looked so much better. The cheese made the tots a little soggy so I wouldn't get those again. My husband really enjoyed his burger melt although I felt like it needed thicker bread to hold up such a heavy sandwich. So not quite 5 stars in my book but still enjoyable overall. I was impressed by how efficient and fast the service was as well. The long line moved very quickly and we didn't have to wait very long for our food." u"As other people have said this is nothing gourmet or fancy. It's grilled cheese made in a hurry. They have lots of options with a variety of fillings. The classic grilled cheese is just that....cheese inside bread. The maple bacon sandwich was good but the included Brick cheese has a little bit of a footy flavor so if that's not your jam just beware. \n\nMilkshake looked good but probably a base of vanilla with other flavors mixed in. \n\nTots are always great -- cheesy tots just have cheese sauce dumped on the top (still good not complaining but nothing fancy).\n\nI'd come back again for a quick lunch but if you're looking for a top of the line gourmet sandwich this is probably not the place." u"Just ate here on the recommendation of reviewers here and I'm glad that I did.  The Truffle Melt was amazing!  The tots were just okay.  But definitely get the sandwich (pictures here)." u"To rate anything above 3 stars feels like an inside job.  I'm not saying it's bad but pull the curtain back this place isn't selling anything you haven't done in your younger let's say more creative days (think 3AM eats/munchies).   Tater tots - check.  Cheese covered stuff grilled between two pieces of bread - check.  Relaxed setting - check.\n\nWould fine be for what it is but calling this place a 4 star revelation would be to get excited because you've stumbled across the Doritos Los taco burrito it Taco Bell....  there is nothing here you can't do and possibly better at home..."],0.8573,0.207,0.793,0.0
82.Havana Social,[u'I don\'t usually do this but let\'s start with the problems.  Havana Social is small.  The space is utilitarian not hip and cool but warm and friendly.  So if the aesthetic is more or as important to you as the food then you won\'t be happy here.  If however food is what you are after- really good Cuban food then you\'ve come to right spot.  Having had the good fortune to travel to Cuba I would say that this food is aspirational for Cuba.  Poor Cuba doesn\'t have access to professional culinary tools nor does it have the ability to purchase the freshest of seasonings or produce but Havana Social does and wow does it ever show.\n\nA party of six of us went for brunch this weekend and it was one of the best brunches I\'ve had in my life.  I had the Colombia Plate for breakfast. Before my brunch even arrived a complimentary chips and guacamole appeared.  I was able to score two chips and a bit of guacamole before the whole plate was devoured to purrs of "this is the best guacamole I\'ve ever had.  After the guacamole disappeared two perfectly poached eggs sat atop smoked salmon (there was also slow roasted pork but I had it removed as I don\'t eat anything with four legs- long story) some greens and a thin slice of tomato. Perfectly cooked beans and fluffy rice arrived on a separate plate.  Juevos Rancheros were presented beautiful and loaded with avocado.   The food was just excellent.   \n\nTo be completely transparent I am from California.  I\'ve come to NYC a bunch of times.  I have lived in Boston and Washington D.C. NYC your restaurants are unbelievable.  Los Angeles doesn\'t have great restaurants on every corner.  I do believe though based on our access to fresh produce and our proximity to Mexico- we kill it in the Latin Food Department.  Trust me.  Havana Social belongs in Los Angeles.  Please come.  You have an open invitation and a public hungry awaiting your restaurant. \n\nNow the food is muy excellente and the staff (Grace this means you) are just so lovely.  We were celebrating a special occasion and Grace called me to have a photo of the celebrator\'s face put on the menu along with a personal note to him.  The honoree was so happily surprised and well honored.  Grace had all of us sign the menu and laminated that menu as a keepsake.  Wait I\'m going to keep going.  Along with this beautiful laminated menu Grace included a coupon for 20.00 for the next visit (which trust me will be used).  Finally at the end of the meal a special dessert with a sparkler was presented to the table.  I have never experienced such heartfelt and kind touches pushing Havana Social way to the top of my list of favorites.' u"The place is small so coming here for dinner as a party of 5 did feel a little crammed. It was busy on a Friday night and the service wasn't great. For example we ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table but had to remind the waitress a few times before it came out. Also given odd number of 5 in our party we were sat at a table meant for 4. Once the table opened up next to us the waitress did not combine the table and I had to move it myself.\n\nThe food was tasty but very pricy for the serving size. We ordered a bunch of tapas versus normal entrees. A filling meal with a few glasses of sangria came out to $80 per person. My favorites of the tapas were the pork belly buns and the octopus. I've had calamari before but never octopus and this was a great introduction. Great texture and cooked perfectly. The pork in the pork belly buns were melt in your mouth fantastic. \n\nI like the food and may be back. However don't recommend if you are in a semi-large group." u"I had such high hopes for this place. A group of 12 of us came here for a birthday dinner with a reservation for 9:30 p.m. While I know that some things are not in control of a restaurant like people not leaving on time they should at least implement a strict policy of a 2-hour stay especially because the place is tiny and especially if there is a large party coming. We got accommodated around 10:30 p.m. and it was a very cold night and the place inside was cramped so every time people had to leave we had to move. Again not completely the restaurant's fault. \n\nOne of the perks I loved though is that they were able to print the birthday boy's picture onto the menu we all had a good laugh! \n\nNow the very thing that irked me most: I knew that the menu was prix fixe and came with prior knowledge that it would be $36 for a two-course meal. The menu we received said $45 for three-courses so I thought that they changed their prix fixe menu. When we got the check though it was actually a two-course prix fixe for $36 plus an optional $9 for dessert. No staff member told us that dessert was optional especially since the menu clearly stated the $45 price. It would have been nice to know and personally I would not have gotten dessert. \n\nThe appetizer and entree were good but my dessert was disappointing. I ordered the chocolate lava cake and the chocolate cake wasn't warm nor did it have any melted chocolate inside. Definitely would not have paid an extra $9 for it wasn't worth. 20% automatic gratuity added sucks but can't avoid that.\n\nThe place did have good service and accommodated any other problems that came up but it really just wasn't up to par from what I read from the reviews." u"Trendy intimate bar for a drink. But - then it stops. While my service was perfectly friendly - it was just soooo slow so don't be in a rush to just have a drink before dinner somewhere here. \n\nBut - this is one of the few Latin and non-Spaniard focused places in Midtown w/o heading to Queens or Harlem. \n\nThings to Note on the Food:\n1) Absolutely pass on the Paella - ehh\n2) Bacalou Fried Fritters were awesome!\n3) Focus on Apps vs. Mains to share \n4) Lots of fusion stuff going on and I don't know if I love that. And Asian Latin food is a real thing but I don't know about the execution here\n5) Love the Arepas and beef empanadas\n6) ceviche is good but not great\n\nOverall - it was a great experience but not my consistent local hole for my Latin weekly needs." u"This was one of the top 5 meals I've ever had!!!! And I eat A LOT!! Came to NY for a taping of the daily show and wanted to find a close restaurant to enjoy before the ride back to Baltimore. Found this gem on Yelp and I'm soooooo glad I did. 5 stars ALL THE WAY!!!\n\nAfter making reservations I got a call mid day the day of to ask if we were celebrating anything special that evening. I let them know it was a friend's bday and just like the other reviews noted they go above and beyond!! They asked me to email a picture so they could make a personalized pre fixe menu - which turned out adorable! After we ordered they told us to sign one as a keep sake and they would laminate it. At the end of the dinner they brought it out in a full sized envelope with a $20 gift certificate to come back in a year. I mean if that's not going the extra mile - I don't know what is?!?!\n\nThe service was obviously impeccable and the ambiance was super cute with a definite Cuban flare. \n\nBut this FOOD!!!! This food was out of this world. Every bite was better than last.  Hands down the best Cuban food I've ever had...and arguably one of the best meals ever too. Started with the complimentary chips and bean sauce. Solid solid start. \n\nI ordered the sampler (mixta) of empanadas (chicken) arepas (garlic butter shrimp) and alitas (sweet and spicy wings). The chicken empanadas were formidable and worth the get. I don't do beef or pork - hence the chicken. But these wings were mind blowing. The sauce was the perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. PLEASE get these!! And the arepas - THE AREPAS!!! Which were sweet corn cakes with garlic butter shrimp...was without a doubt the single best dish of the night (but I'm told the beef ones were equally as amazing). If you don't get these I'm not even sure why you came!! \n\nI know this line of getting old by now but the sweet plantains were the best plantains I've ever had too. With a hint of cinnamon and caramelized sugar...goodness were they fantastic. I also tried the yuca fritas which were like big garlic French fries....YUM!!!! \n\nFor the birthday celebration they also bring a plate of three small pieces of guava tres leches. GEEZ what a way to close out this meal. Simply divine!!! There happened to be 3 of us there so it was perfect. I really can't say enough about this place. Only that's it's 2:45 in the morning I just got finished driving over 4 hours...and I couldn't go to bed without writing this review. So yeah go here." u"I had my birthday celebration here a few days ago and this is the place to be. Havana Social truly makes you feel special on your special day. Note: If you have a party of 7 or more make reservations ahead of time. You have to pay a $15 per person deposit though for a time before 9:30PM which will go toward your dinner. I understood why when I realized how small the place is. Anyways I got here an hour late but they were still able to seat me shortly afterwards.\n\nAs mentioned by other reviewers they create a customized birthday menu with a picture you send in. At the end your friends can sign it as if it were a card and then they laminate it for you to bring home. Super adorable concept! The food and drinks here were delicious but the service was even better. The appetizer that stood out to me most was the arepas dulce. You can't go wrong with the guac beef empanadas and paella either! They provided my whole party with free signature shots and dessert with a sparkler! Then they even gave me another glass of champagne. I can't thank them enough for a great 23rd! \n\nWith my personalized menu they also included a $20 gift certificate for the next time I come here. Trust me I can't recommend Havana enough and will definitely be back." u"This is the place to be for a classy and sassy birthday dinner! The staff go above and beyond to make sure the birthday person has a lit celebration. For starters they printed a customized Birthday Menu with the Birthday person's photo on it....Free birthday cake ...To top off the night complimentary shots for our everyone\n\nAdditionally the staff was very accommodating. Even though we arrived 30 minutes after our reservation and had an additional 2 guests they were able to seat us.  \n\nA couple things to note: Make reservations for a party of 4 or more as seating is limited. If you have a big dinner party the wait time for food may be longer as they aim to bring the food out all at the same time. \n\nOverall we loved it here. You will too. I highly recommend coming to this establishment for a birthday dinner" u'What a great place to grab some small plates. Stopped here for a date night with my boyfriend on our last night in NYC. We were very pleased with the staff and the food. The salsa was so good I wanted to take some home! Not too spicy at all and just wonderful flavors. We ended up trying an order of the empanadas and they were delicious! We then had the ceviche which was also very flavorful. I recommend getting the rum punch if you are looking for a delicious drink with your meal! \n\nIf you are in the mood for something different and a great place for a date this is the spot. I believe our check was around 60 dollars for two drinks and two small plates. Well worth the money! Very intimate setting and a great staff!' u"Havana Social is an ideal place to celebrate a special occasion -- I came here for a friend's birthday and the food and service were great. We had a few changes to the number of people in our party and the wait staff were super accommodating in taking out a table and then having to add it back later.\n\nIt's been mentioned in a few other reviews but this place really tries to make a birthday feel special. They'll ask you for a picture and make a customized menu that gets signed as a birthday card and laminated. The dessert comes with a sparkler and after dessert they bring out shots on the house.\n\nOnto the food -- the chips and bean dip that come as a starter were great. Costillitas (pork ribs yuca fries salad) and garlic shrimp were delicious. I would maybe skip the empanadas and chino latino (Asian-style pork belly buns with chipotle aioli) next time not because they weren't good but because they were nothing special being the kinds of dishes that are a dime a dozen at a hundred other places and hard to mess up. The mango margs were good and come rimmed with chili salt. Paella was very good as well.\n\nCan't speak to what the ambiance is like on a weekend but on a Tuesday night the place is full but the tables don't turn over very often; it's a relaxed and intimate vibe." u'Came here before a concert based on a Yelp review and proximity to my hotel. The food was GREAT & SERVICE was awesome . Had the Ramen soup and it was amazing.' u"Stopped here for a quick bite and we were pleasantly surprised. It was dead inside and we were the only couple sitting at the bar. We shared the appetizer trio.  It came with empanadas - lobster mac and cheese and beef polenta with pulled pork and ribs. All of the them were out of this world! The drinks were amazing too! We had a mojito that had a nice garnish of sugar cane and the coquito.  The coquito was delicious but really is an after dinner drink. Our bartender was an idiot and that's why I am knocking a star. Even though we were his only customer it was like he could care a less. Great spot for good food. I'll go back." u"This is THE place to celebrate your/your special one's birthday. Their customer service is excellent and they make sure you feel extra special on your birthday with complementary dessert and shots (seriously wasn't expecting that). On top of that they print your photos on the menu which was super awesome.\n\nI had to change my reservation time at last minute and they were very accommodating about it. The food is great as well. I had the special cuban bento box (interesting!) which came with standard rice and beans and green salad chicken and plantains. It was a lot of food and I couldn't finish it." u"OH MAN OH MAN! This place is banging! Love the d\xe9cor food and service here!  \n\nHere is what we ordered: \nCoconut mojito - Get the pitcher 5/5\nShrimp Ceviche - Don't forget to order a side of fresh chips 3/5\nTaquitos - Carnitas crispy tiny tacos - made with love 10/10 - GET THIS\nApapas Dulce - Sweet corn cakes with garlic butter shrimp 5/5\nLobster Mac and Cheese empanadas - enough said 5/5\n\nIf lived in NY I would dine here all the time. It's a little bit pricey and it's tapas portions so its tiny but the quality and flavor is exceptional. This is actually one of my favorite meals when I visited NY." u'This place is delicious we fell upon it due to it being so close to our hotel we were not disappointed.  We hat the white bean puree with fresh chips (the chips are amazing) the empanadas mixta arepas dulce ropa vieja with to stones maduros rice and beans we also had the mofongito which was amazing the patatas bravas are a reminder of barcelona....if you are in the area you must try this restaurant!!' u'Super cute place! Lavish bar set up with blue lights. My friend and I came for happy hours and ordered a pitcher of strawberry capirinhas as recommended by the bartender. They were delicious! Only pitfall is that the muddled strawberries would settle a little so if you were to get yourself a drank be sure to mix it a little. But like I said they were delicious and strong a pitcher at happy hour is 35$ they also have 8$ drinks but come on you know you want a pitcher. \n\nWe also got an empanada sampler which was delicious! I originally wanted it because of the lobster Mac and cheese empanada but that one was surprisingly underwhelming. It was still good though! My favorite was the beef and the spinach empanadas though. \n\nDefinitely hit this place up for happy hour! 4-7pm!' u'Food was tasty free coquito shot at the end for your bday Caribbean rum punch was great - unfortunately they just lost a star for the service. About 3 different people were serving us and they were confusing each other & plates were taken away before food was finished.. felt a little rushed. But nice dinner overall.' u"I stumbled upon this place by accident while looking for another restaurant recommended by the fabulous 414 boutique hotel. I had a Cuban Bento box and flan for desert with coconut ice cream.  \n\nSo delicious i ended up finishing dinner at 11 PM. I never do that. it's the expressway to obese. \n\n I have pictures." u"Yo. No BS. Had one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC here and it was for a large group birthday dinner (which is usually a disaster). \n\nThese folks went above and beyond from start to finish. When I booked the table for 14 guests I let them know I wanted to have a special night for my husband. They had me send them a picture and they had each menu printed with his photo for all the guests. \n\nThe food was soooo good. The whole table was raving about the pre-fixe menu and the bocaditos. Heavy shout out to the empanadas and honey wings. Everyone loved the nice touch of the bean dip and tortilla chips. Omg the cubanito stop lives in my dreams - delicious. All of this was made even better by our amazing server who was high energy and all smiles the whole night. \n\nThey brought out the cake we brought with a sparkler and even cut it and served it for the table. At the end of the night they gave the table a free round of coquito shots such a cute touch. \n\nThey even had everyone sign a copy of the menu and laminated it to be taken home by the birthday boy. He had an absolute blast and the squad is still raving. \n\nIn short y'all did that." u"Spent the weekend in NYC with my boyfriend for our anniversary and found this place on yelp around the corner from our Airbnb! The reviews were absolutely accurate! Delicious cocktails; the 1 hour unlimited cocktail special is an excellent deal (especially if you need to recover from the previous night)!  Empanadas were delicious fresh ceviche guacamole & homemade chips were a perfect/filling lunch! It's a bit small but we hope to celebrate an occasion soon based on the reviews about the service for parties and birthdays! We will be back!" u'Great atmosphere and food.\nWe were there for dinner. Had two tapas dishes: guacamole with fries which was delicious and also mac and cheese with shrimps bacon and chorizo . This dish is a MUST! Super yummy! \n\nFor the main course we ordered:" Mar y Tierra" - chipotle pork chop garlic butter shrimp mash potato puree sauteed spinach.\nThis dish was huge and do delicious! The pork was cooked and seasoned to perfection the potato puree was amazing with the garlic shrimps on top and it also came with fried plantains which made this dish just perfect!!!! \n\nWe had a great time and we enjoyed the food so much. Authentic Cuban experience the music was so pleasant and the service was great. \nThe only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was too hot inside. \n\nBut overall we recommand this place for lunch or a nice dinner :)'],0.4215,0.203,0.797,0.0
187.Dannys Gourmet Deli,[u"So for what it is I like it. Its a. CHEAP b. QUICK c. CHEAP and d. TASTY which is a hard combination to find in Times Square. It wasn't crowded even on a Friday night over the holidays. There is plenty of seating upstairs. Yes its not the cleanest (some tables have stains and the bathrooms have graffiti all over the walls) but theres TONS of seating (no worries getting a seat and free bathrooms. No one is checking so if you need a quick free bathroom in the area come here and go straight upstairs. \n\nI got a classic deli sandwich pastrami and swiss on rye. It came out quick hot and good. I sat down. I come here after trying to get rush tickets for musicals and have time to kill." u'We bought some chicken wings and found Hayes in 5 of the pieces. Not buying copied food here again' u"I'm giving 5 stars only because I used to be the hot food buffet chef there about 5 1/2 years ago. The owner was very good to me even though I was inexperienced before I went to culinary school. If it wasn't for this job I would've never pursued cooking as a career. I got to see Floyd Mayweather and Rampage Jackson when they stayed at The W hotel next door." u'Saw bad reviews but at 1am I was craving a pastrami sandwich and they were next door to the hotel. \nI walked in went to the deli counter. The "cook" was slumped over the steam pan. I loudly cleared my throat several times to no avail. Finally I loudly asked if they were open.\nHe looked up and nodded.\n"I would like a pastrami sandwich" I said.\nHe shook his head and waved his hand at the flat top full of frying bacon and said "no the flat top is full" and put his head back down.\nHow this place is open is beyond me. \nAvoid like the plague.' u'Pretty good little deli in the area if you work in midtown. I recommend the Italian sandwich.' u"Grabbed a sandwich and ended up in the hospital with food poisoning. Do not eat here!!! Went back to tell them & they didn't care" u'I was visiting the area in Times Square. I like simple delis. I would go around 9am on weekdays. It was a good sign to me that a number of local construction workers were ordering their breakfasts. I enjoy the bagels there toasted with cream cheese. All are very good. Everything that was being cooked on the griddle looked excellent too. The coffee is very food too. I could get two bagels with cream cheese and two coffees for just a little more than I would pay for a latte at a major coffee shop named after a character in a classic novel about a whale.' u"This is a really bad choice. It's not a bad food presentation at the food island but the cook's line is a mess. The cooks stumble over each other as they fail to have a good system for taking orders and getting out the food. Meanwhile the impatient guests argue with the cooks trying to straighten them out on what they ordered and the pancakes and bacon sitting in trays under heat lamps get old and very very dry. The owners are stingy with condiments and give only one tiny pat of butter and one small container of syrup that are impossible to cover their three dry pancakes. Their cashier is obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and hoof it to McDonald's around the corner for better product and service!" u'I always had my doubts about this place but got a salad today anyway.  FAIL.  I found a stick in my salad!  Like a wood branch soaked in dressing!  I have never experienced anything like this in my life.  Trust your gut and go elsewhere.' u"Walked in for a quick bite before a show across the street. There was one person on line ahead of us. The guy behind the counter took that person's order and then proceeded to make it. Then another girl walked in and stared talking to the guy behind the counter. Instead of taking our order he ignored us. Did not even greet us and asked the girl what she wanted and proceeded to make her order. During this process he did not even acknowledge we were there and another person walked in. By this time more than 10 minutes had gone by and we didn't feel like wasting anymore time before the show so we just left. Service sucked and guy behind the counter was completely rude. If I could give no stars I would." u"Convenient but the cashier was extremely hostile. When I didn't have cash to meet the $7 minimum she seized the food out of my hand and claimed I was lying. I just wanted a quick breakfast sandwich not a side of attitude. I'll go elsewhere." u'Had breakfast take out this morning and it couldn\'t be much worse; pre-made pancakes were awful and scrambled eggs platter had the worst home fries I have ever seen. Best part at check out it was $19 and change I used my credit card and after the transaction noticed we were only given two small imitation syrups when I asked for an extra I was told it would been an extra quarter; I apologized for not having any cash and offered my credit card but that was refused due to a $7 minimum. I said to her " I just spent $19 can you give an extra as a courtesy " and the answer was no.' u"Had the chicken that looked like Sesame Chicken. Taste is okay but it's only barely warn. (5pm on a Friday).  Tried the pork slices- they look delicious..... Lukewarm too. Tried the chicken wing. Nice and crispy not too much seasoning. Lukewarm too. I'm suprised that they put out so much food and let it sit on such an uncared for fashion. \n\nDo you still want to eat here? Maybe try the pre- made subs instead.  The place looks clean the staff is not rude-- but is indifferent...." u"I've had breakfast at Danny's many times (in part because of the Morgan Stanley employee discount.). Even without the discount it's a good place to get a cheap breakfast (eggs/omelettes/potatoes fruit etc)." u"The one star is for the hardworking guys behind the counter. Place smells bad and is filthy. I work across the street and every once in a while I give it another try because it's so convenient but it's throwing money away. They got an A from the inspection?  Obviously the inspectors accept bribes." u'This deli gets one star because we decided to eat upstairs.the area is awfuldirty chairs are old with stains all over a horrible place to sit down and eat.  The high price they charge for water $3.50?should give them enough funds to remodel upstairs.  The bathroom was terrible we decided not to use it.\nThe sandwich guys work hard and my wrap was very good.  The cashiers are not friendly just automated to take your money.  Whomever owns this needs to spend and update it cause the dept of health might shut it down based on upstairs' u'Anytime you have a 24hour convenience store close to any hotels is a bonus to buy your munchies on the way home.\n\nliked the fact their apples wrapped in sera wrap for hygienic purposes lol.\n\njust watch your step getting in here.' u'Fair deli food. Good place for breakfast if staying at hotel Edison. Upstairs could use cleaning. But fair price and better than most hotel continental breakfasts.  Open 24 hours.  Sandwiches and eggs are good.' u'Love the breakfast sandwiches A nice Deli to day its right off times square' u"I work a block away from this place. I would get food from there far more often if it weren't for the hostile Hispanic young woman who works the cash register during the days. (I DARE YOU to try and say a simple 'hello' to her as you are purchasing your $12 lunch!) Because of her I avoid the place; I would rather get a $4 falafal from the middle eastern joint on 9th Ave between 48th & 49th for lunch--much healthier far cheaper and without the bad vibes from that angry little woman at Danny's! (Not to mention Danny's being a tourist joint doesn't give a damn whether or not you find the food or service satisfactory; tourists are a dime-a-dozen so why should they care?)"],0.5801,0.155,0.845,0.0
29.Ipanema Restaurant,[u"We started the meal with complementary bread and butter. I ordered the cheesy shrimp steak with jumbo crab meat on top and he ordered the steak with pork belly and chorizo. Both came out promptly with a rice beans and tomato salsa. \n\nI loved my steak and it had a hint of a sweet marinade it while his was more garlic flavored. The beans were flavorful and the rice was nicely done. The service was great and everything was timely. It's a great place near the theatre district for a pre-show dinner" u'The food was very very very good. I ordered the most popular dish on the menu and my friends ordered the Tuesday special. Both of them are very good. David was very nice and friendly. I will definitely go there again. \n\nThe food was so good and I went to the restaurant again in the same week. Service was perfect David was super nice and friendly. The food was awesome. I will go there again next week' u"I've been here 3 times and every time their service is on point.\nThe food is delicious and service is fast which is always appreciated.\nI've started having business dinners here as well since the restaurant is spacious and they have a second floor as well to easily accommodate larger parties. \n\nThe appetizers came out so fast and entrees followed right after. The only thing that took sometime was the Portuguese egg tarts but that's fine since the taste well made up for it. \nI'll definitely be returning!" u"I was in the mood for a meaty meat tasting steak so I sauntered along 46th street until I spotted Ipanema Restaurant. I love Brazilian restaurants in particular the way the cut prepare and season their meats so I knew I was in luck. \n\nAccordingly I ordered an aged top-sirloin picanha cut done rare. As Ipanema usually serves such on sizzling plater I opted out knowing that my steak would quickly overcook. When served it came with three very nice cuts was rare as ordered and most properly seasoned.\n\nOverall Ipanema has a touch of elegance and class to it. The wait staff is top line professional as well as being more than just helpful. Then as for prices three good aged picanha for $24 is just about as good a deal as you'll ever get." u"Certain dishes were very tasty and it's definitely great bang for your buck. I was disappointed that my shrimp salad had literally one shrimp in it but the bitoque was excellent. The paella was okay - not really the right texture but it had good flavor. Fried bananas and potato chips were decent. 3.5 stars." u'Enjoyed the food drinks and service here. \n\n\nI really enjoyed the steak potatoes and egg dish. The steak was so tender!!!\n\nThe meat specialty rice and beans dish was good but I would not order it again. \n\nYou MUST ORDER the coconut cream cocktail!!\nIt tasted super delicious like a sweet coconut ice cream with alcohol. \n\nThe service here is great. The restaurant was very comfortable to sit and enjoy a meal. Great atmosphere - fun and casual. The tables are not packed super tight haha.' u"I just want to thank God and Yelp for bringing me to Ipanema and leading me to order the Bitoque!!! Steak and medallion potatoes with an egg over it - it was so freaking good. So were all the appetizers and everyone's else's meals! We also loved the cocktails! \n\nMy family and I came here with a group of about 25. We sat upstairs and had enough space for all of us (plus a stroller) at one table. The staff was good at taking all of our orders and keeping our drinks full! \n\nParking was surprisingly easy. If you don't find street parking there's a garage right across the street." u'It was a rather slow weeknight we had chosen for a "surprise" birthday dinner for my cousin. Of course he was gracious and obliged the surprise. \n\nDecor and service was just ok. The steak and medallion potatoes Spanish styled is dressed in a delicious gravy and topped with a runny egg. Score. Calamari had a sweet sauce could\'ve been crispier but what can I say? You can almost never go wrong with breaded fried calamari. It\'s like bad fried chicken. That just doesn\'t exist. \n\nThe sausage ragu and seafood w squid ink rice were forgettable. Good thing cousins Now Wife brought reinforcement- a whole Lady M green tea crepe cake! Sometimes it pays off to not overeat dinner.' u"This place is pretty freaking good and the location itself isn't too bad either. They have an excellent selection of traditional Brazilian dishes that are seasoned and presented quite nicely. The waitstaff is fairly average but the caipirinhas are stiff and legitimate. Overall if you're craving traditional Brazilian and don't necessarily want a churrascaria Ipanema is a great option. \n\nLegit-\nLarge portions \nGreat seasoning \nStiff drinks \nGreat Location \n\nMeh-\nSlow service \nGreasy \nSmall and loud" u'Nothing reminds me more of why I hate people than Times Square fortunately this was just far enough away that we didn\'t need to suffer crowds on date night. My partner\'s food was amazing and mine was mediocre at best. We both shared the croquette sampler. It included four croquettes a beef codfish shrimp and chicken croquette with a delicious sauce. I wouldn\'t recommend this for more than two people because the croquettes are about one inch in size. The churrasco Ipanema was covered in lump crab meat shrimp and cheese accompanied by well-seasoned potatoes rice and beans I highly recommend it. The steak was cooked just as we asked and the shrimp was succulent. I kept asking my partner for more! Mine however was a disappointment. It was a daily special fettuccine with clams in a garlic oil sauce. The clams were decent the fettuccine was al Dante but what disappointed me was the garlic oil sauce. It seemed that the pasta was boiled with onions and garlic then thrown on the plate. There was no "sauce". If the onions would have been caramelized or the garlic saut\xe9ed for a bit the dish would have been absolutely fantastic but what I had was not worth $22...it was full of clams so it wasn\'t a waste! I just feel it was executed poorly. Our service was spotty. We were late for our reservation but the host still made sure we were seated in a timely manner. Bread and water were constantly refilled and that was a relief to me. (This would be really great for tourists.) But our waiter didn\'t show up until we had looked at the menu for 15 minutes. We could have ordered an appetizer or drinks during that time. Would I go back? In a city as big as New York probably not. Am I glad I experienced cheeses shrimp crab steak? YES!!!' u'We were a large group but the service fast and fairly friendly. I tried some apps and had an octopus salad for my main. Very limited vegetarian options as expected but caipirinhas were strong and not too sweet.' u"If you're catching a Broadway show this spot is soso convenient. I was able to make a reservation online for lunch on a Saturday. But quite honestly there were so many tables inside I don't think a reservation was even needed. I ordered a Paelha Negra Bitoque and the Picanha. I recommend the Paelha Negra and Bitoque as I found the Picanha to be rather flavorless. I think the Paelha Negra was well worth the money as the squid was enormous. For me the egg on the Bitoque really made it that much better. \n\nMy only issue with this place is despite how empty it was service was so slow. it took about 20 minutes till a waiter came. Even when I asked another person if I can order they told me I had to wait. My drinks didn't come till after my meal came out. They even cooked the wrong paella and had to recook it too. If the service gets better I'd give this place another chance." u"Ipanema was a good find. The drinks are strong and the food is good. Rafael was an awesome waiter - he didn't pressure us but he made suggestions when asked. He was attentive and prompt with everything we needed. I didn't get our bartender's name but she was very sweet & hooked us up with some fantastic drinks throughout the evening. \n\nThe food (calamari potatoes mushrooms sauteed vegetables & fried bananas) all tasted good with no complaints. The sauces are flavorful (and spicy). I hesitate to critique the authenticity of foods from places I haven't traveled to but I was pleased with everything that came our way & would venture a guess that their dishes are on point with traditional Brazilian fare.\n\nThe restaurant is tucked away on 46th street so it's easy to miss. The space is also small but it holds quite a few mid-sized parties without feeling crowded. When we got there it was practically empty. We didn't notice how packed it got until we were ready to leave." u"The place was looks decent it was quite fine and I really love the ambiance. I came here with my friends the other day together with my family and we had a great experience. It's my third time to visit and I was a bit upset with the service. The crew who served our food was very mean and when I asked for a cup of water they didn't give me any. Food was good though specially the Seabass. I would highly recommend it to try it out." u"I had an amazing visit to Ipanema. The food the servers and of course my waiter (Gustavo?) I was dining alone but he was so wonderful that I felt like I was on a date with him. \n\nI started off with the saut\xe9ed shrimp and a Brazilian margarita. Then I finished off with the Picanha (top sirloin with pineapple fries beans rice etc). Everything was bomb and boy was I stuffed. It was my first meal of the day and I had plans to roam the city but the itis hit me like that Mr. Krabs meme. I didn't leave my hotel again until 10:00pm. \n\nCurse you Ipanema made me waste en entire Saturday on New York." u'Everything was great here! This place has the most authentic Brazilian and Latin American food. They offer a variety of LatAm food. \n\nThe signature of the restaurant is the Paella the must-have for many Spanish or LatAm restaurant. I ordered Paella here which tasted so authentic :) The seafood were fresh and the rice were immersed with full taste. My friend ordered squid ink Paella as well which tastes good as well. I have had many Paella in the city or in other places this place is one of the best! Another recommendation is the Avocado Crab meat. I enjoyed every bite of that dish! The Crab meat together with the avocado is a beyond amazing combination. \n\nIpanema has the greatest location near time square and fifth avenue a definitely great place to hang out with friends.' u"This is a portugese brazilian restaurant and serves Latin American dishes with more of a Brazilian touch to it. The waiters/staff are very accommodating. We were given slices of soft bread and butter. Then we ordered some cocktails-We started with the Anacate Recheado as appetizer- presented with a whole avocado sliced in half and filled with lightly seasoned lump crabmeat -would probably recommend this ! For the main course we have the Paella Negra- ricegreen peas and squid slices cooked in black squid ink topped with octupus and shrimps- unique and something different . Our dessert is the tres leches cake- it's soft creamy and milky. \n\nOverall I will give 5 stars for service but probably 3 stars for food and flavor since it didn't excite my palate as I'm hoping it would.\n\nAmbiance is romantic. Noise level is moderate." u"The Bitoque is so good! It's a steak dish with garlic sauce and fried potato slices: YES meat and carbs. The garlic sauce adds a great flavor to the steak and they cooked it a perfect medium-rare like I asked. The fried potato slices are also delicious and add a different texture. However I feel like the dish needed something to offset the heaviness and saltiness - like a salad or something acidic to cut the fattiness of the dish. They also give you rice and black beans which tasted nice with the garlic sauce. And who doesn't love more carbs?! There's also free bread and butter!\n\nThe host was very friendly and our waiter gave us great service! He came by often to refill our water and check up on us. \n\nIt's a pretty pricey meal coming in at $26 (not including tip) but it's definitely worth checking out. I hear it's one of a few great dining spots in this area of NY." u'After gorging myself on delicious bread and butter I tried several things all delicious: Camar\xe3o\nIpanema - Sauteed Shrimp (amazing) and the Robalo GrelhadoBroiled -Portuguese Sea Bass\nlighty seasoned with rock salt (also amazing).' u"I was hoping for really delicious food after seeing the great reviews but for the cost it was a bit of a letdown. I liked the medium rare steak's tenderness but found the sauce in the bitoque too salty. If that had just tasted better this dish would've been phenomenal--I mean it's steak and potatoes. In my eyes they had taken two wonderful ingredients and doused them in this mediocre bizarrely unappetizing sauce. It was similar to eating a tonkotsu noodle bowl with all of the salt but only half the flavor. I liked the complimentary bread and butter more as well as the potatoes on their own.\n\nOn 7:30 PM on a weekday Ipanema was packed and loud which usually isn't a problem but it wasn't the best choice for a first date. Luckily the two of us were able to be seated without reservations. The crowd seems more mature here as well. It's not a place for a casual dinner but at the same time this only raised my expectations of the food. I can see that the dish is expensive because of the steak but it overall seemed more fit to be served at a cozy family diner at the fraction of the cost.\n\nI was impressed with the service because I was given extra potatoes for free when the server saw that I had finished all of mine. Good service but the prices and signature dish didn't convince me to come back again."],-0.0413,0.114,0.762,0.124
199.Lil’ Gem,[u"Wonderful experience at lil' gem last night. A cozy space with delicious food and fantastic service! We were so impressed with our waitress who was attentive but not overbearing. Definitely going back. Great for dates and dinners with friends or parents. Jason (manager?) at lil' gem is a true gem as well!\n\nRecommendations: \n- eggplant flatbread\n- lamb chops" u"Great place with a nice casual but still chic atmosphere ! \nThe food is delicious and not too expensive (we had a large portion of lamb shawarma with pickles bread sauces and herbs really filling for 2 for $22). Rather than Lebanese it's some kind of Ottolenghi-style Levantine food with pomegranate yogurt lamb and cauliflower - plus a NYC-LES touch). We didn't try the cocktails/wines but there is a wide choice.\nThe people are really nice not snobbish at all and seem happy to work together which gives a friendly twist to the whole cozy atmosphere.\nI definetely recommend it ! (To show I'm honest and not all too naive I was just disappointed by too salty olives - but offered as an amuse bouche even if we didn't order drinks - and the bread which was too greasy and closer to a failed naan than a real pita)." u"Update: they adjusted the menu accordingly. Got some other things\n\nNew very good Lebanese place in this ever expanding area. I sat at the bar which was fine. To drink I asked for something sour. He recommended two drinks and I chose the Sidekick. While I didn't taste the sumac much the drink itself was quite good and balanced between the spirits/lemon. After some recommendations I eventually went with some of their vegetarian options with one of their flatbreads as a main.\n\nFried cauliflower lemon Sumac (9):\n\nNicely flavored with the sumac these were well fried with a light batter. Great textures and flavors. There was also some lemon pieces in there.\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts Pearl Onions Dill Pomegranate molasses (14)\n\nRoasted nicely again. I think the dill (or what seemed to be parsley) was not chopped up enough so having to either eat either large strands or eat around it was a little bit tough. Surprisingly there were some roasted squash in there as well. It added a lot to the flavor so I don't mind. There was a good sour/sweetness from the pomegranate.\n\nRoasted Mushroom and Pearl Onion Baharat Flatbread (18)\n\nEasily the biggest dish there were 4 large pieces covered with spiced assorted mushrooms and pearl onions along with a lebneh(?) on the bottom. It could have probably filled me up alone and I brought home two of the sections. The lebneh made it a bit difficult to pick up and eat but the flavors were outstanding. As with all the other dishes the chef clearly knows what she is doing with vegetables.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are some extra flavors/add-ons in some of these dishes that aren't listed on the menu. For example the menu doesn't list the lebneh/yogurt below the mushrooms and it was definitely a main ingredient.\n\nAs the place had only been open for a week no dessert menu. The service was overall outstanding. There were credit card issues there and they took off one of the appetizers from the bill and gave me an extra drink on the house. Nice way of making it so people want to go back.\n\nThis place reminded me of Zahav which is not a bad thing at all. I'll be back very soon. 4.7" u"Clinton Street gets funky. A newly revived restaurant row has sprouted and Lil Gem is the jewel on the crown. Minnie Simply Hooked Speedy Romeo's and Byggz Sandwich shop and more. Lil' Gem offers a room with cushioned baguettes and a beamed ceiling. The room transports you to a Middle Eastern living room Clever Mediterranean flavors really shine from the open kitchen.\nPreview menu on the opening night.\nAte:\nMuhamarra & flatbread\nFried cauliflower\nWhole fish\nTotal: $43\nThe muhamarra is a red pepper dip topped with walnuts(toasted) Exotic flavor and crunchy walnuts is  the ideal spot to dip this double zero flour hot flatbread. Lemony fried cauliflower also works great with the dip. The whole fish was melt in your mouth- simply seared with salt pepper and garlic- the seafood equivalent of a perfectly cooked steak. Scrumptious! Super friendly and welcoming room and bringing monstrous Mediterranean flavors to the LES!" u'Absolutely amazing! Service is flawless and the food guys... OMG hard to describe! You have to come over and try whatever you feel like or the waiter suggests you. Might be hard not to like anything!!' u"The fermented hummus and lamb dishes were delicious! They are friendly have good wines and cocktails and have comfortable booth-like seating arranged around the bar. The za'atar bread was tasty and the open skillet shawarma presentation fun and easily shared." u"Love Love Love.  Best Lamb Chops I've ever had!  The Hummus is so good.  Probably as good as I've had in Tel Aviv (I know It's a Lebanese place).  My partner said his Whole Bronzino was perfect.  Oh the cocktails were delicious.  Just go.  Have fun and enjoy.  Can't wait to bring back some friends." u'love this place. cozy seating but still lively. Food is awesome. Anything with labneh is a must plus a schwarma and lamb chops were to die for. all fairly priced. Give some leeway to service as they get ramped up. Best of luck.'],0.6369,0.677,0.323,0.0
54.Samba Kitchen & Bar,[u"The best Brazilian food in all of NYC and it's not close. My better half is Brazilian and we drool even thinking of going here.\n\nService is top notch portions are large and picanha farofa and pao de queijo are to die for....can't recommend enough! Get the brigadeiros if you can - they run out quick.\n\nShout out to Leo - the best waiter!" u"We ended up at Samba before a show because our reservation elsewhere was taking too long. The ambiance looked relaxing from the outside and there was no wait to be seated on a Saturday night. At first that made me nervous but the food coming out around us looked delicious.\n\nMy husband had the salmon and loved the flavors. I had the moqueca which is fish stew in a creamy lighter red sauce. It was wonderful and the fish was fresh and tenderly cooked. \n\nWe didn't have the flan but the couple next to us did and it looked and smelled great. \n\nAs far as cocktails I had the New York Smash. It's gin blackberries and sangria. I really enjoyed it but it's a bit thick as you get to the end. The raspberries are muddled and the seeds sit at the bottom. I love blackberries so it worked for me.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised and will be back again!" u"You absolutely have to get the Camar\xe3o Grelhado (shrimp appetizer) and I highly recommend the Picanha na Chapa. If you do both of these and split it two-ways you should leave satisfied!\n\nThe flavor of the shrimp was incredible and if you like spicy then you should ask for the homemade chili  oil sauce. \n\nI was very pleased with the steak as well as it was cooked perfectly and had a lot more flavor than expected. I was imaging that it'd be a little bland as Brazilian steaks tend to be but it needed no salt pepper or sauce whatsoever. \n\nI went on a Sunday night and took my CEO. We were both very happy with the food atmosphere and service. I will definitely go back and would like to try the Camar\xe3o no Coco as an entree." u"We came here for the brunch and left with decidedly mixed feelings. We had hoped for better given all the great reviews.\n\nFirst off they had live music when we came here with a really talented guitarist and singer playing some great songs as we ate. We walked in and they took a bit of time to get our table ready even though they were far from being full. And even after we were seated the table next to ours was not cleaned and had a bunch of flies buzzing around the leftovers which kind of put us off. But they were really accommodating and gracefully moved us to a different table when we requested.\n\nOur server was really attentive and polite and was very helpful with his explanations for the different menu items. We chose the sweet pancakes and the ham and cheese sandwich from the brunch section which in hindsight was probably not the best choice. The pancakes were really really sweet and the sandwich lacked flavor.The croquettes we got for appetizers were quite good though. And the best thing we got was the coconut caiprinha which was tasty and strong.\n\nI'd probably try the picanha or feijoada next time if I come back here." u"Sat at the bar for happy hour on Friday. Great place for some good happy hour drinks that last until 7pm. Bartender working that night was super nice and had a great understanding of the caipirinhas he was serving. I tried the guava caiprinhas and it was great! The guava taste really stood out. For $8 I thought it was well worth the try. Other parts of their happy hour includes $5 beers and $8 glass of sangria. \n\nI didn't have the opportunity to try the food but it definitely smelled amazing in there. Definitely will want to check this place out again." u"We came here for one of my best friends' birthday dinner and the atmosphere was infectiously cheery. There was live music playing (a tad too loud for my liking but they played happy birthday for us so it was all good). The waiters were also wonderfully friendly without being pushy - making sure we had all our food and drink on time.\n\nThe extent of my previous experience with Brazilian food is pretty much limited to Fogo de Chao so I was happy to expand my horizons here. Just about everything we had was memorable from the various offered flavors of caipirinha to the grilled shrimp appetizer to the picanha entree. Apparently Brazilians eat lots of things including barbecued meats and fejioada with toasted yucca flour which is a really novel texture at first but really quite tasty - a bit of a nutty taste like very finely ground peanuts. I like it.\n\nLove the decor too - the walls were covered with old photos of the great Ayrton Senna which just made the ambiance feel extra Brazilian. Samba is simply a great time all around and a fantastic choice for a casual dinner or a special event." u'A great spot for food & drinks... we must get back for happy hour. \n\nThe bread was a good start then we ordered the octopus salad and kale salad for apps. The octopus was super tender - but maybe a little too soft for our liking. The kale was very simple - a pile of kale with some mangoes and tomatoes. We ended up mixing the two together... the juices from the octo salad with the crunchiness of the kale made for a REALLY good start to the meal.\n\nWe had the salmon (huge piece) with broccoli and peas and the Moqueca- a slow cooked tilapia in a red coconut broth. The salmon was very good and te Moqueca was amazing. We also tried the Vatapa which was very similar to the Moqueca but in a white coconut broth. It was also excellent. \n\nWe also tried every Caipirinha on the menu. Once we had two different ones and there were only two more we had to give them a shot. I am partial to the traditional and she was more interested in the passion fruit. The strawberry was very strawberry and the coconut was like dessert. \n\nThis is a very good place reasonably priced and we can only imagine the happy hour is a huge hit. We will be back!' u"An unexpectedly good dinner at an unassuming spot. I tend not to expect excellence among the many Ninth Avenue spots in Hell's Kitchen. They typically seem more about volume and drinking than quality dining. Samba Kitchen was warm and friendly just like being in Brazil and the house caipirinha was stellar and flavor balanced definitely worth a second round. The bartender was friendly and attentive and we ordered the moqueca a seafood stew that got good reviews and the camarao no coco my choice: I give it a hearty thumbs up. Served inside half of a scooped out coconut and ringed by frilly mashed potatoes the shrimp in a coconut curry like sauce was terrific and the presentation was a winner too." u"Such an awesome place! First things first the staff at this restaurant are extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about the cuisine! The caipirinha was tasty but didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it. The Brazilian cheese bread to start oh my god. I could have eaten 3 baskets of that bread for dinner alone! The yucca fries were really good as well perfectly cooked! We got the picanha for 2 and the meat was really well cooked and flavorful! Served also with rice and beans as well as pico de gallo. They also served it with yucca flour we asked the server what it was for an he told us you can basically put it on whatever you want its kind of like bread crumbs! All the food was so good so the bill added up at the end so this is definitely a date night kind of place and not necessarily a casual dinner spot" u'This was an unplanned walk-in experience after seeing an Off-Broadway play in the area.  As we walked along 9th Ave we saw and heard live Brazilian music coming from the open front of this bar/restaurant.  No brainer to go in.\n\nOrdered caipirinhas and shared an order of Moqueca which is a fish stew served with rice and beans.  Nice food drinks music and atmosphere.\n\nWill return for sure. :)' u"More 4.5 stars. A bit on the pricey side but sooooo good. For drinks I got the Guava Caipirinha which was delicious! For dinner I strongly suggest the coconut shrimp. While the presentation is a bit much (it comes in a coconut surrounded by mashed potatoes!) it's absolutely delicious. Service was also great. The waiter allowed us to eat with little interruptions but made sure to check in when we got our food and when he saw that things were running low. Can't wait to go back! Especially for another condiment container of their hot sauce :)" u'Went here last night for a "bachelor party." There were six of us and we only ordered drinks. The servers were all very friendly and nice to us! It was a Thursday night so maybe that\'s why it wasn\'t too busy? \n\nI ordered their mixed drinks with cachas\xe3 (sp?). Very strong! Lol! But they had happy hour so they were only $8 drinks! I drank a guava version as well as a passion fruit version. So good and affordable especially for NY! \n\nHowever during the whole time we were there we smelled their food. Had we not eaten beforehand we would\'ve eaten here because every time they brought out a dish it smelled AMAZING!!!!! Like no joke my whole party almost just ordered food anyway from the smell alone!!' u"When we walked by on a Sunday afternoon we were lured into Samba's by the nice live music and promise of Caiprinas. It looked really cute and the staff seamed very friendly.\n\nWe saw the price of the cocktails and we were really surprised at how expensive they were especially given how inexpensive the restaurants in the area are for brunch. While I can't remember the exact price point it disappointed both of us who were still on a budget. We opted for a coffee and a latte instead. My latte was good but the coffee was watery and tasteless. We asked them to take it back and bring out a latte instead because it was undrinkable. Again the staff was very friendly and happy to accommodate.\n\nWe ordered the Brazilian Breakfast and the Steak Sandwich. The steak sandwich was great and had delicious cuts of steak paired with creamy melted cheese. I wish I could say the same about the Brazilian Breakfast which was rather flavorless and disappointing. What was worse was that the eggs were cold! This really surprised us and was the last straw for us.\n\nDon't think I'll be coming back." u'Came here for brunch this time and still absolutely loved it. \nThe service and food were excellent everything I love about local restaurant. They were so attentive and food was delicious I absolutely love it and will come back again.\nThe steak sandwich veggie omelette and grilled shrimp are highly recommended!' u"Food is delicious. Especially the sizzling steak. \n\nCame here twice already. Second time I took my family (8ppl) here for Father's day dinner. Almost everything we ate was good. The waitress who served us was also upbeat and nice and made our dinner enjoyable. \n\nTo start off we had the octopus and the cheese bread. The octopus tasted good and the whole dish was really refreshing. Cheese bread was baked fresh as well and also tasted pretty good. It was warm and texture was dense. It had a deep subtle cheese flavor that wasn't too overwhelming.\nFirst time I came we had the white wine clams and that was really good too.\n\nMy favorite entree from this place would be the PICANHA NA CHAPA which is the sizzling steak. We ordered the plate for 2 ppl and it comes with 4 pieces of steak. It is DELICIOUS.  You can smell the plate from a mile away and it smells gorgeous. Smells like a mix of garlic beef fat butter. I'm not even sure what's in there but it's good. They cooked it perfectly at medium rare the way we ordered it. \n\nGrilled Pork chops were also delicious. Cooked with garlic. \n\nI had the salmao grelhado (salmon) and it was cooked nicely as well. It was moist had a nice fresh flavor drizzled with a little bit of lemon. Only thing I didn't like on my plate was the peas. I'm not particularly fond of peas. \n\nSister ordered the feijoada with meat pork shoulder etc. It's basically a pot of black beans cooked with pork meat. Sauce was heavy and flavorful. It tasted good but a bit too heavy for me. \n\nAlso tried the moqueca white fish. Sauce is also flavorful. It's not spicy but it has a minor hint of kick. Tastes good with the rice. \n\nAll in all we had a nice enjoyable meal that wasn't too expensive. I would come back again." u"This place is special. I was looking for a brunch spot in my Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. I came here for brunch on a Sunday. I was welcomed by the friendly hostess (Laura) who sat me down immediately. There are various choices on the menu for brunch. I ordered the Brazilian Breakfast which consisted of two eggs sausage bacon french fries collard greens and toast. This dish did not disappoint. Although the portions seem small the dish was very filling. I also had the national Brazilian drink Caipirinha (rum lime cachaca sugar) very good. Our waitress Josie was very sweet cheerful and knowledgable. To add to an already great brunch experience they had a live band playing. I mean who doesn't want to eat drink and listen to live music at the same time. This place deserves a visit." u'The atmosphere is noisy yet welcoming upon entering.  Our server came to us promptly after we were seated and our hostess was sure to inform us of an area to check our coats at as well as the restroom whereabouts.\n\nWe perused the menu and asked for recommendations as usual.  There was the house Malbec which is by the glass and we decided on surf and turf.  The surf was the moqueca; the turf was Picanha an chapa.\n\nOur server came out with two kinds of house wines to taste.  The Malbec was very tasty and the Cabernet just needed to be left to the skies for a little while before ready.  We selected the Malbec smooth and perfect to pair with the steak.\n\nThe moqueca was delicious a creamy blend of seafood and our server brought out the rice and beans and chili sauce to compliment the moqueca.  I loved it!\n\nThe Picanha an chapa was brought out on a sizzling griddle the meat was savory and cooked medium but after it sat on the griddle for awhile turned to medium well which was perfect for us.  They had flour and a fresh style salsa similar to pico de gallo.  We were advised to mix the rice beans flour and pico de gallo together with the meat and that was the best advice!  I loved it!!\n\nThe service was excellent; our water was kept full and when we asked for more rice our server was very obliging.\n\nThis is a place to come for good food!!  The place was clean and the bathroom was too.' u'The food was pretty good here but the drinks were on fire!! So delicious! I had the coconut and strawberry caipirinhas.\n\nWaiters were so sweet and respectable. It was such a busy night and yet they made sure we were happy and comfortable.\n\nIn terms of the food the fried chicken from the appetizers seemed a but over cooked so it was a bit difficult to chew. I definitely recommend the buttery garlic shrimp and the yuka fries.' u"I am lucky enough to visit NYC every year or so with 2 college friends. They are in the know about what plays/musicals to see and I like to eat. I get to pick the restaurants and for this trip this one was the restaurant I was the most excited about.\n\nI had perused the menu ahead of time and had selected the Frango tropical. Of course once we are seated I had to verify that this was my final answer. Without any life line I stuck with my choice and boy was I glad that I did. I still dream about this chicken with fruits and starches. \n\nIf a fantasy come true entree wasn't enough we also had a marvelous table and superb service. This was my first savoring of Brazilian food and I picked the right place for launching a new taste sensation.\n\nI can't wait to increase my Brazilian foodie experiences!" u'We came here on a Sunday to meet friends for lunch and it looks like we are going to stay the entire afternoon!  \n\nThe food is excellent authentic Brazilian - appetizers main dishes and desserts that one of our party said was "like being home"!\n\nand then there is the literally traffic-stopping singing & music that nobody on the sidewalk doesn\'t stop to listen!'],0.8065,0.208,0.744,0.048
170.Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,[u'What a cute little find!!!! My 8yr old insisted on Chinese for dinner and I wanted Italian so happy I listened to her! We loved everything we ordered! The place is very tiny and manages to stay very busy considering all the places to eat around \nWe sat next to a group who were very friendly they introduced us to the steamed buns \nOMG sooooo good!!!! \nFood is excellent and quick!!! \nHappy we stopped' u'I love this place! \n\nLet\'s just note that this place is a CHINESE ramen place. So yeah that is confusing but they say "ramen" because the literal translation in Chinese is LA MIAN..kinda sounds like ramen right? On that note I\'ve ordered from them on seamless at least 3 times now and my food has come earlier than expected and my order has been right too! They even package their soup dumplings so well individual little pockets. So cute. \n\nThings I highly recommend: \n*Soup dumplings - some of the best I\'ve had in the city! Really yummy great amount of soup and soft dumpling skin\n*Scallion pancakes - I\'m not someone who really eats scallion pancakes and one night I decided to try them with beef and wow oh wow are they delicious!!!! Like so good (repeat 5 times). I kind of felt like it was peking duck scallion pancakes but with beef!\n*Pan-fried pork dumplings - they come in 6 and they are delicious so meaty and very filling\n\nI look forward to trying other things on their menu!!' u'My daughter introduced us to this place!\nQuaint & fast restaurant if u want to get dinner before a play!!\nLove the juicy dumplings! My daughter loves the scallion with meat pancakes!!!\nSo reasonably cheap without having to go to Chinatown!!!\nQuck & fast so that u have lots of time for ypur play!!!' u"Heard about this location through a friend who was in the area the same time I was.  This place has a very typical storefront but let me tell you that the food they serve is anything BUT typical.  I've had a lot of soup dumplings and I had heard that this place made them pretty well so I figured I'd stop in right before heading to a lunch reservation.  We only ordered the soup dumplings as well as the pan fried pork dumplings and OH MAN I wish I had more time to eat here. \n\nMost problems I've experienced with soup dumplings is either the filling or soup lacking flavor OR the skin of the dumpling being way too thick.  This place manages to be successful on BOTH fronts as the skin was very tender and delicate and each dumpling was packed with a flavorful soup and pork filling.  The pan fried dumplings were also fantastic with a nice chewy (yet crispy) outside and a extremely  tender and flavorful filling.\n\nIf I didn't have that lunch reservation I may have stayed longer to enjoy more dumplings but alas i'll have to return the next time I'm in town.  Prices are reasonable (especially since it's located next to Times Sq) so don't worry about being ripped off as the prices and taste is well above what I had expected!" u"Came here with two friends on a Sunday night around 8 PM and the place was packed. We were seated at at large table with another group of three. The whole process was pretty quick we were given menus and had our order taken right away. \n\nWe ordered two pork steamed buns one house special stir-fried ramen and an order of scallion pancakes. The steamed buns had great flavor it's not super hot though which is both a good and bad thing. It's nice that you don't burn your tongue on the soup but at the same time having a tiny piping pocket of soup is always a comfort. Additionally I must be used to Taiwanese Xiao Long Baos because I like the skins to be on the thinner sides so I found these to be slightly thicker than how I usually like them. \n\nThe house special stir fried ramen was really delicious. Great flavor but not too overbearing. Will definitely be back for these noodles next time. Finally the scallion pancakes were also delicious but would have them to be just a tad less doughy would have been nice if they were just a hair bit thinner.\n\nWhile the food was great the building is slightly more dilapidated like a Chinese restaurant you would expect to see in Chinatown or Flushing. But all in all the Kung Fu XLB was able to provide a great meal for my friend and I. They definitely found some more return customers!" u'Good to have a soup dumplings place in Times Square. Rather limited menu and prices are higher compared to other locations. Food was okay overall.' u"Decent XLB if you're looking for one in Hell's Kitchen area and too far from Chinatown and Flushing. I especially liked the XLB take out packaging. It holds each XLB individually therefore chances of them breaking during delivery is minimal. Score!" u"Odd. I understand you have to get inventive with vegetable Ramen but odd choices. aside from the noodles that was bok choy which was great but then there were tomatoes sliced up as you would put in a salad and also cucumber or zucchini ...I couldn't tell. I can't believe I paid 14.75 for this! \n\non a better note the scallion pancake was good but they didn't include any soy sauce to dip" u"This is the third time I've been here and MAN these soup dumplings are fire. They are awesome ! I always get the steam pork dumplings the Peking duck bun and a pan fried dumpling. \n\nI have yet to have the noodles and that will be my next visit. \n\nThis is a tiny little hole in the wall place in the times square / midtown area. It's basically the only place I will go to in the area. It's cheap fast  and FANTASTIC." u"I came here craving pho or something to cure a hangover. It was kinda hidden in the midst of other doors to shops around it so although the inside only had less than 10 tables it wasn't very crowded. \n\nThey call it ramen but it seems more like braised beef noodle soup (what they're selling). My friend got the spicy version and I got the normal one. The broth was super good but the noodles were all stuck together like they'd just thrown a block of frozen noodles in there .__. So it was kinda hard to eat because I couldn't pull the noodles apart. \n\nI think there's a $15 credit card minimum as well so bring cash if you're paying for plates separately. They also do this sneaky thing on the check where they already add tip/gratuity to the total amount when they bring you the check so pay attention before adding additional tip." u"My friend and I were at a bar near Port Authority and she suggested that we stop at Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen to grab dinner before hopping on our respective buses to head back to Jersey.  Given that the restaurant was in such a busy and lame area near the bus station I had very low expectations.  However the food actually wound up being rather decent.  \n\nWe started with orders of both the Shrimp and the Pork Soup Dumplings.  Each delicate noodle was filled with flavorful broth.  The shrimp variety even had diced okra in the stuffing.  We then proceeded with Saut\xe9ed Bok Choy and Stir-Fried Spicy Mapo Tofu which were  both packed with flavor.  The tofu dish was a bit salty and oily though which made me even more annoyed that they did not sell sides of rice.  I had never heard of an Asian restaurant of any variety not serving rice to sop up all of their rich aromatic sauces.  However aside from this lack of starch I was pleasantly surprised with Kung Fu's offerings (warranting more like a 3.5-star rating) and would definitely be willing to return if I needed a spot near Port Authority." u"ORIGINALLY POSTED 9/25/15\n\nThank you Shake Shack (SS) for having a ridiculously stupid long line that flowed outside the full length of the restaurant. Thank you Pat F. oh that's me!... for using your instincts and saying to yourself 'self there has to be something better in the vicinity that I can find to eat.' So as I continued to walk about three blocks north away from SS I hit this little ramen shop that looked like a perfect spot before heading over to a Yelp on Broadway event. \n\nThe little restaurant only had a few tables occupied I checked out the menu and me myself and I decided this is where dinner will be had. By the time I ordered my Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings all the surrounding tables were filled. I thought to myself 'self this is a hot spot don't you think? Not only were there several dine-in customers but there were also orders being picked up one after the other. Perfect choice we thought to ourselves I mean myself...you know what I mean. \n\nAnyway my first Xiao Long Bao experience was only once countless years ago at Joe's Shanghai in midtown. Honestly I can barely remember how they tasted as it was more of figuring out how to not scald my mouth and not make a mess...was way too focused on skill and my dining companions for me to even remember what anything tasted like. Anywho once I got my steaming pork soup dumplings it was like riding a bike my muscle memory skills kicked in and I made the smart decision to pierce open each dumpling carefully as to not spill out all of that flavorful soup used my tongs slid bun on soup spoon carefully and slurped away...ahhh!!! That first slurp put a smile on my face as I mentally gave myself a pat (no pun intended) on the back for following my instincts. \n\nThank you self and of course Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen for filling my belly with your yummy Shanghainese cuisine. If in the area we I mean I will definitely be back!!!" u'Small store with great food.  Takes credit card too.\n\nFreshly made dumplings that was juicy and affordable.  One of the best Chinese restaurants in Hell Kitchen Area\n\nCrab Xiaolongbao is my favorite.\n\nHighly recommended.' u"Came in for a quick bite. Their steamed pork bun dumplings were oh my god amazing! I haven't had such amazing soup dumplings like this ever! Nothing can compare!! The broth inside is very generous and be careful when eating it because it is very hot! I like to add a little vinegar and soy sauce to add a little extra kick. Omg My mouth is watering now!! We also ordered some pan-fried dumplings which were okay. Nothing in comparison to the soup dumplings. Finally we ordered red bean paste buns which let me just say reminded me to my trip to china 12 years ago. They tasted so authentic and the bean paste was freshly made in-house. You could really taste the effort made into each bun. \n\nIf I am ever back in New York I will definitely return for some soup dumplings and red bean paste buns." u"The BEST Xiaolongbao in the city!\n\nI was simply blown away by their soup dumplings and was mad at myself for not finding this place earlier. The skin of the dumplings was just the right degree of thickness to hold the soup inside without ripping but at the same time so soft that it melted in my mouth and did not interfere with the taste of the soup and meat. It's actually amazing the skin doesn't rip 'cause the dumplings are filled to the max with soup--they are the most soupy soup dumplings I've ever had. The soup is absolutely delicious so flavorful and even refreshing that you don't want to stop eating. The dumplings have a good amount of meat too and the meat is also very delicious and juicy. Definitely the best Xiaolongbao in NYC and easily comparable to the best ones I've had in Shanghai. \n\nThe place is small and easy to miss but do give it a visit if you have the chance. The service is friendly and quick and the food is cheap but amazing. You won't regret it." u'Coming from me who were born and raised in Shanghai this place has the best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) Shanghai spring rolls wonton soup and sticky rice shaomai in Manhattan - forget about Joe\'s Shanghai this place is so much better. I believe that\'s enough said ;) Try the carb Xiao Long Bao - it\'s simply the best! I introduced my parents to this place when they visited from Shanghai and they were blown away! They even said this place is better than some places they\'ve been to at home in Shanghai. After I brought them here for the first time they had since come to this place 3 times by themselves during their 2 weeks visit. \n\nIn a matter of fact I have yet to find another place that sells such authentic and tasty Shanhai spring rolls wonton and shaomai in Manhatthan. You have other strong contenders for soup dumplings in the city since it has become a "thing" but the other authentic stuff are really rare to come by. \n\nSome comments say whatever they sell is not "Ramen". The word Ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese lamian (\u62c9\u9eb5) which means hand pulled noodles and that\'s exactly what they sell here. The spicy beef ramen is so good! Whatever they put in that sauce it\'s the magic. \n\nI have ordered delivery from here before but you gotta enjoy XLB fresh and hot. Do yourself a favor and visit this place and you will understand the charm of Shanghainese dim sum :)' u'***Please be aware if you are going to eat here.\n\nI always came here for a lunch and the food is so so but very cheap. The reason why l left only 1 star is this place\'s terrible service and tip "fraud".\n\nPlease be aware that 15% tip has been added in your bill! Please don\'t double tip them because those damn waiters/waitresses will never remind you. They will only cheat you for more tip even if customers are not well served.\n\nSHAME on this place......' u"I've been here twice once on a on a Friday around 6pm and the other time on a Saturday around 2pm.  \n\nAmbiance: There was no waiting time thus we were seated right away. Place is pretty spacious and the art on the wall is amazing. Bathroom is super clean with hand lotion and mouth wash.\n\nService: Good and quick.\n\nFood: We had the crab-meat soup dumplings the house special fried noodles and the eggs and tomatoes dish. We also had the  chicken dumplings fish dumplings scallion pancakes and eggs and chives patty. Most of the dumplings were decent not amazing but good. The fish dumpling was ehh. The noodles could had used a little more veggies but other than that no major complaints. Rest of the food was tasty.\n\nI have passed by this place many times and I thought that because of its location it would be a tourist trap but I was pleasantly surprised.  Never judge a place by its location.\n\nWould not object to returning!" u"I love soup dumplings.  This place has great soup dumplings the pan fried baos are very hot don't burn yourself." u'Food is nice nothing special. But the server rush you in everything you do even if the place is EMPTY. \nRude and unprofessional staff. Never again.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
108.Don Antonio,[u'I am in NYC quite frequently. I have tried to find a pizza that makes me say "THIS is good pizza!" Whether Don Antonia makes authentic New York pizza is probably up for debate. I couldn\'t care less about that. \n\nWhat I do care about is the following:\nDon Antonio makes a darn good margherita pizza (I added mushrooms).\nIt made me say "THIS is good pizza!"\nDelivery was quick.\nPrices are fair for the area.\n\nI will order from this establishment again.' u'I ordered 2 pizzas from here it was delicious. A magehrita pizza and a mushroom truffle one.  Both pizza\'s came a little soggy but I had it delivered so I don\'t hold it against them. I do hold the fact that I ordered an orange juice but they delivered an orangina instead. \n\nThe delivery speed is fast and I would eat there again!!  I had a hard time understanding the girl on the phone though. I basically was just saying "yes yes yes .." just deliver the pizza please! the rest is an afterthought.  For the beginning I thought she said she couldn\'t deliver.  I used the yelp app to order which.. i think needs work but overall the food was great!  I think there is better pizza but not sure if there is better delivery pizza!' u'I\'m a lover of Food Network\'s Diner Drive-in and Dives. I saw Don Antonio on there and the food looked amazing. I put it on my NY "to try" list. My husband and I wanted lunch and something small so what better than pizza at Don Antonio. Well the pizza wasn\'t as good as it looks. I guess eventually I\'ll learn to be more wise in the places I pick on certain restaurants I see on tv. Lately I\'ve tried a few tv places and they haven\'t lived up to the hype.\n\nMy husband and I ordered a pizza to share. We ordered a Margherita Pizza with Sausage & Mushroom. The pizza crust reminded me of crust in Italy. It was thin and had that true Italian flavor. The toppings themselves were bland and lacked in flavor. The sauce was nothing special. The sausage was flavorless and boring and the cheese was just cheese. Most Italian places have good sausage but this place the sausage sucked big time. It tasted like they got it from somewhere and it\'s not homemade. Not that they claimed it was homemade but once again most Italian restaurants make most of their stuff homemade. This pizza place definitely didn\'t meet true Italy flavor as a whole. It was a little disappointing. \n\nOverall this place wasn\'t bad for a quick meal but it wasn\'t what I had in mind. Somethings are literally for tv and that\'s it. I\'m learning everything you see on tv doesn\'t always live up to the hype!' u'This place did not disappoint we had just seen a terrific show across the street at the New World Stages and were dying to have great Pizza for dinner . Welllll this place was everything  the atmosphere was friendly and the music was upbeat and loud enough for a lively Friday night crowd. Cool thing at the kitchen there is a huge monitor where you can see your pizzas being made as you wait at your table  Try to sit at the back near the kitchen . Every pizza was PERFECT the crust was light fluffy but crisp enough to hold the delicious meat and vegetable and fresh mozzarella cheese.\nLove Don Antonios' u"Montanara pizza - Must order. Wonderful. The fried dough crust was very good just like the fried Chinese donuts. \n\nMargherita pizza - Refer to posted image. The 'white stuff' I saw on my pizza wasn't cheese. It was actual bread underneath because there wasn't enough marinara sauce on the top to begin with. It was floppy and sad. I had 2 pieces of basil. \n\nOther - All pizzas are personal-sized. However my Margherita looked 1.5x bigger than my friend's Montanara. They will not allow you to order sides of marinara sauce." u"Good go to for a classic Margherita pizza. Won't break the bank and it's just great quality. The red sauce is really good and the crust is nice and thin.\n\nLove the spicy oil that it comes with! Wait was about 30 minutes for a Thursday night around prime time. Definitely a doable wait for the quality you gey" u"Wasn't a fan of this. The pizza that we had (Marcellaio) had decent flavor but it was super doughy. The pontina salad was fine but the dressing was weirdly bitter. Sat near the door so we had cold air blowing on us but we needed a quick bite before a show so we couldn't wait for a better table. Service was fine." u"I've been wanting to come here since I heard it's related to Keste and it was pretty delicious. I went here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night and it was still pretty packed (though we didn't wait long for a table). I had tried coming here two weeks ago during a weekend and that was near impossible with an hour plus wait time. \n\nThe food is delicious. We went with one veggie pizza which was absolutely delicious especially the artichokes on top. The crust was also so yummy but the pizza itself did get a tad bit soggy after sitting on the table for 30ish minutes aka eat fast! We also got another pie of their fried pizza which my boyfriend and I weren't as big of fans of. It started off pretty great but the dough got a little over bearing with oil after a couple bites as did the smoky flavor of the cheese (too much pork like taste for me). \n\nAll in all though I would definitely come back for their pizza (would just opt for normal pies this time)." u"Yummy. Came here right before watching Cats on Broadway. Warning: The space is very tight here. The tables and chairs are literally right on top of each other (at the bar and in the dining area) so be sure to suck in your stomach when you get seated! \n\nWe came here on a Tuesday night around 6pm and it was full but not super packed. This was the 2nd time I've been here so I knew it was going to be good! This time I ordered the margherita pizza with sausage and shared it with my coworker. Tables next to us everyone was eating a whole pizza by themselves! I couldn't do it so I shared with my coworker. I loved the pizza. It's a thin crust and just so fresh. In the back they have an open kitchen. You can watch them knead the dough and put fresh ingredients to each pizza! Absolutely delicious! I wasn't extra full leaving there (with sharing 1 pizza) so it was perfect right before a 2 hour show.\n\nOur bill ended up being $37 for a diet pepsi (served in a mini glass bottle super cute!) a Moscow mule (served in the iconic mug) and the shared pizza. Everything is really good and the prices aren't too bad considering you're in the Times Square area!" u"Alright this is officially the best pizza I've ever had wow! I've never had a White Pizza before but man was it good!  This is the only pizza that I've had where I HAD to finish the crust it was that good. Plus the entire staff spoke Italian which was very interesting and it added to the authenticity of the whole experience. Great service amazing pizza delicious cocktails and a very authentic Italian experience. Highly recommended!" u"I really really wish I tried this place out in person instead of delivery because the pizza I ordered to my office one night was really sub-par (and I love pizza so it really hurts to write this)!\n\nIt was around 7 in the middle of the week and I was starving; the only solace that came to mind was a nice little personal pizza. I ordered off Yelp Eat24. I learned the hard way that Yelp reviews typically encompass dine-in experiences only. \n\nI had the Magherita Pizza. It was delivered after an hour 6 blocks away. The pizza base was very soggy and it was pretty cold. \n\nLike I said I wish I tried it in person to know the true taste and texture. I believe all of the reviews were pretty good but I'll have to come in one day to know for sure!" u"Every end of the summer my friend hosts a pizza crawl. This has been a tradition going strong for at least 6 years. This year we decided to do Hell's Kitchen. Mostly because he had a huge burning desire to try deep fried pizza. \n\nBeing stop number 1 we were all ravenous. I was more particularly excited because I knew I'd be cutting out of the crawl midway in between with other plans popping up. Was I impressed? No not really. The deep fried pizza was incredibly underwhelming. A more personal sized pizza than their much larger pies we went with two of the deep fried versions. One of which was a more traditional marinara with mozzarella and the other was kind of a black cabbage with mini raisins. The former was definitely better. The pizza dough was like any other soft and chewy but slightly more crisp and crunchier. I was left disappointed. The experience was 3 star pizza but I've had Don Antonio's before at a nearby friend's apartment for takeout and feel it was significantly better. Skip the deep fried pies and go with a regular sized one and load it on with fancy ingredients. It's a good traditional Italian spot but not something to put on a New York pizza crawl worthy expedition." u'An average pie. Deep fried pizza was really greasy/oily tasting. The crust was good on the "butcher" but the meats and sauce were bland.' u"Review number 1000! This is one of my favorite pizza places in all of Manhattan and it's true to Naples pizza style. The pistachio special pizza is one of the most amazing pizzas I've ever had - get it!" u"Don Antonio is hands down my favorite pizza restaurant in all of NYC! \n\nTheir staff is always friendly and helpful. Wonderful atmosphere great for a get together with friends family or even a date night.\n\nAmbiance is clean and inviting (I've dined at the bar and at a table).\n\nSome of my favorites are:\n- Fresh White Peach Bellini \n- Keste Pizza\n- Prosciutto e Arugula Salad\n- Margarita Pizza\n- Fried Pizza \n\nI rave about this restaurant to friends and can't wait to go back soon!!" u'In a word ...\n\nDisappointing.\n\nThe burrata appetizer was far too cold when it should have been room temperature.\n\nThe gluten free margherita pizza was far too dense not charred enough and the sauce and cheese were poorly portioned in ratio to the crust.\n\nService was slow to non-existent.\n\nP.S. The burrata was supposed to be truffle - yet there was zero truffle to be found. The saving grace? Management was "kind enough" to remove this disappointing appetizer from the final bill.' u"Keste's sister location and another of my New York standbys since it is so close to Port Authority. \n\nAfter walking around all day in the heat I needed some orange juice. Fresh made. No tartness with a nice hint of tanginess. It lacks the full-bodied notes of the juice one might get in Miami but I'd order it again. \n\nNow I got the Marinara pizza and the waitress made sure to warn me there was no cheese something I know full well. Deep red tomato sauce is spread over the dough with some basil leaves in the center. As the server puts the plate down heat is coming off the pie with the aroma of basil and leavened dough. So even before eating it I am already enjoying it. \n\nThe sauce is enhanced by oregano olive oil and some browned garlic. The crust indents when handling it is soft chewy yet has a nice crunchy texture on the bottom when you take a bite.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed especially considering the price point." u"Don Giovanni. Don Magnifico. Don Profondo. Don Geronio. The world of opera is filled with many a memorable don.\n\nThe equally inspiring world of authentic Neapolitan style pizza in Midtown presents only one don to rule them all: Don Antonio.\n\n(Did you see what I did there? I could have gone the mafioso route and named some dons but I'm trying to avoid glorying violence and the lifestyle of crime)\n\nMidtown is rife with pizza inequality. Dollar slice ghettos make out the pizza periphery for those late nights that we'd rather forget (and forget our choice in pizza).\n\nFor the person who prefers to spend slightly more dough for a vastly superior dough the personal pizza lunch specials at Don Antonio start at around $10. You'll be given both a lunch menu and regular menu during these hours of mid day gluttony. The main difference is in size- obviously the lunch pizza is smaller (and less expensive) than their dinner cousins.\n\nBut no less tasty or satisfying! I usually pair my pizza with a salad for an additional $3. The lunch pizza consists of four 'slices' that you can either eat by hand or chisel away at with a knife and fork. One of my favorite options is the keste pizza  (A name not unfamiliar in the annals of Neapolitan NYC pizza haunts).\n\nTomato sauce import buffalo mozzarella prosciutto di parma arugala pecorino gran cru basil and extra virgin olive oil make up this A-list of ingredients. When combined onto a canvas of dough the outcome is simply an edible opera for the taste buds.\n\nSpacing is tight and you will be packed in like sardines. If lunching solo or with another I recommend checking out the bar first. Or if pressed for time order takeout something I do almost weekly now. While you could always call your order in ahead of time I actually prefer going and ordering in person to have a little extra time to inhale the aromas of the interior and cast my eyes on the marvelous specimens of pizza perfection. Most normal people can just execute the more classical takeout method.\n\nOther standouts include the margherita that repeatedly proves the old adage that 'less is more'. Less ingredients less tastebud conflict less confusion less distraction and more purity of pizza. \n\nReadily available Peroni make for a fine complement to any order.\n\nI have yet to try the Don for dinner but the promise of montanarine appetizer (fried dough puff)  and a vastly expanded pizza menu calls for a corrective action shortly. \n\nSpare your self the Perillo tour of Italy the pickpockets of Naples and the jetlag: just go to Don Antonio." u"Great imported beverages. Unique items on the menu. The menu is very different so let the server explain things. The servers are wonderful and the manager/owner walks around and checks in with all the patrons. It is a refreshing experience.\n\nWe have the panna cotta for dessert after or pizza and fried pizza. We didn't leave hungry and would definitely be back." u"The pizza here used to be a taste of heaven. It was like a delightful throwback to my days living abroad in Italy. The staff members are really nice and even if there is a wait it's usually short. It does get pretty busy and it's not an intimate dining experience but it's worth the trip! I always order the pistachio e salsiccia - it's an acquired taste and not for everyone but I highly recommend it!!! I even had my local pizzeria try to replicate this pie a close second.\nIn my most recent trip end of August I have to say I was a little disappointed. \nI am only giving 4 stars because my burrata wasn't that good. It was too cold and not as delicious as the last time. Sad! Don Antonio is going down in quality."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
39.City Kitchen,[u"Every time I'm in the area I default to City Kitchen.\n\nBefore heading to a Halloween party nearby during a god awful hour I come to City Kitchen.\n\nIf I'm meeting a friend before they have dinner plans that do not include me I suggest City Kitchen.\n\nIf I'm with my younger cousin nearby and we want food options I come to City Kitchen.\n\nAfter a happy hour at a popular rooftop nearby I come to City Kitchen.\n\nMost of the time I head straight to the Ilili Box Counter and order the brussel sprouts. It is simply worth the $9 for a box of brussel sprouts made how they make it." u"City Kitchen is perfect for groups who are in the area and want a quick delicious bite. They offer a range of options ranging from ramen to burgers to donuts. A lot of NYC crowd favorites like Luke's Lobster and Kuro-Obi (part of Ippudo) are located here. Definitely something for everyone!\n\nMy only complaint is the seating situation (hence the 4-star rating). There are a few larger communal tables in the center and bar seating lined up against the large windows. From what I've noticed it's pretty much impossible to find a seat at the communal tables. There are always tourists occupying those spots for extended periods of time with their luggages and shopping bags. I'd be completely fine with the bar seating if it just weren't so sweltering hot in those seats. The sun shines against your face during lunch hours and I was roasting in the heat while eating my bowl of ramen. I think installing shades that can be lowered when necessary and turning up the A/C could really change this place from a 4 to 5-star establishment." u'I love this style of eateries where they have a floor or two with different vendors. Like a food court in the mall but with real food options not just MCD/panda or sbarro. \n\nI visited Ippudo and got their ramen and pork baos. It was so yummy! Theres plenty of seating to people watch. Location is in the heart of the city so love love love!' u"What a great food court option near Times Square! This was a couple blocks away from our hotel so it was a great option when we were unsure of where to eat. There is something for everyone! My parents came and enjoyed Kuro-Obi without me but I got to eat some Luke's Lobster and Dough on separate occasions. \n\nWhile I loved the selection of above average restaurants food court style I didn't appreciate the lack of seating. There were some counters lining the walls with hightop seats as well as tables to seat maybe 50 people tops. I didn't understand why there was so little seating for a food court by Times Square. In addition as a few other reviews have mentioned I would have loved to see this food court open a little later - higher quality late night options aren't super plentiful in the area. \n\nCity Kitchen is a great place to grab a quick bite without the fast food vibe. Just try to avoid peak meal times to ensure you can get a seat!" u'A mellow food court that is convenient for tourists and theater goers. As others noted this is not a large or upscale food court but it gets the job done. There were no stalls that I found to be new or different but my friends from out of town found something for both themselves and for their young kids. Prices as expected are a bit steep but the stalls all are clean and of good quality.' u'I was so excited to come here. My friends invited us here knowing that this was the best place to get a wide variety of food. It\'s located along the Theatre district near Times Square on the 2nd floor.\n\nIt\'s a food court of quality foods for those on the go or who want to sit casually. What makes this place unique is that it shares its restaurant with a hotel so u can have diversified seating and a diverse selection of foods. \n\nOn the other side of the food court where the hotel is connected is a stairway of carpeting lounge areas with floor seating and rectangular shaped cushions to lay down on. If I needed to eat and snooze. This place is perfect for a quiet area to clear your mind for the business of the city. Put in your headphones after your meal and take a 15 min. Break/nap! We need more of this!\n\nThey have a few large tables for those in groups or for studying. I just didn\'t like that there would be one person sitting in a huge table when other people can surely use the seating. Unfortunately I had my family of 6 along with my 2 friends. A table to sit 8 people is possible but with the many people eating it was a race to the table. I got lucky by requesting one table to inform me when they were about done so I could be next in line to seat our party. It wasn\'t bad while waiting since there was floor seating at the lounge while waiting.\n\nOnce you enter the food court. The smells hit you. Directly upon entering is a donut spot called Dough Donuts. They have Mexican. Japanese sushi burgers phillysteak ramen. But all I can tell u that I came for Kuro-Obi and Luke\'s lobster roll which is said to be ranked #1 in NYC. \n\nKuro-Obi: the cashier ordered everything for me except for my ramen. I wasn\'t thrilled when finding out she missed the fact I said I was ordering the kuro-obi ramen only to realize on my receipt she never inputted it.\n\nThe ramen was pricey but for nyc it\'s perhaps reasonable plus adding extra $2-3 for additional add-one each with egg pork and mustard greens. But I wasn\'t going to complain. I also got the Charsui bao with pork. It was different. More like a sandwich/taco take then how it is traditionally made. It was a winner. Edamame was a hit for the kiddos.\n\nWhitman\'s: cheeseburger and fries where good and reasonably priced. \n\nLuke\'s lobster roll: expensive for a small lobster roll. I needed to check out the craze. But the lobster was a small tease. Be prepared to pay $19. \n\nAll in all food court is perfect for grab and go and a place to casually eat. Kuro-obi ramen I highly recommend u not to miss.\n\nAdditionally CAUTION! Be aware the elevator runs "slowly" so caution yourself. My group got stuck in the elevator for 8 min. The help intercom Responded timely and we eventually had someone come to our rescue. Never has this happened to me in my life. Thankfully we weren\'t stuck for hours. Thank God cuz it became a sauna there with the amount of body heat in the small elevator. \n\nWhat an experience I\'d say?!' u"This is a nice food court with 7 different vendors with variety of chooses range from American Mexican to Japanese.  Clean and with plenty of seating.  Free wifi too.\nI only had the Yellow-belt ramen from Kuro-One so my review is only on Kuro-One. So here it goes:  \nI really want to give this place a 4-Star but I always evaluate by food quality quantity AND cost.  For me the food quality deserves a 4-Star - the ramen is not the traditional ramen I was expecting.  If you had traditional ramen at a authentic ramen house then you'd know what I mean.  The noodle is thinner straighter but still got the nice chewy/firm texture.  I'm a bit of a traditionalist so my preference is still the standard ramen - but I do like this ramen too (I know - it's complicated). The miso soup base is flavorful but a tad salty.  \nAs for quantity and cost - this is where I reduced it by 1-Star - the portion is half of what you would get at a typical Japanese noodle house in NYC but the price is about the same.  While I totally understand that given the area (theater district) the price is higher but my ramen bowl was $13 without anything add-ons.  If you want to add an egg it's $2 extra. I can see myself easily spending $30+ on lunch by ordering a little bit from each vendor.\nif I'm in a run and need a quick bite to each in the area I would come back here; but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here just to try the food out." u"This is the perfect place for me for a quick bite before a 2pm broadway show just a few blocks away. Normally I don't frequent the area much but its really nice they now have a nice new and clean food court right by the subway exit. I think most people vouched for the Kuro-Obi ramen stand and I was not an exception. Being that its from Ippudo the spicy ramen I got does taste quite similar to Ippudo's flavor. Although lacks the physical sophistication being served in a instant noodle bowl its served very fast and very tasty. It literally took only about a minute from when I paid to getting the bowl in my hand. The $12 for a bowl is a bit steep but considering the top prime location and the brand I wouldn't have expected it to be cheap.\n\nThe food I got from BOX was also quite nice although the wrap was probably a bit too heavy on the Korean sauce. But I really liked the falafal and its great that they provide the sauce on the side for the fries. I was a bit disappointed when they had threw away a perfectly edible brussels sprout side instead of the fries I ordered but I do appreciate how quickly they serve up the fries after I let them know the mistake. They work really fast in the kitchen here in City Kitchen.\n\nDefinitely a great spot for some quick food if you're in the area whether as a tourist or here for the Theaters. I'm very pleased on how clean they kept the dining area despite being such a high traffic area. Not sure if they have a minimum requirements on credit cards but very glad that they don't have a cash-only policy" u"Plenty of options to choose from. Have yet to try the ramen but I always go during lunch hour and I can't stand on that crazy line haha. Typically go to ilili box and get the duck shawarma but I want to try the duck and beef rice bowl soon. Portion wise it is a little small for $13 but hey I expected that from a touristy location." u"What a smart idea to have some of the most popular foods in one location; and in the heart of Times Square! \n\nHad family visiting and took them here. Conveniently located a block away from where they were staying (Marriott Marquis). Take the elevator up to City Kitchen and you will find a line of different vendors waiting for you. \n\nI had the spicy ramen at Kuro Obi. If you've been to Ippudo this place is affiliated. Same great taste with no reservation required. Only thing is they don't greet you like they do at Ippudo. The ramen was just what I needed on a cold NY day. \n\nFor dessert I bought my little sister a green tea ice cream at Snowday. Although they were out on most of their toppings I asked we still enjoyed this different style of ice cream.  \n\nToo bad Dough donuts was closed early we would've taken it to go. Next time!" u"If you want variety come here. Dropped off our luggage over at Rowe before we came to this gem and got some ramen in 80 degree weather. Later came back and got a chicken bowl couple stores down from the ramen place. Came back the day we left NYC and got donuts. They've got breakfast lunch and dinner covered." u"I stayed next door at Row NYC and this place is pretty freaking awesome. \nSo many food choices all in one place. I chose to go for Dough Doughnuts and Luke's Lobster.\nFrom Dough I got a passionfruit donut which was surprisingly delicious. \nFrom Luke's Lobster I got lobster bisque and a lobster roll which were both soooo good. There wasn't too much flavor to the lobster roll but it was definitely filled with huge fresh chunks of lobster meat so I can't really complain.\nThere are so many places to choose from in City Kitchen. I would totally make an effort to check this place out!" u"This place is awesome. Luke's Lobster Azuki sushi Whitman's Dough Doughnuts so many others all in one central location.\n\nNeed a quick bite to eat? Go here.\n\nWith a group of people (friends co-workers family you name it) that don't all want the same thing to eat? GO HERE NOW.\n\nNeed air conditioning to escape the heat of NYC? A break from being a tourist all day? A cool (temperature-wise) quick getaway from your office for lunch? I can keep going but this place has it all. Seriously where else will you find sushi ramen lobster quesadillas burgers and paninis in one place where you can all still eat at the same table?\n\nOkay a food court type place would suit those needs but this place is so much more than that.\n\nDefinitely recommend Azuki sushi they have great lunch and dinner deals. Luke's Lobster bisque was great have heard Whitman's burgers are fantastic and then you have countless other options if none of those strike your fancy. Plus Dough Doughnuts. I haven't had one yet but they catch my eye every time I'm walking out... one day." u"I loved my ramen ! Super tasty but I wish it wasn't so expensive. My bf and I came here and we each had ramen with an egg that we added to it. Two green teas. The bill ended up to 39$!!!! I was so shocked. It was 15$ each for our meal and and a couple dollars for\nOur drinks. But maybe I'll end up somewhere else a little Cheaper for what we got .." u"It's a nice place to chill before a show. Pricing or reasonable. There was plenty of seatings on a weekday." u"City Kitchen is an awesome option in the Times Square area especially if you and a small group of friends cannot decide what to eat.\n\nIf you're ok with the uncertainty of getting a seat and hovering over other eaters you can have a quick but satisfying meal before a show or as a central meeting place across the city. \n\nThe space is actually pretty clean and fellow diners were relatively respectful of lines and getting in people's way. \n\nThere's a lot of good representation here. On my most recent visit my group of 5 got food from Whitman's and Gabriela's and they were both good. \n\nThe stairwell up to the 2nd floor is horribly narrow so it might take a few shifts to get to where you are going. Bathrooms are in the basement but you can get to it from an elevator and they were actually pretty clean for Times Square.\n\nKeep this option bookmarked friends!" u'Great small food court in Times Square. Had a variety of food and a lot of places to sit. We had no issues dining here and would come again!' u"This is incredibly underrated and classy food court. I came on a weekend morning around 11 am and it was busy but not crowded at all. It is located in the heart of Time Square district but it is impervious to the absolute tourist madness right outside its doors. I felt so incredibly insulated and peacefully enjoyed my lunch in a brightly lit section of the dining area. The countertops are maintained well and cleaned often. The selection of vendors is fantastic: Dough (donuts) Kuro-Obi (Ippudo!!) Whitman's etc. \n\nI highly recommend dining here for a low key and scrumptious lunch or mid-day snack!" u"Really cool looking food hall-aesthetics wise-but there's like maybe 4 or 5 different vendors. Most of the business goes to Dough Doughnuts so if the place is packed it's because they still have donuts left.\n\nI genuinely love the idea of food halls; I plan on stopping at as many as I can to see which ones I'd like to frequent. But this place is expensive for small portions. I'd rather you go spend ur money at the Todd English Food Hall (near Central Park). They have endless choices of food and have bigger servings for the same price. \n\nBut if u plan on spending more than $13 on food the size of tapas then City Kitchen is perfect. \n\nSushi didn't look appetizing the lobster roll looked incredibly small it was too hot for ramen and I (unfortunately) settled for two tiny tacos that cost me $5-6 each. They had nothing inside the taco except the meat and topped it off with sliced radishes and cilantro... which I threw off because wtf lol\n\nDefinitely had high hopes for this place. Will not be back" u"Nice spot to chill and grab some ramen while visiting Times Square. It is very trendy but most importantly it's super clean and has a comfortable atmosphere. There are varying food options that revolve around Asian cuisine and hipster trends. I personally opted for ramen and was content. With the cold winter like winds blowing and the overcrowd streets of the city dining here is relaxing. The vibe is totally chill for families friends or lovers. \n\nI recommend eating here or just coming to chill out while you're in Times Square you'll escape into a tranquil setting among the tourist frenzy of the area."],0.2732,0.176,0.749,0.075
51.Cielo At the Mayfair,[u'First would like to start off by saying we have been on yelp and doing reviews for some time now and realized that giving a "5" star is not so easy to give and this restaurant let me refraze myself this gem of a small restaurant sure did impress us. \nMy husband and I were looking to have pizza and an appetizer  nothing too heavy to have before seeing a Broadway show this restaurant is located right next to the Eugene O\'Neill Theatre. \nOur server Giordano was spectacular. \nHe brought out some favorable bread and we decided on just tap water as our drinks which they bring out in mason jars ( love that touch) We decided on for an appetizer-Bruschetta Pomi Rucola so full of the flavors of garlic onions basil and fresh tomatoes and we shared a Margherita Pizza- nothing like a NY pizza crispy evenly spread with cheese. For dessert we shared a slice of cheese cake so creamy a perfect end to a delicious meal. \nSo yes "5" stars all the way.  Service spectacular. Giordano even held the door for us when we left you just don\'t see that any more. Quantity and quality of food is what will have us coming back when we have tickets to another show.' u"We went to this restaurant prior to a Broadway show. The restaurant is located below street level. The dining room is very comfortable. Has a nice grotto-esque feeling. At one end of the dining room is a large screen running continual video of scenes in Italy. The screen was kind of bright but it wasn't distracting at our table and it worked to help to transport you in a sense to Italy. Seating was close but not cramped. It wasn't busy. \nthe service was very attentive but they seemed to use a team approach where more than one person might come to your table to take an order or to serve you and your waiter wasn't the person to bring the meal. This resulted in us and others being asked twice by different people what we wanted for drinks and dessert. Maybe just a mixup among the staff and not a big deal. Worse and this may be a pet peeve of mine but I think it's a staple of good restaurant service when they brought the orders to the table the server has to stand there and ask who gets what. I think this is an unprofessional and amateurish way to serve in the restaurant. At a table of 2 I think they should be able to figure out who gets what based on who is sitting where when the order is taken. \nThe food was mostly disappointing   The calamari were badly overcooked and dry. I almost sent them back but my wife convinced me not to. The eggplant Rollatini was undercooked but otherwise had nice flavor. The grilled salmon which was one of the days specials but also seemed to be on the regular menu was overcooked and tasted fishy. My wife was kind enough to trade with me. She enjoyed the pommery mustard sauce. Unlike the other dishes the ravioli in mushroom sauce with sausage was excellent. \nI thought the chocolate mousse cake for dessert was the star of the show.\nIt was a nice experience but the food didn't live up to expectations . Sadly I don't think they were just off their game for the night. \nHaving spent $160 on a generally disappointing meal I think next time we are eating that early and the weather outside is nice I'll go around the corner to Donna Bell's bakery where everything is a showstopper and eat in the park down the street." u'We went out with our kids and my mother-in-law.  Food was very good and the prices very reasonable but what we were really happy about was the service from the host downstairs.  \n\nWe were initially seated upstairs but the upstairs is more of a bar feel than restaurant.  A party came in who was SO loud and since the bartender was also our waitress it was not going to be good. .  I was starting to get perturbed and we asked to move downstairs.  The host downstairs pushed an extra table by a booth - because my kids really wanted a booth - made sure we got a new basket of break etc.  They were great.  So I highly recommend this place esp but if its a romantic dinner or with kids eat downstairs. Much better ambience.' u"Quaint cozy grotto below street level. Service uneven mushroom ravioli fantastic penne way too spicy. Disappointed that a message to the restaurant about my husband's birthday dinner went unanswered and unheeded.  Salad misto was delectable.  Would return." u'This was a delightful surprise. The place is split into two. Downstairs there is a bar and upstairs there is a restaurant (with a bar). The restaurant was a small but comfortable size. \n\nI had dinner here and it was delicious. I ordered the ravioli. It was amazing. It was filled with cheese and was served with a mushroom rich sauce. I highly recommend it. It was also served with some bread.' u'Went to Cielo for a "pasta meal" before the NYC marathon trying to stay away from the touristy places.  Overall was disappointed in the quality of the food have had so much better in NYC.  The place has a nice quaint feel and service was generally pretty good but the food very mediocre.  Had orchiette with broccoli rabe there was hardly any kind of a sauce and not a whole lot of pasta.  Both kids had gnocci which was very mushy and the gnocci themselves had no substance just mush.  My wife\'s pasta dish was fine.  I wouldn\'t return here so many better options for Italian in the city.  The price was right...but wasn\'t worth the tradeoff of just so-so food.' u'Fair price for NYC dining. Authentic food and friendly staff.' u"I definitely give this place a 4 star rating. We ended up here because we were going to see Book of Mormon which is at The Eugene O'Neill practically next door so it was convenient.  Really glad we chose it.  The arugula salad was absolutely delicious & had the best goat cheese & beautifully ripe red tomatoes which are difficult to find this time of year. The vegan agnolotti with mushrooms & spinach were amazing too. I couldn't finish them but they were so good I had them wrap them up. Excellent friendly service & a cool atmosphere. I'd go here again even if I wasn't going to the theatre." u'Amazing food!  Housemade mozzarella and homemade pasta. Best salmon on the planet. Crispy outside and juicy inside!' u'Food and service was amazing. The ambiance was cozy which served as a surprising contrast to the New York City streets. \nThe only complaint we had was how hot it was down in the restaurant. There was no air flow and even though we went in October outside was still warm and the AC was completely turned off. \n\nThat being said I would still go back given the choice.' u'I happened upon this place by chance on my first night ever in New York City. It was a blessing!\nEVERY time I go back to NYC with all the amazing restaurants to choose from I always make a point to have one meal at the Cielo.\nAuthentic flavourful food. Fast efficient friendly service.\nPrices are great.\nI have nothing but the best memories here' u"So here we are back in NY two years later having dinner at Cielo's again.  If anything it's better than before.  So if you are around Time Square any want a reasonably priced really good dinner don't miss this place." u'Food was fine very enjoyable. Hubby had steak I had farfalle with salmon. Both fine. Dessert was a serious chocolate cake we shared. Chocolate martini was right on the mark. Service was quick and professional. Comfortable rustic dining room down a flight of stairs. Restroom is right there. We came because Book of Mormon is literally next door. Price was a little high but acceptable. Recommended!' u"5 stars for bar service. Came pre-book of mormon for a drink. You can pre-order intermission drinks!!!!\nBasically order & pay for ur drinks before the show starts. During intermission go to the bar & the bartender will serve your drink promptly. You can use the bar's restroom without waiting on a massive    Line. Have ur drink (which is much much cheaper than that served at the theater) & leave a tip before heading back to the show! Super fast since it's prepaid so no waiting to get ur checketc. and yes its legit. We walked in & the bartender knew what we had ordered. Its an amazing service! I highly recommend for pre-show and intermission drinks for the book of mormon." u"This was the best Italian meal we've had out in a long time!  The food was delicious the service was friendly the space was comfortable and the prices were reasonable for the Theatre District. I'm so glad we chose this place and would definitely return!" u"Generic food. Nothing special. Drinks not great either. I sat in their upstairs section. Wasn't a nice area. There is a preorder pizza bar inside. Very odd. Wouldn't recommend it" u'Great place for Breakfast Lunch or Dinner. \nThe staff is wonderful and the food is delicious! \nClose to many Broadway theatres.' u'Good Italian restaurant near theater district.\nThey do not really have a wide variety of menu but every meals are reasonable and tasty. Caprese and chicken were nice and not salty!' u"My mom & I were able to make last minute dinner reservations here before a show. Overall the food was good - they had a pretty extensive menu with a ton of options. However I remember it taking a really long time to get our food so we were concerned about being late for the show. My mom ordered a soup and we shared a salad and a pasta dish.\n\nThe vibe was a bit too dungeon-like for me - not really what you'd expect from an Italian restaurant. You walk downstairs into the basement and it's incredibly dark with wood paneling everywhere. With such a great location in the theater district they could definitely do a lot more down there to class it up a bit. \n\nOverall if you're looking for a place in the theater district with solid food I'd recommend it. However if you're trying to take someone out for an enjoyable dinner with a nice atmosphere this definitely isn't my first recommendation." u"Great food very savory. Host is very attentive.glad we stopped by. Next time you're at broadway check it out."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
157.China Xiang,[u'We went as a party of 5 and got the spicy dry pot for 2 (abt 9 ingredients which definitely can feed more than 2 ppl) and 2 entrees (a spicy beef dish and a sour fish dish). The food took a while to come out but they were all really good so worth the wait.\n\nThis place has a no tipping policy so i was slightly worried about what the service would be like BUT the waiters were very attentive and our waters were always filled up promptly.' u'I was visiting Times Square and found this restaurant via Yelp. First off - kudos to the Yelp community!\n\nThis restaurant was clean interesting and the staff was friendly. I\'ve enjoyed Chinese Thai Vietnamese Korean and Filipino food for years however this restaurant had some seriously "authentic dishes". I suppose I\'m too used to the "Americanized Chinese food" I\'ve grown up with. I did a double-take when I looked at the menu: "OX Tongue and Tripe Roasted Chili Peanut Sauce" and "Spicy Pork Intestine in Casserole". These aren\'t items I\'ve seen on a Chinese menu during my time living on the American West Coast or in the American Southwest. I mean I like to celebrate diversity but this was a little too broad for me. \n\n***I recommend wearing your reading glasses when looking at the menu and also you might not want to order intoxicated as you might get a surprise.***\n\nNow for the "Millennials" reading this review please DO NOT feel "micro-aggressed" - I mean no disrespect for the menu options I just listed. It\'s just not for me at this time.\n\nI instead opted for a bottle of Tsingtao beer a small cup of Wonton soup and the delicious "Sauteed Sliced Lamb Cumin Flavor". The portion size was a little small but then again I like to eat big. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to family and friends.' u"Absolutely the best Chinese food my husband and I have ever had. Amazing. Nothing wrong at all with the food. Every time my husband and I visit NYC this will be our go too. \n\nTheir machine doesn't take tip must tip in cash." u'After much trial and error to find this place it was well worth it. The whole establishment was filled with local folks speaking Chinese but luckily menu was in English as well. We ordered the braised pork rib rice noodles and the salt and pepper shrimp....delicious!  Plenty for 2 to share and food was fresh and served with a smile. Good job Yelpers!' u'Deeeeelicious! \n\nI went with a party of three and everything was delicious. We ordered the mapo tofu crispy beef Chinese broccoli and this bowl of spicy oil filled with spam tripe blood and sausage. \n\nWe finished everything on our table. \n\nEverything was so flavorful. The crispy beef was so sweet and thinly sliced- perfect balance to all the savory spiciness in the other dishes we ordered. \n\nI also ordered a plum juice which balanced the heat from all the spicy dishes too. \n\nHighly recommend this restaurant!!! Really great food. Will be coming back here.' u'Ordered $30 ma la Xiang guo got a small box of vegetables and few piece of meat  such a rip off . Called the restaurant only answer from them is that the price is rising. Terrible customer service. There are so many good Sichuan restaurants in the city will tell everyone that I know to stay away from this place' u"Let me preface this review with this is NOT American Chinese!  If you are looking for beef and brocoli and egg rolls this might not be your spot.  I love trying new things honestly I do but I'm not a big frog fan and they have a LOT of frog on the menu.  The wait staff didn't seem too interested in helping me either but eventually found their way over to my table.  It was very busy with people coming and going constantly and VERY loud!  Once they took my order the food was out pretty quickly and the service improved.  I had jumbo shrimp with garlic and spicy salt which was very good especially teamed with the chili oil and soy.  Also the seating is VERY tight.  If you are by yourself don't expect to sit at a big table without people around you :-)  Yelpers weren't wrong about this spot...very good!" u'We needed a good Chinese restaurant for a meal with visiting friends from China following a Broadway musical.  Although the service was quite indifferent and the bathroom was dirty the food was rather tasty.  Our friends from China were so pleased with the dishes that they came the next day for another meal.' u'I did not expect anything from this store especially because my friends described it as a little "shady". However that is clearly not the case and this place is AMAZING. I didn\'t order too much but what I did order satisfied me immensely. \n\nI ordered the egg drop soup and the dry pot. \n\nThe egg drop soup was very normal not anything special and definitely could have been warmer. Didn\'t like or dislike this. \n\nThe dry pot however was SO GOOD. If you travel all the way to flushing for malaxianguo and are looking for a closer alternative in the city look no more!! \nMy friend and I ordered the dry pot at medium spicy (which was very doable for someone who is very sensitive to spice) with broccoli fish fillet tofu skin enoki mushroom and black Mushroom ear. The portion isn\'t huge but good for two people to finish. It was REALLY good with all the right spices and not too salty or oily. It comes with a bowl of rice too.\n\nDefinitely come here for the dry pot!!!!' u'I went here again during lunch time with 2 other people. We all had the lunch special...soup and a main dish for about $10 each. We tried both hot & sour soup and egg drop soup and both were good.\nWe had 3 different main dishes-sliced fish chicken and pork. Each of us thought our dishes were excellent. \nThis place is great and highly recommended. The food is wonderful and in midtown Manhattan I can think of few other places with food of this quality at this cost. Run do not walk!' u"Located by 42 st...super legit. I thought all the legit places were located chinatown but this is place is really good! REALLY FLAVORFUL!!\n\nWe got the pork with veggies the sauce is on point! It's the black sauce. We also got this spicy soup thing with noodles and fish. The dishes are pretty authentic but they do also make dishes for Americans that like chinese american food like orange chicken. I would def come back- the food comes out pretty quick and the place was packed for dinner. \n\nhidden gem in midtown west!\n\n\nNo need to tip  it's included. I know some people complain about this but I actually think it's a good concept. Service is pretty good!" u"Came here for dinner during Chinese New Years. The place was pretty packed but we were only two people so we got seated right away. The larger groups had to wait a bit.\n\nIt's Hunan cuisine and pretty authentic too compared to some of the other places in Manhattan. It's definitely surprising to see such a high quality Chinese restaurant in the middle of Hell's Kitchen area or basically any place outside of Chinatown. It's a little pricier than what you would see in Chinatown but it's not that bad.\n\nWe got the cabbage with pork belly beef and green chilies and the whole steamed fish with peppers. Everything was delicious! The first two dishes came out in about 10 minutes but the fish took longer about 30 minutes though that's typical especially for such a busy night. The host was very friendly and gracious and the waitress was helpful as well. Service overall was speedy and efficient. It was definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city for authentic cuisine!" u'Very yummy regional Chinese food. Friendly and fast service. Got my seats for 2 or 7 very quickly too. I would go to this place again. Great place if looking for good Asian food near the 42nd st movie theatres or Port Authority.' u'Pretty authentic Chinese food near times square those Hunan rice noodle are awesome! Especially loved the ones with the sour beans which is a Hunan specialty.' u"Great food and service!  We will come again!  Close to Times Square but not many tourists were here. Lots of locals which means it's good. We loved it!" u'We were impressed! And found it very interesting there was a no tipping sign.\n\nTried a classic Hunan rice noodles dish with sour string bean and minced pork.\nHusband tried the dry pot with pork belly beef meat stuffed fish balls mushrooms and bean sprouts.\nEverything was truly delicious.\nPlus the service was terrific! \nWe were seated promptly around 7pm on a Thursday night but it was pretty packed. The waitress was patient & kind as was the rest of the wait staff (I felt they were eager to please and would easily smile when making eye contact).  Our water glasses were never empty. \n\nAlso the folks this restaurant draws seem vibrant and fellow foodies. We sat next to a couple who when asked what their tasty looking dish was insisted on giving us some to try. We ended up having some good conversation.' u'This place is amazing! As a family we eat Chinese food often and this by far is our new spot in New York! Jeff the waiter and possibly the owner gave exceptional service and was on top of our every need! The food is top of the line as well! The eggplant dish was like nothing we have ever had! We may even come back before vacation is over! We definitely recommend this place!' u'Interesting location for an authentic Chinese restaurant.  Price is pretty decent considering this busy touristy area of town.  Extra Star to the restaurant for not "Americanizing" the dish too much.\n\nThis place is often crowded due to the relatively small size and also its one of the few real Chinese places in the area.  Many of the dishes are very spicy and oily and not recommended for those with sensitive highbrow taste buds.  One of the great things about restaurant like this is that the foods are the main attraction and not the pretentious "ambiance".' u"I stopped by China Xiang for lunch with a couple of coworkers having walked by the restaurant several times before. We opted to share three dishes off the lunch special family style: the kung pao chicken eggplant and double-cooked pork belly with tofu. This came with a soup and bowl of white rice per dish. \n\nOf the three dishes the eggplant was probably the best. Overall I found the flavors of the dishes somewhat muted. I didn't quite get much spice from the kung pao chicken and the pork belly and tofu failed to shine. This was shocking especially for a so-called Hunan restaurant a cuisine known for its spices and aromas.\n\nLooking at other reviews it appears China Xiang boasts a mean dry pot so I will have to give that a try. For now it only earns three stars from me." u'Had a really good meal with decent service. They were a bit rush-y cause we were coming close to their closing time. Pretty understandable.\n\nI enjoyed the pigs feet more than I thought I would. We had the malaxiangguo (dry spicy hot pot). I thought the price was awesome for a sit down restaurant on 42nd St. You get 10% off for paying in cash and you are not obligated to pay tax! Definitely a pleasant change.'],0.7184,0.857,0.143,0.0
46.Nino’s 46,[u"Great quality food with lots of flavor! Coming from Miami I will surely be back next time I'm in NYC!\n\nTry the truffle mac and cheese bites!" u"I'm very pleasantly surprised and frankly shocked that I enjoyed dinner so much at Nino's. It's not billed as a fancy Italian place but I had such a good experience that I dare say it's even better than one of those fancy trendy Italian restaurants in the LES or LWS. My friend and I ordered the spaghetti with chicken parm ($20) and the green pizza pie ($18). I didn't try any of the pizza but my buddy said it tasted good.\n\nThe chicken parm was amazing! I was seriously surprised at how much food I got for the price. The way the noodles are played makes it look like there isn't much (which wouldn't surprise me because most Italian places are like that) but once you move them around you see how much there really is. The noodles were also cooked excellently (i.e. al dente). The chicken parm was also delicious -- there was a nice crunch from the breading and the chicken was decently thick so it didn't feel like I was being ripped off.\n\nWhile the waiters were friendly and the service was good I will say that two detractions are that the restaurant is extremely dark and the tables are suuuuuuper small. Seriously I had to use the candle on the table to read the menu (a small exaggeration but would be true if I had worse eyesight). Other than these two minor nits I'll definitely keep Nino's in mind for Italian!" u"Our visit to Nino's started off a little rocky. We made a reservation on Open Table for about 8pm. We arrived and a large party had taken up most of the tables.  I told the host/guy standing near the front of the restaurant that we had a reservation to which he brusquely replied that they didn't have any tables but the bar was open. Apparently a reservation in NYC means that if you fit you sit--there's your reservation. To me this wasn't the worst thing in the world (at least we got a seat) but my wife (first timer in NYC) wasn't terribly happy with the lack of table. Fortunately once some tables opened up they were happy to move us to one and that took care of that.  \n\nApart from the table incident the rest of the meal was a delight and food was delicious. Out here in Colorado we don't get a ton of homemade pasta so it was pasta bliss at Nino's." u"Had to try this place after seeing how good a coworker's pizza looked after she ordered it the day before. It came highly recommended by her. \n\nGot the food delivered and it came incredibly quick especially for the fact that our order included three individual pizzas. \n\nThe menu has some pretty interesting combinations for their pizzas which comes as thin style. After some internal debate (everything sounded good!) I selected the 'Nduja - homemade mozzarella calibrian chili honey and 'nduja (a spreadable pork salumi). It had such an amazing savory flavor with fantastic crust. The clili's also added a nice spicy zest. \n\nTried a piece of of Green Pie (artichoke kale pesto mozzarella and goat cheese) and it was great as well! But the 'Nduja was definitely our favorite between the two pies." u"Food was spectacular! For starters we had the truffle mac and cheese balls - amazing! Their watermelon cocktail was so refreshing and deliciously strong. \n\nI had the shrimp and lobster linguine which was a such a huge serving I actually couldn't finish it. The device throughout he night was wonderful. Everyone on the staff was super nice and attentive." u"The penne alla vodka was DELICIOUS! I've had it twice now and it was amazing both times - the sauce is delicious and the pasta is cooked just right. I've had penne alla vodka at quite a few places and this tops my list! \n\nAnd don't get me started on the truffle Mac and cheese bites.... they were phenomenal!!!\n\nI've come here with coworkers twice for lunch - the first time with 11 people and the second with 12 people. If you call in the morning they may be able to accommodate a large group. As others mention it is a small space. I can't imagine them being able to take reservations for two large groups at once but definitely happy they've been able to accommodate us both times! I will continue pushing this as a lunch spot when we need a place to go as a group :) \n\nIt is a smaller place but don't let that fool you - we were all very happy with the food! And for the amount of food we ordered the cost was definitely reasonable!\n\nPS - their dinner menu does not have penne vodka. I was very very sad when we came for dinner one night after I was craving their penne vodka all day :( the spaghetti and meatballs was a good substitute but not the same!!" u"Having just arrived in the city we were getting hungry and we had the little ones with us and they were asking for pizza so we settled in on Nino's.\n\nImmediately walking in we were greeted and seated right away during the lunch hour. Quaint spot with an upscale feel but comfortable enough for young ones too. Kids wanted pizza but given the craft style choices the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef to make a margherita pizza for the kids.  We split the Penne Vodka and that is a must dish to order. Prices were moderately higher than most but the quality matched the price of the dishes. Centrally located and walking distance from The Roosevelt Hotel." u"Situated directly across from our hotel and a hankering for Italian comfort foods this was the perfect spot.\n\nThe con: the smells.\nWe arrived early a bit before 5:30 and the place reeked of cleaning solution. We were too tired to look for somewhere new and decided to stick it out! The open kitchen also let out some strange fumes during the course of the meal perhaps a cooked green that isn't the best to smell. \n\nThe pro: atmosphere and quick service\nMinus the scent the place is adorable inside and not what you would expect from seeing the front door. Really cute bar area and enough space at the tables. \nSince we arrived so early we had quick service and food nearly immediately. \n\nThe food: was good. Not out of this world rock your socks off but fair and homey and comforting. The best part was the after taste of the spaghetti sauce some sort of sage herb or type of basil but a really nice flavor. \n\nTo note to the managers: I wish I had been offered Parmesan and pepper!! I would have liked to add a little of both." u'We came here on the last day of 2016 but it was totally full. Finally got a chance to check this place out this time!! \n\nThe pasta was great! I ate it all and the portion was really big. The coffee was also fantastic. The inside was not bright but the atmosphere was relaxing. The only problem is that it is not very spacious and you might got the smell of food on your coat!' u"Had a great experience here!\n\nI like the atmosphere and ambiance but - more importantly - the food!  I started with the fried burrata (can't go wrong with that) and had the spaghetti with meatballs as an entree.  The spaghetti was amazing - one of the best I've ever had.  \n\nService was also great.  I wish I could remember the name of our waiter as he was very friendly and attentive.  The owner stopped by our table after our meal who was also very nice. \n\nI'll be back soon!!" u'The spaghetti and meatballs are AMAZING! Had the special bursts salads with heirloom tomatoes and strawberries it was to die for! Definitely be back!' u"The food here is good especially if you are gluten sensitive as they can substitute gluten-free pasta into their dishes. The chef/owner of Nino's is celiac himself so you can trust they take gluten-free seriously.\n\nI really enjoyed my Nino's Drunken Chicken Parm Sandwich: the chicken vodka sauce basil and mozzarella came together amazingly well. \n\nWhen we came in the place wasn't very busy but service was very curt. I don't normally take issue with this but when the automatic 20% gratuity came on our bill it left a sour tinge on an otherwise very pleasant meal." u"I'm visiting for work from Dallas which is a place that doesn't have many local fresh classic Italian spots so I decided to venture to Nino's 46 for dinner. The interior decor was dark romantic and narrow just like the Italian spots I missed from when I lived on the East coast.\n\nThe food here is incredible and reasonably priced.  I started with the Tuscan Kale Salad and wanted to lick the plate after I finished because it was so delicious (don't worry I refrained from doing so). My entree was the Orecchiette was creamy and pesto-y and I absolutely loved the fresh pasta and fresh Italian sausage. The food reminded me of Italy Italian rather than American Italian.\n\nWhere did Nino's 46 fall short? Two things. First I am by no means a wine snob but if you're only going to offer one Pinot Grigio at least make it a decent one. Also the bartender with long straight black hair was the most miserable person I've ever encountered in NYC. She was cold short-tempered and communicated with her customers and coworkers as little as possible. The manager would ask her for a whiskey sour twice for one of the tables and she wouldn't even acknowledge his request - she just gave him a dirty look. Yikes hopefully she was just having a bad day!" u"Loved this place. As you walk into it you pretty much are walking out of the loud city into the calmness and comforting place. \n\nI had the Baby Lettuces salad and the eggplant parm served over spaghetti. It was perfect. The portions are huge and well priced. Can't wait to be back." u"We came here kinda out of the blue but it was a pleasant surprise. We were craving pizza and pasta and this place killed it in both departments. \n\nWe got the Fettuccine and mozzarella and basil pizza. The portions were small enough that we weren't limited to sharing one dish but large enough that we were perfectly satiated. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The lobster and shrimps were perfectly tender. The pizza was thin and full of flavor. We also were able to fit in the truffled mac and cheese balls which were soooooo good. The truffle really gave it an extra kick. \n\nThe atmosphere was great with the candles and dimly light areas perfect for a cute date! I would definitely come back!" u"Franco the owner and head chef couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly. When we arrived early for our reservation he welcomed us with wine while we waited for our table. He chatted with us and gave suggestions when we asked about his menu. He even offered a margarita pizza while we waited. Once seated our waiter memorized all 6 of our orders and everything was delicious and freshly prepared. We definitely recommend Nino's 46 and will be back!" u"We ordered's from Nino's 46 for a team work lunch and it was really good!\nI tasted the mac and cheese balls which were delicious! The chicken parm was great too. I usually avoid the spaghetti part but this time I just couldn't resist.\nDelivery was prompt and the food came hot.\nI ordered a Caesar salad but didn't realize it came with pancetta. Unfortunately I won't be able to eat it but luckily I am extremely satisfied from my other courses!\nWould definitely be a returning customer. The rest of my team appeared equally as satisfied!" u"Both my mom and i LOVED ninos. It's great Italian food for a reasonable price. We started off with the kale salad which ended up being so delicious and flavorable with the pine nuts then ordered the spinach pasta which ended up not looking or tasting like we expected but was still amazing. Then we finished off with the Nutella bread budding which was the perfect end to our meal!" u'The good: gluten-free option vegetarian pizza open late. There are a few TVs so it\'s a great place to grab a slice and watch some of a game. \n\nThe not so good: you can\'t split a small with 2 toppings so they force your to buy a large pie the pie could have been a little more cooked they forgot the artichokes on the "veggie and artichoke" pie and the place is full of cheesy Italian decor. \n\nOverall I\'d come back in for a late night snack.' u'Food and service were great for a tasty and quick lunch in midtown! Ordered the Alfredo pasta with lobster and shrimp seafood was fresh and pasta was homemade. Came out to table within 10mins was able to finish my lunch and have enough for a second serving in leftovers.'],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
183.Bouchon Bakery,[u"Went in to get a little snack. If you're looking for gluten free macaroons they got them here.\n\nI had the pistachio one and it was very good. They also sell salads soups coffee and breads. It is a bit on the expensive side but I think it's definitely worth it. Inside is beautiful; but my phone battery was running very low(10%). I did take a picture while outside but it came out tacky as I was rushing.\n\nIt just had a very relaxed vibe inside; I could easily stay there during an evening on my laptop and eating something light. Will be back!" u'I was visiting from LA. When I got JFK in the early morning I went directly to Bouchon Bakery.\nI am a huge fan of Chef Thomas Keller and his restaurants in NY LV SF and LA. He always meet my expectations. Never ever disappoint me. \nThe bakery is located at the Rockefeller center. Fancy interior friendly customer service tasty sandwich and wonderful sweets! Everything GREAT! I loved them all :)' u"Came here because Thomas Keller is obviously a god. The shop was quaint and employees were very friendly and efficient. I tried the pistachio macaron and the chocolate chip cookie. When it comes to macarons size definitely matters the macarons are HUGE! I loved the subtle pistachio flavor but they were a bit too crumbly possibly just a touch over baked but delicious none the less. As for the cookie again they don't skimp on size! Nice and crispy outside but soft and chewy inside. There were what I think were small chocolate shavings and also large chocolate chunks so there was a really nice amount of chocolate all throughout the cookie which was a very nice touch! \n\nOverall were they the best cookies/macarons I've ever had? No. But still yummy for a quick treat. I don't think I'd go back though with so many other options in NYC." u"Short of flying over to France I would make this trip - even if it's a tad out of the way because it is worth the time and effort! Everything is amazingly good but my personally favorite is the croissants." u"The bakery is located on the corner near the Rockefeller center. \n\nI came here mid day to grab some coffee and pastries.\n\nI got a small cold brew which was great and a Bouche brownie which was bomb- so delicious!\n\nI also got a coffee cake and Danish pastry to go. The coffee cake is amazing- highly recommend trying it. It's has more chocolate flavor than coffee flavor. The danish was good as well.\n\nThe service was great- the cashier was friendly and recommended me what pastries are the best. \n\nThey have both indoor as well as outdoor seating available- it's limited though.\n\nThey don't have guest bathrooms." u"My co-workers and I split a bunch of small treats for a mini celebration and the dessert feast was delicious. \n\nI'd highly recommend the chocolate eclair the large chocolate chip cookies and the tarts but the mini brownie was pretty good too. We regretted not trying their macaroons because they looked really good and were definitely larger than the typical macaroon. \n\nOnly thing that I wasn't impressed with at all was their Oreo cookie. It was very dry and nothing like an Oreo. \n\nFinally I would certainly recommend eating all desserts with a tall glass of milk!" u"Love the macarons here! Not extremely sweet just perfect. And the others pastries are very good too (the oh oh the Oreos and the puff with the delicious cream inside don't remember the name)" u'I have only ever been to Bouchon in Yountville CA-so I had extremely high expectations going in. While this bakery is twice the size-it had half the options. \n\nThe staff seemed shocked by everything we ordered and my treats left something to be desired.' u"The bakery items were delicious but don't bother getting any of the breakfast sandwiches with egg. It looks like it's made from plastic..." u'It is just as tasty here in NY as it is back home in Northern California. I got the pistachio macaroon (one of my favs) and the mother in law got some oatmeal cookies. Both were delicious and a perfect pick me up as we were walking along enjoying the sunshine!' u'Got an iced vanilla latte pumpkin muffin.  Wife got the last almond croissant. Everything looks amazing and taste good' u"A really cute place that has sandwiches beverages and pastries like macaron eclairs croissants. \n\nRaspberry Macaron -- these macarons are giant compared to every other place I've gotten them. It's about the size of my palm. But not a fan of this filling -- it had both some kind of buttercream that lacked any discerning flavor as well as a raspberry jam filling. I wanted something fruity and lighter (in taste not necessarily calories) and the cream felt pointless and added a heaviness to the cookie. \n\nChocolate Macaron -- a rich chocolate ganache filling. Can never go wrong with chocolate! \n\nChocolate eclair -- in spite of it being a rich dessert this happens to have a certain lightness to it even some bitterness from the dark chocolate ganache/glaze on top to round out the sweetness. Was surprised that it was chocolate filled. There was a lot of cream to pastry ratio but was good. The glaze must have been a higher percentage dark chocolate because it was significantly more bitter than semi-sweet chocolate or even 60-70%. The glaze was hardened and thick and I appreciated the fact it did not smudge on the paper bag or melt. Nothing worse than coming home to a destroyed looking pastry. Presentation was really amazing. \n\nCroissant -- my husband thought this was the best croissant he has had. At first I thought there was something wrong with this croissant because he stopped eating midway. But he was really amazed at how buttery it was. He was used to the croissants from casual morning food carts and those didn't have any flavor to them. This was buttery airy flaky and he enjoyed every single bite! \n\nThe people taking your orders were quick and efficient but didn't offer much in terms of customer service. There is a line consistently so and they need to keep things moving so I understand this. The cashier seemed a bit unfriendlier but I also think they get so busy they have to just focus on matching the orders to the correct person. He didn't even really look up offer eye contact or a quick smile or nod. But whatever I don't come here to chit chat. \n\nI did feel a little rushed to order as in you need to quickly figure out what you want by the time you are able to glance at the display. However it's a little challenging because you can't really look at everything without actually being on the line and you can't exactly step around others giving their orders since they're blocking your view. It's also a bit of a narrow space because right next to where the line forms there is a center display of drinks like bottled soda.  \n\nIt's not do or die but if there is a line probably not a good idea to hem and haw for ten years over what you want to order. I quickly picked a few good staples and was on my way!  \n\nInterior feels spacious with high ceilings/ white tiling that feels modern but then they have beams that give it a rustic feel. Definitely a welcoming vibe in terms of their decor. If there was more seating I would have stayed and did some good ol' fashioned people watching. \n\nThey have seats along the window so you can do said people watching -- and it's a great location to do so! The outdoor seating while limited and small seems quaint private and cozy because of the high trimmed bushes they have around the perimeter. Because of this they create a charming sense of peace and leisure that is not easily found in Manhattan." u"Rockefeller Center has so many gems in its jewel box.  But Bouchon Bakery was particularly appreciated being familiar & a welcomed reminder of back home.  \n\nI felt almost proud seeing Napa represented proper.  Thomas Keller spreading all that pastry love on the other side of the country...\nThat man really can do no wrong.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop w the pastry love.  The coffee that is served at the flagship Bouchon Bakery in Yountville is Equator.  It turns out Equator is the coffee Mr. Keller chooses to serve at ALL his properties nationwide.  \n\nEquator Coffee is based in Oakland CA.  So Oakland is in the house too.\n\nThis was the perfect spot for a mid afternoon pick-me-up.  I only wished there were more seating.  If I recall correctly there were a few stools along the window & that was it.  Or were they standing?  Either way standing room only inside was a very nice & necessary respite from walking around the streets of NYC in the near freezing cold.\n\nDelicious & a classic in any city.\n\n4 stars." u'Loveeeeee the macarons.... hate the crowd but so worth it! \n\nI can\'t believe it took me over 10yrs to stop by... worked in midtown in my early 20s... probably couldn\'t afford these pricey treats with a crappy new grad salary.. LOL\nNow a little older taste buds are more mature - finally made it to Bouchon... (although I have eaten at their restaurant in Vegas) and now I\'m a super fan of the Macarons... so light fluffy and airy... simply amazing! \n\nSomething about how they make their fillings... it just blows you away... compared to those other "pretty much" copy versions... you can absolutely taste the difference in quality.  Swing by when you\'re in this "crowded tourist" madness... again sooo worth it! \n\nEnjoy!' u"Definitely a bit of a tourist trap given its location but if you time it well you can be in and out in about 10 minutes. Despite the line and tight space the flow of people was pretty fluid. Good luck getting a seat if you want to stay a while though. \n\nI had such an amazing Bouchon experience in Las Vegas so I wanted to check out my go-to: chocolate almond croissant ($4.95). The flavors were definitely there and the distribution of almond and chocolate inside was thorough. However the outer flaky layer was a little too hard and did not taste as fresh as the Las Vegas Bouchon's. Then again this is still one of the best chocolate almond croissants in NYC so it's definitely worth checking out if that's your thing." u'Hard to go wrong with baked goods and coffee!  Located right across from the Today Show and Rockefeller Plaza it should satisfy any need for that morning cup of joe!  The bacon cheese and egg croissant was nice and the croissant was fluffy!' u"i ordered a latte and a pistachio macaron. latte wasn't great. There are much better choices of places near by for coffee. but if you are looking for the baked stuff i would say ypu got the right place!! I always try macaron if a bakery has one. and so far i liked laduree the best. i wouldn't dare say that one place is better than another but i loked macaron here too. and it was pretty big in size which anyone would appreciate.\nall the other baked goods looked amazing. I'm just upset that i didn't have enough space left in my stomach to try them all.\ni think it'sdefinitely worth going back and trying other ones.\nit's right across street from Rockefeller center and ypu can view street from the window seat. it was surprisingly quiet inside.\nthere are some outdoor seating - not much inside though." u"It's a trap!\n\nDon't come expecting anything awesome. I asked for my coffee a particular way. That didn't happen. And it wasn't particularly busy on a Sunday morning. (When we walked in there was no line.) \n\nWhen I asked for a refund the guy tried to keep my receipt. (We keep them for business expenses.) \n\nThe sandwich my other half ordered the tuna ni\xe7oise wasn't particularly good. He said the quality of tuna wasn't very good. We have a fabulous French cafe in the town we live in that does a far better version. (Better tuna.)  I've had better croissants elsewhere. This one wasn't particularly good. \n\nWe've dined at Bouchon for dinner. I've had takeaway sandwiches at the Bouchon Bakery from Columbus Circle. This was our first breakfast encounter it was a complete disappointment." u"Bouchon is my favorite spot for an afternoon treat in the area. The cafe is small and often crowded especially because it is in the heart of Rockefeller Center but the staff always keeps the line moving. It's very difficult to find a spot inside and I wish they had more seating. However there are some tables outside- just watch out for pigeons! \n\nI've had several of the baked goods and everything has been great! I love the banana bread which is always so buttery and moist. They also have extra large macaroons which are delicious! Of course you also can't go wrong with their lattes and cappuccinos." u"I was bumming around Rockefeller Center looking for a way to go down to the sub-cellar mini mall and I spot a Bouchon cafe with outdoor seating.  Well you know my sweet tooth wants me to go and and check out the yummiest dessert and I do.\n\nBeside the coffee drinks and  desserts such as raisin buns baklava danish cookies and a few cakes and macarons they also carry sandwiches and salads.  It's small inside and they have a few high stools facing the big picture glass windows so you can sit and watch the passer by outside. The outside seating has about 5 tables under big umbrellas and protected by a privacy hedge so you can easily avoid the tourist walking around the outside in semi-privacy.\n\nI picked out a chocolate cream parfait which had a crispy crumb center with chocolate pudding on the bottom and whipped cream on top with tiny milk chocolate bits in it.\n \nI also got their coffee table size  cookbook but you need a full stocked kitchen with baking tools and a convection oven to cook most of the breads and desserts.    :-(."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
188.Maoz Falafel & Grill,[u"Yowza! In honor of the Jewish new year (Rosh Hashana) I decided to eat here for lunch. \n\nTheir pitas are fresh and chewy. I usually don't eat much bread but this was excellent. The felafel balls were fresh not oily. I added avocado feta lettuce and tahini sauce. \n\nMy husband ordered a salad with grilled chicken hard boiled egg beets chick peas and slaw. \n\nThey have a good variety of drinks--sodas bottles just up the street since 1891! \n\nBar seating or takeout. Fast fresh option." u"Realized that I had been going to the other location of Maoz all along. Finally stopped by this location and tbh I think I like the other more cramped Times Square Maoz better. The broccoli/cauliflower mix here was 90% broccoli and it wasn't cooked to that burnt crispness that makes roasted broccoli/cauliflower so great. The hummus also underwhelmed at this location too much sub par tahini flavor and the chicken shawarma was a bit dryer. \n\nOn the upside they have a red pepper side here that I have never seen at the other location. And there's much more space to eat. \n\nMaybe it's because the other location gets more foot traffic so things are fresher but just generally think that this location's food is inferior to the other." u"Being on 8th ave right across from the Westin I was super excited since it had great ratings and looked really cheap too. Unfortunately for a myriad of reasons I was left wanting more and being a little disappointed with my overall experience.\n\nWalking in I was excited with the set up. Menu was very simple pretty reasonably priced. A typical build your own type of set up where you can choose between bowls and wraps. Where things began to fall apart for me was having to basically put my meal together. At first I thought it would be nice to choose what I wanted from the salad bar set up but it prooved to be harder than I expected to get everything I wanted into the pita and not cause a mess. Also I got some avacado and would have liked for it to be sliced. Having a whole half of an avacado also took up a lot of space in the pita. That may sound winey but it's the little things that added up for me here. I also felt that the quality was a little lacking although it did match the price.\n\nThis city isn't exactly hurting in terms of mediterranean places to choose from. Maybe I just had a bad experience or didn't know what to expect but I feel I could have gotten much better food and had better service. Maybe try it out and see how you like it but for my time there are better places to go to in the city." u'Great falafels on the go and love the salad bar options that come with it! Will definitely return!' u"Food was good but the service was absolutely abhorrent at this location. We were also approached by a person who came in from outside to try and sell deodorant to everyone eating. Maybe it's just the area but PASS." u"So we had just left the Majestic Theatre near Times Square and were starving. Of course we wanted Shake Shack but the line was ridiculously long. So we figured we'd keep walking 'till we found something. I'm so happy we decided to try Maoz. \n\nI got the chicken shawarma bowl and I also got to try the falafel and hummus bowl. With bottles of water everything came up to around 23USD. We went all out on that salad bar. I pretty much heaped my bowl with most salads and sauces resulting in a flavour bomb. \n\nSeating is very limited and it's a very small restaurant that gets hot. I would go back though all of the vegetables salads chick peas etc. definitely had me bloated for a while! Very filling. Remember to bring the Beano or GasX with you lol" u"When my co-worker and I came for lunch I was a bit hesitant since the place is situated on 8th avenue and is still a tourist trap as it's near 42nd street. The outside leaves little to be desired in terms of decor but when inside it was somewhat nicer.\n\nOrdering food was okay but I felt rushed by the manager as if he didn't want to be there. No greeting or a smile either not that I was expecting any.\n\nThe food is excellent though. Hummus falafel and all the sides were fresh. The only exception was the chicken filet as it seemed to be re-heated (and on the oily side) but what place doesn't re-heat food?\n\nHowever I'm taking 1 star away from the review due to the place being neglected. Food scraps here and there suspect looking tables and the occasional homeless person coming in and making his rounds. Another 1/2 star for having no bread included (it's extra) attitude from manager and forgetting my side falafels.\n\nThis place could have been so much better and I attribute it to the location not the food.\n\n3.5 stars." u"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! Best bang for your buck near times square in my opinion. How it works is you pick one base (pita hummus bowl salad rice) and then a protein. The rest is an unlimited one-time toppings bar. Sort of like a chipotle for mediterranean food but you put the toppings on yourself!\n\nFood: yummy and fresh! I loved that they had sooooo many options and all vegetarian. They have beets chickpeas radish cabbage and plenty of sauces to choose from. This place a veggie haven! Also serving size is big enough to eat for two meals. \n\nCost: Decent. There are a few toppings that you can choose to add on to your base that are extra but I'd say skip that and just bulk up on the free toppings ;D It costs about $8-12 depending on what base and protein you decide to get. \n\nService: Very friendly staff! It was my first time trying it and I was confused as to how things work and the staff was very accommodating and friendly to explain. They also made me fresh chicken shawarma since the other was sitting out for a while. \n\nWill be back? It's in a prime location (although that can cause a bit of a hold up during busy lunch hours) prices are decent staff is friendly....I'll definitely be back." u"Stopped by after a Bikram yoga class.  I was in the mood for a clean healthy dish.  \nI had the salad bowl with chicken fillet (that's how they spell it).  It was $11.75 not bad for a great dish that was tasty and filling.\nI would probably just get the grill chicken and head to the wonderful do-it-yourself salad bar which features beer salad quinoa with pesto carrot salad broccoli and cauliflower and topped it off with cilantro sauce.  \nDeeellllisshhh!!!" u"More like 3.5*. I really like the food here. I usually just get the rice plate no protein and load up on the salad bar options. I was trying to eat healthier before vacation. Unfortunately I ate too much cauliflower and that resulted in bad tummy aches for a week. It wasn't really the restaurant's fault...just that now I know I can't eat too much cauliflower. Unfortunately for me I probably will not return any time soon." u"A little overwhelming when you're at the counter and don't know what you want and how to order. The staff seem friendly but not very helpful. It's basically Chipotle-style you choose pita rice bowl hummus bowl or salad. You add a protein like shawarma or falafel and then pay and wait for your order. When you get your food you can go down to the Maoz bar add any of the variety of salads and sauces free of charge. The food is pretty tasty and the salad bar was clean and regularly restocked when I visited. There's only one large communal table and a few bar seats. They take LevelUp as payment and for loyalty rewards. The one huge downside of this location is that frequent panhandlers come in and make the rounds." u"Let me start by saying that the signage outside of the store is very deceiving. I get that it's a gimmicks to get you in the door but for some customers it may be more of a turn off. Pita sandwhich starting at $3.90 or something like that. People that is just for the Pita bread;nothing else. \n\nBesides that I must say that the food I got was very good. In total my drink and my sandwich came up to about $10.90.  What was a great bounce was that toy could add as much or as little as you wanted from the salad bar. The cabbage and chickpeas were a great addition to my sandwhich. I also liked the sauces that they had available. The cilantro garlic and the hotsauce were to die for." u"This is my favorite place for lunch before a show. They start you off with a pita or salad bowl. They add the lettuce spinach and/or kale and 5 large falafel balls. Extras are hummus eggplant slices and more. Then you head for the salad bar to load up on whatever you want. I top it off with tahini and hot sauce.  After I eat this I'm good till my midnight snack. I definitely recommend this place." u'Good falafel and love the help yourself add ons bar. The bread is supposedly baked on-site but it was cold and a bit hard and not tasty. The rest was yummy. The sweet potato fries were warm and tasty as well. \nOverall yum!' u"Though it sports multiple locations Maoz is a falafel joint that cannot be beat. Pick your base (go for the hummus) grab your protein of choice and then go WILD with the toppings. Great value and don't be afraid to get in on the babaganoush!" u"This place was pretty good as far as fast food falafel goes. I've definitely had worse *cough* Mamoun's *cough*\nI might compare it to Verts in style and quality.\n\nI got the falafel pita pocket which was much larger than I expected. They do a thick pillowy pita pocket with a TON of falafel stuffed in. Then the DIY salad bar lets you stuff even more random veggies to your heart's content. It's super cheap and filling.\n \nEach falafel ball had a light thin exterior that was a little crunchy from pine nuts. Of course falafel loses crisp buried in a sandwich but I could tell the falafel was fried just right and crispy from sneaking some in from the sample giver outside.\n\nThe inside was lightly herby and slightly bitter with decent chickpea flavor. Some were fluffy while others were a bit mushy (like in my pic). It's solid above-average falafel if a bit inconsistent.\n\nThe sauces kind of sucked. I tried the tahini and garlic sauce and both were way too thin and watery. The tahini didn't taste bad but the garlic sauce was truly abysmal. Oddly sweet without much garlic flavor.\n\nI might come here again if I lived nearby. But as a tourist I'll be sticking with the slightly pricier Taim for falafel made by angels." u"Great falafels!  Reminds me of being back home in Israel.  Filling satisfying tasty !!!  Great value full sandwich w all the fixings less than $7 ! Anywhere that's a good deal in Manhattan it's a superb deal !!" u'Any other falafel/swharma place in NYC - Small and Cozy !!\n\nThe swharma pita was good. They have huge bar for add ons and you can add it yourself. The sauces are also good.\n\nThe prices are also fine .' u"Great concept! You order the base and add the veggies yourself. Not the very best falafels I've had but they were beyond decent. \n\nA bit hard to eat after stuffing the pita and it's bound to get messy. \n\nI have to say one thing about this place: GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES ($3.95)! Oh.my! The best fries I've had in a long time. Super fresh and crispy. The garlic sauce was also bomb. \n\nThe place is good for a quick and low key lunch." u"I can't even remember the last time I was so disappointed with a restaurant in NYC. Came here because they are LevelUp and they didn't take LevelUp. Offer healthy options which is good but shockingly pricey ($15 for a hummus platter?!) \n\nAll of the toppings and sides are serve yourself only and utensils are small and clearly people's hands get right into the food. Really gross considering how many people come in and how busy the location is.\n\nI appreciate the healthy options but the baba ghanoush was pretty bad- very little flavor. The salmon was well cooked. I really regret the purchase because of how expensive it all came out to be and won't be back. Left hungry and out $20"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
83.Trademark Taste & Grind,[u"Keep your eyes peeled for this place -- we missed it on our first pass down the street (but that may have been the fault of good conversation).  \n\nCan't say enough about the tasty delites at Trademark.  The Garlic Knots & Burrata Crispy Gnocchi and Flatbread leave you savoring every bite.  Both the Chopped and Mixed Greens Salads were satiating in portion and flavor; every bite was purely delicious.  Due to the volume of the atmosphere I wouldn't suggest it for an intimate first date locale but it's a fun spot to meet with friends for inventive drinks and exceptional food decor and ambiance.  Chris was thoughtful in his stops by our table to check in and ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Definitely worth an extra commute even if you're not in the neighborhood." u"Avoid Avoid Avoid. This place is trying so hard to be The Smith it's embarrassing. \n\nThe service was awful it took forever to get our food order dessert and check. The server (or food runner) that brought us our churros spilled them all over the table and picked them up and put them back in the basket and acted like nothing happened. We were stunned. Our whole table was covered in sugar. At the very least they should have brought out a fresh batch (they weren't very good so we didn't finish them anyway but still). \n\nFood was not worth the price with small portions. Everything tasted a bit too acidic like they had just put balsamic vinegar on everything. \n\nI ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was surprisingly small and even worse freezing cold. At the very least my food should be warm when it arrives. The side salad was way overdressed. None of my friends were impressed with their meal. \n\nThe desserts were perhaps the only saving grace and they weren't even that good also very expensive for what was basically a melted cookie with a half scoop of ice cream." u"Decent food but watery drinks and mediocre service\n\nWe came as a party of 6 and sat at a small ish table about enough for one plate per person but difficult to share several plates. We ordered the garlic knots and the gnocchi as starters the former of which had somewhat dry bread but decent burrata while the gnocchi was crispy and somewhat interesting. For entrees I had the spaghetti which was a decent dish (although a bit pricey for what it was) while my friend's osso buco was quite good and a hearty portion. However the drinks were fairly watery and not that tasty while the service was fairly slow despite the place not being all that busy; our server was visibly not particularly occupied at times so perhaps it was more a question of pacing that was off. It's an okay place to drop by for small bites if you're in the area." u'Oh hell yes this eatery was all sorts of amazing. The food the staff the decor everything! I cannot compliment the kitchen for their hard work and creative juices. He had the Brunch Burger with a side of fries. It was a good choice slightly gamey but a good choice nonetheless. Loved the fries though! I had the Hangover Hash and there\'s nothing short of amaze-balls in a pan to describe this dish! The sausage the onions the potatoes the eggs wow-wee!! It was rich it was decadent it was the perfect meal for a rainy Sunday. \n\nThe coffee was brilliantly served in a large mug not some tiny cup most Manhattan places serve but in a big ole mug that\'s bang for your buck. And guess what it was a damn fine cup of coffee too! To finish this great brunch we ordered the churros partially because I love churros and partially because I saw the words "key lime" and I didn\'t have to look down the menu any further. We gobbled them churros up like two starving chubby kids that escaped outta fat camp with terrific tasteful palates of course. We will return. We swear by it. WE WILL RETURN!' u'This little gem is tucked away on 36th street in the heart of midtown on a road I would normally walk right down and not give a second glance to anything on it because it all looks terrible. \n\nWe came here one day for brunch.  We were kind of worried when it seemed very quiet inside and not very crowded however once we got our food we were pleasantly surprised. I think some of stuff on the menu is very overpriced but other items are worth the amount paid. \n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the seasonal donuts.  They are an appetizer and $10.00.  For $10.00 I assumed you got a decent amount of donuts and they would be good.  The flavor was Apple Cinnamon. Well I got the Apple Cinnamon Donuts and 1. they were hard and had zero flavor to them whatsoever and 2. They were about as small (if not smaller) than a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin and you only got FOUR. \n\nAnother problem we ended up having was with the Avocado Toast we had asked the waiter if it was big enough for a meal and how much shrimp came on it.  He said yes and gave a number of shrimp.  When it arrived it was way smaller than described and barely had any shrimp on it  We had to add an Avocado Baked Egg onto it and it took at least 20 minutes (they said it would take 8).\n\nMy favorite thing on their menu has to be the classic breakfast.  For 16.00 you get 2 eggs any style bacon rosemary fried potatoes and toast.  They also had sourdough bread for the toast which I am a huge fan of and the potatoes were huge and delicious.  This meal was fulfilling and fantastic. \n\nThe TM Burger was also tried by our table and had many postive reviews all around for it. \n\nOverall I would recommend this place and I would come back for the Classic Breakfast but I highly recommend skippy the overpriced stale donuts and the overpriced and small Avocado toast.' u"For lunch I wanted to try a new place with my assistant.  My search led us to Trademark and what a winner..  \n\nWe ordered the Business Lunch which was a two course meal for $21 per person.  \n\nI chose the Caesar salad as my starter and Fried Chicken sandwich for my entree.  My assistant went with the Beet Hummus and the Chicken Sandwich.  We also ordered Tuna Poke as an appetizer and that was the BEST item we ordered.  The flavor of the Poke was spectacular with just the right balance of flavors and macadamia nuts tossed in for crunch.   \n\nI LOVED the Caesar salad with the cured egg.  The dressing was phenomenal.  The Fried Chicken sandwich was good but not as amazing as I thought it would be given the strong starters but I may have still been whirling from the AMAZINGNESS of the appetizers.  \n\nI wish we also added the 3 Cookies Togo for $10 which you would need to order when they take your order.  We ended up picking up cookies at the front of the restaurant and I have to say the Vegan Chocolate Walnut Cookie was out of this world.   \n\nMy next visit may just the the Tuna Poke Caesar Salad and about a dozen Vegan Chocolate Walnut cookies.  I can't wait!!! If you haven't gone go soon!!" u"Went for lunch yesterday and first had a drink at the bar before hand. I found the service to be solid and the decor and ambiance to be classy and upscale. I ordered a beet and potato soup special. It was ok but way too much soup in the bowl and I wish they'd have added more interesting texture. Sort of felt like eating baby food. For lunch I had their fish of the day. It was well prepared and tasty as well but nothing amazing. I might go back if I need a good lunch spot in midtown and try more things on the menu." u"My girlfriend and I came here to catch up on a rainy Sunday late morning and I absolutely concur with yelp's average rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nThe food was phenomenal from flavor to texture to presentation:\n\n- Garlic Bread: My friend and I chuckled when we saw actual garlic on top of the garlic bread and it did taste very good - and I'm usually not into garlic bread.\n- Tuna Poke: The presentation and the taste was great! I began to have cravings for this dish ever since I had it here.\n\nAs for the space it wasn't packed and had a laid back environment.\n\nThey didn't have unlimited mimosas but the food and the ambiance more than made up for that and made this a great place to catch up.l" u"This is a pretty good place for breakfast. We came here on a Sunday morning for a late breakfast and were seated right away in a nice booth. Service throughout the meal was very good and for the most part we enjoyed our food. My only complaint is that it seemed very expensive for what you get. \n\nI ordered the Whole Wheat Waffle which was listed on the menu for $16. For an additional $3 you can add berries and nuts but I wasn't going to get a $19 waffle so I declined. I assumed that it would be substantial since it was so expensive but no it was just your standard waffle made in a regular waffle iron nothing special about it. Served completely dry with a little pitcher of syrup. \n\nSimilarly my mom ordered the granola which ended up being $15 because she added yogurt and thank goodness she did because the dish was mostly yogurt. \n\nAgain we all enjoyed our food it was well made. My sister especially enjoyed her Acai bowl and my dad liked his omelette. I'm a fan just not a fan of $16 for a plain waffle." u'Perfect spot for a midtown business lunch or dinner. Cool concept you walk through a fully operating coffee spot to get to the main dining room. \n\nMy coworkers and I came for lunch and all participated in the business lunch menu ($21). You get a starter and entree with the option to add 3 cookies of the day for $10. Definitely make sure you get these cookies! There are 4-5 options to choose from for each course for the business lunch. \n\nI started with the beet and goat cheese app and had the fried chicken sandwich and fries. The portions are generous and the sandwiches come with a ton of fries! Really enjoyed the beet and goat cheese. The fried chicken sandwich was juicy and had a unique flavor profile with the addition of honey and a slice of salami. \n\nThe burgers also looked super tempting. I had a hard time deciding. The cookies come out piping hot and gooey at the end of the meal. The flavor was salted carmel with milk and white chocolate. Amazing!! Service was attentive and friendly.' u"I got a kale salad through mealpal. I think this meal worth less than $1. It is just chopped kale.... disgusting..\n\n--- \nStephen\n\nYour information for this kale salad is incorrect. I got an extremely tiny portion of undercooked mixed vegetables -- seemed less than three tablespoons. It was 5% veggies and 95% raw kale. I threw it away after one bite and got another lunch. I don't care if the ingredients are from a local farm because it was the worst food I've ever eaten in my life. I will never return to this restaurant as a regular customer and will make sure to tell all my friends and family." u"The food here is so so delicious. I had the kale and quinoa salad and because I'm moving to a more plant-based diet I didn't have protein with it. I was worried the salad wouldn't fill me up but it was really large and filled me up! I even took some home. My friend and I also shared the cookie skillet and that was AMAZING. Highly highly recommend it. Warm cookie with ice cream... can't be beat!\n\nThe waitress was very kind as well. We didn't get any drinks but I'm sure they wouldn't disappoint. Lastly great ambiance felt a little badass to walk behind the coffee shop like we were being let into a secret." u'Very eclectic food combinations that spin tradition with a new twist.  Menu is different enough to throw a curveball at any craving.  Try the Scottish olives.  They were really interesting.  The smashed beats had a very fresh and mouthfeel taste.  All and all it was a very relaxing and enjoyable lunch with different tastes and different experiences. Staff was present and professional' u"What an awesome little place in Midtown. We had the tuna pok\xe9 and garlic bites for apps and the salmon and hangar steak for entre\xe9s!  The food was awesome and the cocktails- holy smokes. My rye Manhattan was smooth as silk and so was the burp on and cider cocktail. Warning- you may drink more than you planned!  Waitstaff management and everyone else was accommodating helpful and awesome!  Must go! Didn't try the coffee shop up front but the smell was ridiculous!" u"Coolest craft coffee shop by day incredible hidden restaurant by night. You walk in through the coffee shop and enter a dimply lit beauty of a restaurant in back. There is a happening bar and a combination of high tops tables and booths. The food is ultra comfort food. Brick chicken fried chicken sandwiches salads elevated burgers etc. Everything we had was incredible. Service could not have been better. Our waitress was a real sweetheart. I can't wait to try the coffee up front. It will have to wait until next time I come back to New York. I'll dream about this place till then." u'I\'ve had really great food at everyone of the restaurants under the In Good Company group. Trademark def being one of them!!\n\n$14 cocktails. I got the uncle PAT which is grapefruit based with tequila. My friend had an old fashion. \n\nAs a table of 4 we shared the Tuna poke and burrata & knots appetizers. Tuna poke was really yummy and marinated well. The small size is $16 for a small bowl. Pretty good size if you just though want to try a bite or too with 3 other friends. The entree size of the poke is $32. The burrata & knots was rly flavorful. Wow the knots. I don\'t know how they made the bread so soft yet crunchy. And the burrata was a great pairing with it!! I usually don\'t like eating big globs of cheese but thought it paired very well with the knots! Def think the appetizers were be star of the night. \n\nI ordered the scallops which come in 4 with fingerling potatoes. It\'s a little on the saltier side but  the dish sauce and potatoes balanced it out. The dish was $34. \n\nMy friends also ordered the spaghetti & clams around TM burger and fried chicken sandwich. From what I heard from them: burger was a little dry spaghetti was "not bad" and fried chicken sandwich was great !!\n\nOverall ambience is cute and hip. A smaller spot so I\'d make a reservation just in case! Service was great!! Our waitress was really nice and sweet.' u'Everything that we had was delicious. I ordered the salmon with the side of carrots. The salmon was perfectly cooked and paired\nNicely with the parsnips. The carrots were charred to perfection.' u'Brought 20 customers/co-workers for a dinner. Price fix. Setting the reservation was easy and Christine of In Good Company was very helpful. Service was fantastic. On duty manager came over and introduced herself to make sure everything would be ok. The food was delicious too! Would definitely come back here again.' u'Great food. Their lamb rack was phenomenal and their chicken sandwich tastes as good as all the pics look. Also try their burata with knots and their meatballs. Burger was juicy yet you can skip this and we also enjoyed their pea ravioli. \n\nOnly downside desserts were underwhelming and you cant order the donuts etc that are served at the coffee shop. \n\nWorth a visit and dont forget the lamb rack!' u"Grabbed a drink and some bites here with fellow coworkers the night before a meeting the next morning in NYC. This location was close to our hotels so it was convenient to have a nice option around! It's hard not to have good food choices around here though. The atmosphere had a nice vibe good music friendly people. Service was nice. Food was great though portions on the smaller side for the prices.\n\nMeatballs: simply tasty comes with 6 pieces. \n\nPretzel steak tartar: first time I had steak tartar was a while back when I was a teen it was a good experience this was at another restaurant. I don't think my food palette was ready for raw beef at the time. But this time around it was delicious! Could have come with more crackers.\n\nFlat bread: this was my favorite dish! Crunchy crust with creamy sauce and had a nice tartness to counter the sweet squash.\n\nTuna Poke: ordered a large bowl to share between three of us. The tuna was nicely flavored and fresh. Yum!"],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
159.Uptown Swirl,[u"Been to this place twice and both times I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know what it is but when I thing crepe I think not worth it but I am wrong every time.\n\nThe combo of crepe Nutella and strawberry is delicious let alone this place adds tiramisu to the mix. This crepe was beyond good I swear I ate it in less than 2 minutes. The flavors mixed so well and the tiramisu melted and was able to meld with the Nutella. The strawberries give the crepe a nice freshness and the whipped cream tops it all off!\n\nThey also serve smoothies frozen yogurt (make your own) and savory crepes. \n\nYou can even build your own crepe out of the toppings they have. \n\nThis place is a little pricey as it's 13 dollars for some flour and chocolate. Other than the price this place is great!" u'We stopped here because it reminded us of Sweet Frog in VA. Their frozen yogurt was awesome better than Sweet Frog (if you know about Sweet Frog). The also sell crepes and waffles here which is a good combination for frozen yogurt. \nTheir customer service was excellent.  I couldn\'t have asked for better. Hubby ordered the crepe. The only complaint was that he felt it should have been cooked just a little longer because it was a little "doughy." \nThey have a pretty extensive menu to be a frozen yogurt place. \nOverall I would visit again.' u"59cents an oz for ice cream and toppings. Samples are allowed. I tried the pomegranate raspberry sorbet. It wasn't too sweet and very refreshing. In my opinion I would've had it without toppings but I settled for vanilla with toppings. They also make crepes. Although I didn't get one  two of my coworkers did and they mentioned the crepe itself was too thick. There's a small sitting area on the second floor. Downfall was upon entering there was a strange odor through out the store. It was very strong and mixture of paint/cleaner and something else. Can't put my finger on it. The area where the ice cream machines are is a tight squeeze and only two ppl max three can fit comfortably. It was an okay frozen yogurt place overall." u"Another self serve yogurt shop(why do I keep ending up in these places at weird hours) with late hours and located by Times Square. After eating at various spots in the city for pizza and other things I had a sweet tooth and figured I would try a local spot. Wide selection of unique one of kind flavors. They also apparently have crepes here which I didn't try but looked amazing from the picture. Good spot to check out and not over priced like other spots in the city to have a treat." u'Since a trip to Paris last year I\'ve been searching for an authentic crepe with the perfect moistness and perfect amount of Nutella.  I finally found it here at Uptown Swirl!  \nOther official "creperies" have produced dry crepes crepes overflowing with Nutella or crepes without enough Nutella.  You WILL NOT be disappointed in the crepes here.  Thank you Uptown Swirl!' u'Great crepe! We were greeted by Peter who was extremely friendly gave us awesome suggestions and made us a delicious crepe. It hit the spot right after our dinner in Manhattan. Reasonably priced too! Well worth the stop!' u'All the fro-yo here is either nonfat or low-fat and speaks to me. Great flavors that are very satisfying. Topping selection is as expected with nice variety and syrups to add on the fat you may have missed from the fro-yo. Middle of times square with tons of foot traffic but service (cashiers) were very nice. I think seating is available upstairs...saw customers walking down the steps before leaving store' u'Came here Sunday night and ended up staying for four hours watching the world series. The staff was so nice and helpful. The food was great. Will definitely come back.' u"Contrary to its name the shop is located in midtown. Came here for crepes on a weekend. The shop is conveniently located towards the north side of Times Square. There's a pretty good amount of seating and if you dine in the staff brings your order to you. They were also very friendly when I walked in.\n\n\nI opted for the S'mores Crepe with milk chocolate marshmallows and crushed graham crackers. They also give you the option of topping your crepes off with powdered sugar. You can also watch them make the crepe in front of you. I was quite impressed by the quick service considering it was really crowded. The crepe was also really large and filling! The batter was light and fluffy and there was a generous amount of filling. It's also interesting that their crepes are rectangular shaped instead of the usual triangle/cone shape. \n\n\nI would definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the Times Square area." u"Found this place looking for desert at 1am last summer.... they're open until 2am every day and have the most awesome crepes.  I like to grab one after dinner to go and sit in Times Square and eat it while people watching.  There are some tables & chairs inside but it's cramped.  My favorite is the #12 (strawberry banana nutella) but try their Cookie Butter - it tastes just like biscotti cookies!" u"This place is a bumper...came in with really high expectations with my friends however left a bit disappointed. They have many (non-fat) frozen yogurt or sorbet options with topping options on the side. After selecting the base and topping they will charge you based on the weight - very similar to other frozen yo places in the city. However I felt that the frozen yogurt had a strong sweet taste but nothing else - I could not even taste out the scent of milk very underwhelming! They should indeed improve the quality of yogurt! Doesn't have to be non-fat yet has to be tasty!\n\nYou could also opt for crepes here. Good add yet flavor-wise it was just so-so. Now I'm feeling really bad about bringing my friends to this place..." u"I'm so glad to have stumbled on this place!  I've had a craving for waffles for awhile and was looking for a place exactly like this.  They had many options for a ice cream shop -- even crepes and of course waffles!  The waffle was delicious -- fresh savory and soft.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I will definitely go back!" u'Great experience! Peter and Berry were great. Fast service plenty of flavors and toppings and the price is right.' u"Amazing dulce de leche crepes WOW. I absolutely loved this place even if it's in a tourist trap area. If I ever find myself in this area again I 100% won't hesitate to come get another dulce de leche crepe. My friend had the waffle and even that she said was good." u"Super reasonable pricing for the frozen yogurt. They don't have a large variety to choose from but they do have the quintessential flavors which is all that matters. I will continue to come back for the cookies and creme just wished it was a little more frozen and not as watery (but it is still good). They do however have a good selection of toppings." u"Ingredients were good. Crepe was cooked tough and burned. Couldn't even cut with the fork and knife they gave us. Staff is inattentive and slow. We stood around by the crepe iron for 5 mins or so without anyone directing us how to order (at the register). There were only 2 couples ahead of us and yet it took us 20/25 mins total inside before we got our crepe." u'Had a great late night cr\xeape here with my mom. We split a strawberry chocolate& whipped cream cr\xeape. It was delicious! This place was super busy expect a bit of a wait' u"I had the berry gelato and thoroughly enjoyed it. It had real fruit in it. I also bought a blueberry scone. I'm a big scone fan and I was impressed with the consistency of the scone. I would be wiling to try anything from Uptown Swirl." u"Atmosphere: loooots of seating for a place in the heart of Times Square. I was very impressed. And comfortable couches upstairs if you come with a large party head upstairs! Cute decor and nice lighting too. \n\nPrices: eh a little pricey for froyo but I think they're just hiked because of the stores location. My froyo I would've typically paid no more than $6 anywhere else but here it was $7 even with the 10% off. \n\nFroyo: loooots of flavors. I got the marshmallow and birthday cake- both delicious. The toppings could use some work. The fruits looked a little old but everything else was plentiful. \n\nWill I be back? It's cute and all but only if I can't find another place closer. I wouldn't be opposed to it because of the 10% off and they also give you this awesome option of blending your toppings and froyo into a smoothie.\n\nI'd say go but only if you're in the area. Don't make a special trip. :)" u"Mmmmmm we got crepe #21 (can't remember the name). It was so delicious and sweet! \nIt has bananas strawberries whipped cream a cookie butter (also can't remember the name of this either sorry guys haha) and Nutella. \nHooooolllyyyy balls! I've been doing crepes wrong! \nIf I knew adding a little heated cookie butter would make such a difference.......\nI wish I had been born into melted cookie butter. \nThe texture of the crepe was okay- a little soggy it could have/should have been a little crispier for my personal tastes. \nThe workers were really nice and helped us choose what we wanted since there were so many options. \n\nThe four stars is because they had two guys (possible friends???) hanging around our front and inside the shop and they REEKED of weed. I don't mind that they can do what they want but I don't think it's much of a family friendly dessert place right by Times Square with people smoking blunts right outside."],0.6652,0.168,0.832,0.0
64.McDonalds,[u'The choices of places to eat in New York are endless. Last time I visited the city I avoided national chains because I wanted to try as much of the local food as possible. My only regret was not eating at the McDonalds in Times Square. A shot of Time Square is mandatory in any movie about New York or even with a scene from New York. The billboards are always changing and many of the storefronts come and go. However this McDonalds is always ALWAYS there. It has to be the single most famous and likely most valuable McDonalds on the planet.\n \nOrdering at this McDonalds is a little different than what you are used to. The lines are closer to a mob but and when you get to the front you\'ll probably find that the cash register is missing an employees. That\'s because after the previous customer placed an order the cashier walked back to pick it up. You can check the marqee on the front of the register to make sure it is opened. Placing your order is business as usual but you better know what you want. The manager is pacing around behind the counter telling everybody and nobody to "hurry it up!" Either way don\'t go too far after you place your order. Your cashier will be back with your food in less than a minute and you are free to find a table. I recommend sitting upstairs near the window because you get a great view of Times Square and can do some serious people watching.' u"So the bathroom is just icky. I understand it's a heavy traffic spot. I get that. But it looks ten times worse than a port-a-potty. Main reason for the star deduction. \n\nFood is delicious as always. Fast. Management in a little bit of a bad day. Israel said he wasn't having a bad day so maybe he naturally has a more aggressive personality that you learn to love over time and friendship. I asked for extra caramel on the bottom and the top of my sundae and this request was gladly fulfilled. Thanks McDonalds!" u"Some of the worst customer service I have ever come across!! Speak to you like you're an ignorant child and yet THEY'RE the ones who mess up your order. Four times!! I repeated my order FOUR time while you stood there with your screwed up face. Instead of standing there regretting your life choices to get you where you are right now. Maybe you should start typing the order into the POS!! It wasn't just me she treated like crap. The person behind us got the same kind of treatment. \n\nAll the staff there need some more training. All staff I've come across are the same. Only one person has managed to crack a smile." u"I bet one of busiest Mcdonalds around I bet one of poorest run Mcdonalds around. Horrible in every way food is disgusting at this one just trying to get it out not taking time to make sure it's right. Only thing saving this place from one star is the fact that they had any size drink for $1 no Times Square surcharge.....good move!" u"I went in to get only one item it took me so long  the manager was very rude he was trying to get some stuff into the restaurant and threatened everyone that he would hit them if they don't move out of his way\n\nThe cashier was really slow she disappeared for long time without any reason.\n\nI spent 20 mins while I was the fourth one in my line that's totally disappointing experience." u"Has to be the most famous McDonald's right? Always packed but the line moves pretty fast. Not as expensive as I thought it would be." u'TERRIBLE SERVICE. Completely messed up on my order!! My bf had a separate order and they messed up on his as well. Staff is terrible incredibly rude.' u'People come to McDonalds for speed and convenience. This location offers neither. The lines are horribly long the service is disorganized and slow. Do yourself a favor and walk 6 blocks north to the nicer McDonalds. #AVOIF' u'The cashier that I had was very rude. We just asked a simple question and we got an eye roll and attitude instead. The food is the same as any other McDonalds.' u'Long line always! Cashier was very slow! Wait more than 20mins for my burger. Before that wait about 5mins to order.' u"Firstly: it's McDonalds so you know what to expect for food. No difference here. We came here because my daughter woke up so early and was so hungry we had no other choice. This review is less about the food and more about the location. Times Square made the experience excellent. The restaurant had people from all over the world; so many languages being spoken it was cool. And the hot cakes did save the day!" u"Avoid if you can. All the Broadway theatres are around here so it gets seriously crowded. Hard to find a seat and there are lines everywhere. They do have pretty artwork of the city on the walls so there's that." u"Stressed the importance of making my order correct the guy who gave me my order was high I asked if it was right he said yea and they forgot the sausage on my sandwich so I call ask to speak to the manager I don't know her name but I placed my order at 5:22 am (Thursday morning) 5/4/17 and after she heard my problem she rudely replied well you gotta come in the store what you want me to do about it over the phone I said hold on that's not how your supposed to talk to somebody as a manager and she hung up in my face I called again and they hung up again I don't know who you guys hire up there but I've never been treated like this ever! The only person who had any sense was the guy who took my order not the one who gave me my food" u"Lets be real It's McDonalds.. One of the most busiest locations in the world!!! I don't understand why people complain about this iconic store. It is in the middle of time square which is one of the most crowded places in the world. It's not going to have the most perfect service or food quality but they try..so you might as well have an open mind when you eat at this location. At least it is Functional and AFFORDABLE.." u"This store is often ranked as one of  the top 100 McDonalds in the USA and that has more to do with its location (Times Square Theater District) than anything else. Keeping with the theater theme the whole place feels like you're backstage at Broadway show and like a backstage Broadway production it can get hectic here.\n\nAs far as the food goes come on Hamburgler you've had it all before. Same menu that you might find in say West Virginia or Kentucky but like those McDonalds this is as good a place as any to keep your eye out for McDs' most elusive food creation...that's right burger guys and dolls I'm talking the McRib. Yes as tasty and rare as a unicorn with barbeque sauce the McRib might well make an appearance any day now. However for now you're the star of the show at this McDonalds which sports more lights than a Broadway Theater. One of the better McDonalds in NYC this spot is the perfect place to take a break from hectic roll of Time's Square. \n\nSo pull up a seat and keep your eye out for someone famous or the McRib." u"One of the less shitty Mickey D's in town.  \n\nAnd yes this is the one right smack in the middle of Times Square.\n\nWhy does this place not suck?  \n\nFor starters keep in mind the review takes into account this a McDonald's.  So it's a 4 star review in relation to other Mickey D's and not outside of the fast food universe.  With that in mind - I like the fact because of the huge amount of foot traffic here you will tend to get your orders hot and freshly made.  The fries here are also good because there's constantly someone there churning them out to keep up with all the orders.  That's a good thing for people looking for a relatively fresh hot meal.\n\nThe lines here can get crazy but it also moves along quickly.  This is a far cry from the Burger King a few blocks away by the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  That place is literally operated by a couple of random zombies who happen to want make a few bucks.  Here they do a good job of keeping things moving and orders usually fly out quickly unless you're asking for some kind of special order or have a specific request.\n\nAnyway for a McDonald's this is not bad at all." u"Worst McDonalds in the world. The staff are not serviceminded at all. The guy at the counter felt tired and annoyed. I asked a staff member on the floor where the food would come and she barely looked at my when answering me. It's also very dirty and not so cosy. Shape up McDonals Times Square - starting with your staff" u"Quick service the cashier was good- asked for fresh fries for our order. The downside- little seating upstairs. We sat near the bathroom the line was long! But that's expected when bathrooms are scarce in the city." u"Worst Macdonald's in the world! Staff are very rude no customer service here. Oh well...this is New Yorker. I would recommend early time. Dinner time is worst! We waited one hour to get order plus New Yorker is very rude they cut in the line. So be aware where you waiting the line make sure nobody cut your line. Good luck." u"This is the worst McDonald's in the city. The cashier was very rude and impolite with me. I gave her the order but  she talked to me so rude and she yelled on me she said swipe your card. I told her there is a manner. You don't need to scream on me. Maybe you should say swipe ur card please is better than yell on people. She said I am an American and in America we don't say please. Maybe in Africa they say please but not here front of all the customer cashiers and manager. I asked for the manager and I told her the story but she did not react she didn't even apologize. I cancelled the order and quit the place. But honestly I didn't understand why she mentioned Africa and what she meant by saying that. I am a customer. I was waiting on line about 30min and my order will take 30sec. So she didn't need to talk to me like this. \nReally I hope if a responsable or manager will read my message and talk to the stuff there because it's hurtful to deal with customer like this."],0.25,0.175,0.714,0.11
110.Dianne & Elisabeth,[u"We made a reservation at D&E on a whim; it was close to the theatre district and their stellar Yelp review was compelling. \n\nLucky for us we arrived during happy hour and immediately ordered the specialty cocktails. They were incredible! The place is small and cozy allowing the staff to be very attentive. We engaged with the manager a bit who offered samples of wine that paired well with our food. Everything we ordered was delicious especially those croquettes. \n\nThis place is definitely on my list of go-tos for NYC; I'll most certainly be back!" u"I walked by this establishment so many times that we finally gave it a try. There is a long wine bar with stool seating and another tight squeeze room with mostly two seater tables. I wouldn't come here with a larger group of four to be comfortable.\n\nThe thing to do is to a share a lot of plates and they have small and large splits. They also have a lot of cool cocktails. And we spent around $120 for 2 (maybe we could have had one less item)\n\nPros:\n1) Beet Salad (sizable small to split)\n2) Pesto Ravioli (4 if it is a small)\n3) Sammie Dessert had a wonderful flavor profile but I wished the cookie was slightly softer.\n4) Happy Hours until 7pm\n5) Great service\n6) No need for dinner reservations on a weekday \n \n\nCons:\n1) Kale Dip awful and not creamy/over powered by the cheese. but the breadsticks that came with it was the only saving grace\n2) Quinoa and mushroom - wasn't anything I couldn't do in my own kitchen and lacked spices.\n3) Corn dogs - I was intrigued but this was just a regular corn dog with a lot of dipping sauce. I wished at least they made them mini- so you can try all the sauces.  \n\nDebatable items:\n1) Duck Confit wasn't remarkable but solid.\n\nI might have set my expectations too high here b/c the atmosphere is fantastic but only half the food was worthy of a return visit. Unfortunately I'm not in a huge rush to come back." u"Ok so I'm in New York for business didn't know where to have dinner on Sunday night and Yelp pointed me to Dianne & Elizabeth.  Thank you yelpsters for your very useful reviews.\n\nI was welcomed into the restaurant sat at the bar and bartender Nico took over.  He explained the concept of the restaurant and recommended two small plates.  \n\nI had the beet salad with fennel and apple (terrific) and the ravioli with basil (even better).  The Palmer Old Roots Chardonnay -- from Long Island -- was excellent.\n\nI plan to return next time I'm in the neighborhood." u'Walking around looking for lunch before a show. Found this amazing restaurant. Small but inviting. Fabulous food and bottomless brunch drinks for $19.95! \nBellini is the best. Food was great. Waffles to die for. Must have the fries combined with fried onions with herb aioli. Piallard chicken is a great choice as well. Make reservation.' u'The service was impeccable. \n\nI found the brunch to be just ok. I had the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly. There was  polenta under steak which was just ok it felt under seasoned. And the hash brown was like a hockey puck which happened to be seasoned well. \n\nI also had the croquettes which I added salt onto as well.' u"My friend and I visited this place for a late dinner after a broadway show. We were hoping we went far enough west to skip tourist traffic and we did. This place is great for small or large plates but has classic midtown pricing. It also seems like brunch would be fun here.\n\nI enjoyed the cocktail menu as the drinks were real and not frozen happy hours. We explored the duck shrimp and side of quinoa with mushrooms.\n\nIt's definitely a great place if are seeking quality around Times Square. I hope I get to visit for brunch sometime." u'I thought this place was so cute! Came with a couple friends late on a Saturday night and it was the perfect way to catch up over some great wine. We ordered the mid range Riesling (a little over $50 for the bottle) which was pretty delicious. We also opted for a cheese plate that included a really great soft cheese bread honeycomb and an absolutely delicious pepper jelly. \n\nThe ambiance is really great as well and I could see this being a great date spot as well. Hope to be back to try the food/tapas!' u'Had a very enjoyable experience here...  It is just a short walk from Times Square but feels like miles away.  This is a local neighborhood restaurant that is putting out great food and cocktails.  We tried several small plates and they were all wonderful.  I will definitely return.' u"Service was great but food was only ok. \n\nChicken liver crostini - the liver was cold which was disappointing. So was the bread. \n\nDuck confit - this was good! \n\nShrimp app with grits - was pretty good \n\nShort rib - dry the accompanying red cabbage didn't work well and was literally raw cabbage.\n\nAsparagus - this was literally $6 for 6 pieces of asparagus. Was very sub par.\n\nPasta - felt like I cooked leftover veggies with pasta \n\nDessert - didn't see anything that interested me" u'Tenth Avenue in Hell\'s Kitchen has long been a "no man\'s land" when it comes to the restaurant scene.  The only mainstays over the last several years have been Pio Pio 44 & X and 44 1/2. A few years ago along came farm-to-table The Marshal bringing with it a new ambiance and cuisine to the area.  It is the success of The Marshal that allowed the introduction of Dianne & Elisabeth by the same owner just down the block a quaint wine bar that also includes fresh produce and eclectic mains and various varietals of wine you can\'t get just anywhere. \n\nHaving visited Dianne & Elisabeth a few times now I can say the service the food and drink and the ambiance is consistently exceptional. My favorite wine on the menu which I recommend very highly is the Counoise a red varietal that is medium-bodied and not too sweet yet not bitter.  And it is a perfect reasonably-priced wine. In fact ...it\'s the only wine I choose to order here. \n\nOn to the menu: \nSpicy Marinated Pineapple  ($5) - Huge pieces of pineapple seasoned nicely \n\nLangostino Poppers ($12-small $18-large) - beer battered langostinos lemon garlic thyme aioli.  So far this is the best plate I\'ve tried on the menu - each "popper" is verrry meaty and only lightly battered. \n\nBeet Apple & Fennel salad ($12-small $18-large) with blue cheese caraway and a red wine honey vinaigrette.  This was the perfect balance of the sweetness of the apple with the bitterness of the beets presented beautifully. \n\nCroquettes ($12-small $18-large) - pork lardon swiss cheese smoked paprika cream.  I\'m generally not a fan of dishes on the creamier and cheesier side (only a personal preference) but these are definitely worthwhile if you are. \n\nSo far I\'ve only been for wine and apps but the rest of the menu looks awesome.  Hopefully I\'ll get the opportunity to go back again soon and try more.  \n\nWhen it comes to ambiance and service I must say George the bartender and Emilio the service have been nothing but kind and professional.  Plus sitting at the bar having a glass of wine - you never know who you\'ll meet in the neighborhood.  It\'s one of those very inviting cozy and warm atmospheres that is great addition to the neighborhood - plus it\'s a great date spot too (although for now it\'s only open for dinner) .' u"The place itself is really nice small and intimate however their menu is def priced way high. Ordered the shirt rib (very tender came with 2 fingerlings) shrimp and grits (smaller size comes with 4 larger comes with 7) burrata with red green and yellow tomatoes and the croquettes (filled with Swiss). I mean... I go out to eat a lot! And I didn't think anything I had was amazing. The plates were well constructed and pretty small in size (hence tapas) but I just can't get over the price for what I had... I felt like I should have been really wow'd. They even charged $4 for a small piece of bread to go with the cheese! And.. the sauce that the croquettes are sitting in was not good at all tasted sour even ask for it on the side! \n\nBottom line: I wouldn't come here starving I might come back with girls for drinks but even still we love to eat and the food isn't really that great for a $150 bill. We left still hungry...\n\nThe cucumber cocktail I had was really good and the staff were very nice and accommodating since we were in a rush to get to a show. ." u"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat before heading over to the movie theater. It was around 6:45pm on a Saturday so we were able to be seated right away and order a drink off the happy hour menu.\n\nFor food we decided to split a few items:\n\nBeet Apple Fennel Salad (3 stars): This was very fresh but I just felt like the flavor was very limited.\n\nRamp and basil ravioli (3 stars): This dish was also fine but just lacked any real kick of flavor.\n\nHarissa roasted cauliflower (3.5 stars): The flavor of this dish was good but the cauliflower wasn't cooked as much as I would have liked and was a bit tough to eat.\n\nThe drink I had was one of the tequila cocktails on the happy hour menu and it really lacked any excitement in flavor as well.\n\nOverall this is a small cute space that has some interesting concepts on their menu but just seems to lack flavor and inspiration in a lot of their dishes. Also I felt like the pricing on the menu was pretty high considering the portion sizes." u"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this little treasure in Hell's kitchen. We were looking for good Tapas and wine and we found it. We started with spicy pineapple and a Caesar salad and then had small plates featuring burrata  roasted shrimp quinoa & mushrooms goat cheese ravioli and finished with cranberry & rhubarb fritters.  The food and service were excellent." u'Stopped in spontaneously with a friend on an early weekend evening. The space is cozy and modern with exposed brick and lots of white in a dimly-lit bar. \n\nThey have a lot of seasonal cocktails and shoes from some of which have a very unique twist. Although the bottle selection is very small each of their featured beers were unique and above average.\n\nThis was a perfect place to catch up and lose track of time. I took a quick glance at the food menu and I look forward to coming back in trying some.' u'I came in very late at night due to travel. Service was super friendly even though the kitchen was close to closing. The house roasted mixed nuts with truffle oil were an awesome appetizer. The Hudson Valley Burrata had an exceptional variety of very fresh heirloom tomatoes with sharply distinct flavors and textures and the cheese itself was excellent. Everything else was very good but those two were amazing.' u'Like the rating says this place is as good as it gets.  \n\nThey have a couple of main course dishes but this place is known for its tapas.\n\nMy favorite items were the ravioli croquettes and the shrimp.  We also ordered the fries I would do that again.  We asked if they would take a side from one of the main dishes the polenta and serve it on its own.  They accommodated that request and I am glad they did.  It was amazing.' u"We have really enjoyed Dianne & Elisabeth as quiet place to have a drink after work. It is far enough west to be away from the madness and worth the extra block's walk. \n\nThe bar is inviting and comfortable with friendly service and a well thought out wine list. \n\nThe food is excellent the langostino poppers and shallot fried have been our favorite.\n\nA relaxing oasis." u"The facade of Dianne and Elisabeth makes the place seem half as big as it really is. Literally . When you first walk in you see the bar along the left wall and there's a wall on your right. It's a little confusing because the host doesn't have a station at the door. Having said that once we were greeted by the host we were led past the bar around the end of the wall to the other half of the restaurant where all the tables are. \n\nWe decided to forego entrees and just shared four small plates between the two of us. The shrimp and grits were delicious. My favorite of the four things we ordered. I am not a scallop fan but my husband is so we ordered the bay scallop poppers. The batter is light and then scallops were cooked well. The kale dip was a bigger serving that I anticipated. So yummy. Not as heavy as many spinach dips are. Lastly we shared the ramp ravioli. Didn't really taste the ramp but very good raviolis nonetheless. \n\nWe were a little disappointed that they were out of the duck wing confit. We definitely wanted to try that. I also wanted to try their black and white mojito but they were out of that too. I had the Duke of Earl which was supposed to be made with tea but had no tea flavor in it at all. \n\nOverall a good dinner. I would like to go back again and try some of the other dishes." u'Wonderful food and atmosphere and personable and welcoming staff. Thank you for a great meal!' u'I was super excited to try this restaurant out but it was a huge disappointment. The food was mediocre but the cocktails were amaaazinggg. My tip is to come during happy hour 5-7pm to enjoy the drinks. Food was not worth the price. Cute atmosphere though (waiter took 40 minutes to bring us the croquet because he got the order wrong. )'],-0.0258,0.13,0.736,0.134
189.Sapporo,[u"Came here for peak lunch hour on a whim one Wednesday since it's nly a few blocks from my office. I'd heard a lot about their ramen and was super eager to check it out. The hostess out front was really friendly and sat me at the bar right away. It gets very packed during the day but people come and go quickly so getting a table isn't hard. They've got a lunch special that runs from 12-3 or so for $12 + tax. I got the Wednesday pork chashu special with no corn plus a rice bowl on the side. The beef on the rice bowl was the right amount of umami the ramen's broth was delicious and piping hot despite how quickly they got it out. Good size serving.\n\nNo-frills crazy quick service a wide variety of delicious ramen - all I could've asked for." u"I went to Sapporo for an early dinner with a friend a month and a half ago.  She was craving ramen and we were passing by.  I had eaten at Sapporo a few times when I worked in the area over 10 years ago.  The ramen here is pretty standard.  No bells and whistles.  No amazing broth that's been simmering on the stove for 3 days.  I ordered the vegan miso ramen (vegan stock baby bok choy brown mushroom sweet corn scallion Nira leek & bean sprout )  I'm a mostly vegetarian so this was the only ramen option for me.  I usually don't order miso ramen because they're a little salty for my taste and I did find the vegan miso at Sapporo too salty.  I realized after I finished that I probably could have asked the waiter to skip on the miso.   \n\nOverall the ramen here is OK.  I'd visit again because it's in a convenient location and is a filling and inexpensive meal.  There are a lot of better ramen places in the city (ippudo and Totto are within walking distance to Sapporo and I would recommend going to either of those instead if you are willing to pay more and possibly wait on line." u"This was a yummy small restaurant tucked to the side of a noisy street in NYC. When you enter the host seats you rather quickly. We didn't have a reservation and arrived around lunch. We were seated in less than 3 minutes. The people are very friendly and the service is very fast. \n\nThe food is perfect for a cold day. I enjoyed the pork friend dumplings (6 of them) with miso soup as my appetizer. My sister enjoyed the Katsu-don (with pork) and I truly enjoyed the spicy miso soup with pork and a half boiled egg. Scrumptious! It also comes with a side of spicy sauce. For dessert I would recommend the Mochi specifically the mango." u"1. The SAPPORO is located by the Times Square in Manhattan New York. More specifically it is right by the corner of the 7th Avenue and 49th Street. \n\n2. This restaurant's chefs are Japanese and the wait staffs are also young Japanese. Needless to say the foods that they serve here are also very authentic and real deal in my personal opinion. Several of my Japanese friends also said the same to me. (I am originally from Osaka Japan.) \n\n3. The Sapporo opened its door in 1975. Since then this authentic yet affordable small Japanese restaurant has been serving a variety of Japanese popular dishes such as the ramen pork cutlet curry rice gyudon (beef bowl) etc. Nevertheless it is most famous for the variety of ramen dishes. Their popular ones are miso ramen shoyu ramen tan-tan men chashu ramen sio ramen etc. The delicious ramen dishes are about $10 - $13 (very reasonable) and served vary fast. These are so good so that you have to wait for over 30 minutes during the dinner hour even during the weekdays. You see a lot of Asians and businessmen dining here. This is not a restaurant for the tourists. If you want to eat like locals in the area this is it.   \n\nThere are two restaurants that I usually dine when I visit the Times Square area: one is the Chef Yu Chinese restaurant and another is the SAPPRORO Japanese restaurant. Unlike the overpriced restaurants around the area these two restaurants serves excellent authentic foods that worth every penny. (Personally I really do not like American foods. So I usually do not go American restaurants except a few diners which operates 24/7 and with very interesting interior designs for entertain my eyes.)\n\n4. The SAPPORO takes only cash. This seems has not been changed alter all these years. From these deeply discounted meals the restaurant can not really make a money so the turn around of the customers is the make or break crucial point of running this tight-budget business. This is why they decided to go cash only style payment rather than the time-consuming credit card payment here.    \n\n5. The people working at the SAPPORO (the chefs and wait staffs) seem all very happy working there even the peak busy time of the day. I like that kind of mood and vitality of the restaurant. (Compare these happy hard working people to the counterparts who often idly standing around or chatting with other wait staffs even at the busy dinner hour at some of the other restaurants in the area. They are as different as night and day.)\n\nI highly recommend the SAPPORO to my friends for enjoying the light but very authentic variety of Japanese meals in the Times Square area.  \n\nDr. Takeshi Yamada and Seara (Coney Island sea rabbit)\nReview: August 9 2017\nPhotos (2): October 13 2015 (miso ramen)" u"I came across this little gem back in 2009 and loved their ramen. The texture of the noodles was always perfectly chewy and the broth was always rich and tasty. The pricing was very reasonable compared to other ramen shops. I really liked how you could add on a small bowl of gyudon or curry rice with your ramen to try out other things without getting that full dish. This ramen shop quickly became my favorite when I used to live in the city. I recently returned to visit and wanted to see if Sapporo was still around and was delighted to find that it stayed the same- the menus the taste the atmosphere and the hostess's greeting. This is really important because a lot of restaurant start out good and the quality slowly decreases over time but even after 8 years Sapporo's quality still has not changed.\n\nI've tried many of the well known ramen shops in the city but still find myself loving Sapporo's ramen the most. I definitely look forward to coming back again when I visit the city." u"Came here in May with her and her family. We ordered three dishes to be split among four people the Sapporo Mazemen Gyu Don and the Karaage Curry rice. I had always been okay with the restaurant knowing that it is almost unreasonably cheap in ground zero of tourist hell (Times Square). But because this guy I know had a penchant for dragging us there I was going to be bored of it.\n\nCrystal's family didn't know where to go for lunch so I quickly said Sapporo. They wanted to see the museums anyway so I thought it would be a good choice. Turns out they loved it. Her parents kept commenting how good the food was during and after the meal. \n\nI was impressed with the mazemen really cool presentation. It's on the special menu item. It had a lot of veggies and there's some pork and seafood. I have a shrimp allergy but nonetheless went for it. The gyu don can get a little dry but the chicken didn't disappoint! Loved it. So we had a great time there.\n\n**\n\nReturned here about a week later with my HS buddy. We wanted to look for something cheap to eat since he's chronically broke or something (you can't spell broke without bro). We both ordered ramen but I also added a fried rice to the side. Great way to end a day. But because we were both so tired I didn't have enough energy to even remember how good the food was. We can let the pictures do the talking." u'THE SHOP\n\nSapporo was the first Japanese ramen restaurant to open in New York City. In 1975 this ramen ya opened its\' doors with the intent of sharing Japan\'s only 100% Japanese style of Ramen; Miso. Miso ramen was developed in 1960 in Hokkaido Japan\'s northernmost island making it Japan\'s youngest as well as it\'s only non-salt based style to this day. \nThe name "Sapporo" is a tribute to the Japanese city of Sapporo where miso ramen is king. This ramen ya is located on 49th street just off of the busiest section of Broadway in Times Square. \n\nTHE RAMEN\n\nSapporo offers a shio shoyu tan-tan men and Miso ramen making sure to have something for everyone. Given the shops\' clear loyalty to Sapporo as a region I thought it only right to judge this ramen ya based off of the miso ramen.\n\nMiso ramen by nature is slightly sweet nutty and of medium weight. It is known for having a myriad of ingredients including (but not limited to) chive scallion pork corn ground beef bean sprouts butter and thick curvy yellow noodles to help grip all the goodness. \n\nIn this regard Sapporo is easily a FIVE BOWL experience. The soup comes with all of the above each of which is served in generous portions. The soup is HOT and the noodles are always cooked slightly under to ensure they do not become soft and mushy. Every bite pulls up bits of ground beef chives corn and bean sprouts. \n\nTwo words come to mind when describing Sapporo ramen; rustic and satisfying. It is the overall balance of textures and flavors that takes precedence. From the chewiness of the noodles to the slight crunch of the bean sprouts to the sweetness of the corn and the umami of the broth; this ramen leaves no sense un-touched. \n\nThis ramen is perfect come November when the temperatures drop and people begin to break out their parkas. Whether you are completely unfamiliar with miso ramen are a devoted fan or are just out and about on a cold day Sapporo is the place for you. \n\nSERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE\n\nThe restaurant is small with 15 or so free standing tables a narrow stretch of bar and a small counter that faces outwards toward 49th. Service is casual but very attentive. I have been here a number of times and I have always been greeted promptly served quickly and have always had my water glass refilled multiple times throughout my dining experience. The staff manages to maintain a "get you in and get you out" pace without making you feel hurried or rushed.' u'Needing a ramen fix we grabbed some bowls. We were pleasantly surprised by good tasting broth and noodles. The pork was a little overcooked.  We got the lunch special for $12 that included some much needed small plates of vegetables. Also in the lunch special was a bowl of seasoned beef which was very good.\n\nOnly thing missing from the ramen was a soft boiled egg. My bad should have asked about it and would have paid for it if not included.\n\nThe place was packed at lunch time apparently very popular. They are fast and efficient with the service. The restaurant seemed very clean.\n\nThey definitely hit all the boxes for me and I would be back to work my way through the menu.' u"Stopped at this place for lunch with a friend and it really wasn't anything out of this world. He went with the Sapporo Miso which was good I opted for the Onioroshi Shoyu. The noodle in my ramen were slightly thicker and even felt a little slimy. I wasn't too fond of that but the broth was good. We also shared a mini pork gyoza which was the highlight of our meal. Keep in mind that this place is cash only!! I'll probably stop by again if I'm in the area and in the mood for some ramen." u"Came here on a weeknight for dinner with some ladies and this place was pretty good. For the location - price of ramen is to be expected around $13 and shared a number of appetizers and left full and happy.\n\nMixed Fry - calamaris and french fries with this orange dipping sauce - amazing!\nFried chicken meatballs - pretty good\nPotatoe salad - surprisingly good. (I know I'm just as confused) The salad was served with their house dressing - I have no idea what but it was banging!!!!! If I wasnt afraid of being glutenous and 1000lbs I would drink it.\nTan-Tan ramen - flavorful broth meats was like ground beef/pork and some chashu - pretty good. Ramen could have been more bouncier and elastic but overall still pretty good.\n\nWould recommend for the area but it does not make it to my top favorite ramen places." u"I didn't realize one could get good inexpensive food in Times Square let alone tasty ramen from an authentic Japanese spot that's been operating for decades. I went to Sapporo for a late weekday lunch with my friend Ed L. while I was visiting New York and was pretty pleased with the place.\n\nEd is always posting incredible food pictures on Facebook (paired with premium grade puns) so I was happy to eat with him at one of his regular haunts. He has a long history with Sapporo--he's been coming here since the '80s when he was a freshman in college. It was apparently the first ramen restaurant in New York opened in 1975 pre-dating the more recent ramen craze by over thirty years.\n\nThe shop was small and moderately busy even at 2:00 in the afternoon. The vibe was casual and relaxed with plain decor and fast unfussy service. Cash only which I wouldn't have been prepared for but Ed was nice enough to treat me to lunch.\n\nThe food was solid. Classic comforting Japanese fare. This was sort of my second lunch of the day (I was walking past 53rd and 6th and decided this was the day I finally tried the Halal Guys) so we ordered a moderate amount of food splitting the spicy miso ramen and the tonkatsu. Ramen appears to be Sapporo's main draw and I greatly enjoyed the spicy miso. The noodles were satisfying and I liked the rich broth which came with a side of spicy paste to crank things up even further. Plenty of toppings too--minced pork sweet corn scallion nira leek been sprout Thai chili and fatty rounds of pork chashu. We got more pork in the tonkatsu platter a substantial pork cutlet breaded and deep fried served with a bowl of rice a bit of potato salad and a heap of that shredded cabbage you always see at Japanese restaurants but that I'm not convinced isn't just a voluminous garnish. The pork was tasty especially with the tonkatsu sauce. It also came with a side of miso soup which was unusually good swimming with seaweed and curled strips of oden.\n\nI had a great time at Sapporo. The food was good and I felt like I got a neat little taste of culinary history. I'd highly recommend it if you want to try the original NYC ramen or if you just want to eat in Times Square without paying bloated prices at a chain restaurant." u"If I'm in New York I'll be eating here. Ramen is fantastic and so is the Katsu curry. Been eating here since 2007." u'The food is goos but the service is awful especially the woman at the register. Often come here since the food is pretty good but the register woman is always nasty. I did both dine-in and take out. If you are dine-in then you don\'t need to deal with this woman but if you are taking out she asks phone number and name and you have to tell phone number and name when you come to the store. The stores are noisy so she misheard the phone number  (one last digit) and she was pissed. She always is nasty and asks if I have 5cents to be exact price of the meal. (For example if the meal was $15.05 I cannot just pay $20 cash since she asks several times if I have $20.05) if I say "no" she gets pissed. Since it is cash place just take $20. Don\'t ask me many times if I have 0.5cents. Anyways the food is good but her service is always bad' u"The place is nice and the service is good. But there's nothing special for the ramen. It tastes like korean instant noodles. However I like the appetizer such as the takoyaki & gyoza" u"Food:\nTan Tan Ramen - A good tasting broth for sure.  I chose to get extra noodles and it made for a good heaty portion.  \n\nService:  Friendly and attentive staff.  \n\nAmbiance: Just your average quick bite place.  Very casual.\n\nOverall:  Despite the selection being tapered down...it's still a good place to grab a quick bite." u"I've been coming to this ramen spot since high school and have to say it's one of the top ramen spots of the city thus far. At about $12 a bowl the ramen is rich and stocky with a healthy serving of noodles and melt in your mouth pork. Service is friendly and SUPER fast. during rush times it can be very crowded and it is CASH ONLY. but if you come casually and grab a seat you won't be disappointed. \n\nI am a big fan of the takoyaki or fried octopus in doughy ball form - fresh and crackling and oh so tasty. The shoyu ramen is also fantastic. they offer plum wine and an assortment of sakes as well as ramune- a yummy japanese soda that pairs oddly well with the heavy soup. \n\nSapporo is a great place to go with friends or for a date or completely alone! The location is a bit of a pain being very close to the heart of times square but if you can fight though the tourists to grab a bite here it's worth it." u'After having gone to Sapporo for many years starting with its opening (see my earlier review) I visited today my first time in several months. \nOne star fewer than last review... "Kooch" the colorful head of the open kitchen is gone so is one of my favorite dishes yakisoba which was great. The gyoza is still outstanding and the ramen is still very good but not as good as it once was. It appears that there\'s new management too including new high-gloss slick menus. Not as crowded I noted  and there was no line waiting to get in.  So the upshot is: still worth going but simply not as "special" as in the past.' u"Came here for a quick pre-theatre dinner.  Place was packed but was seated immediately.  Ordered the NY Times recommended minced pork tan tan ramen.   Best bowl of ramen I've ever had for $13.  Service was quick and attentive.  Will definitely go back and order the appetizers when I have more time for a proper complete meal." u'Idk what all these 3 stars are about but this is surely a go to for Ramen for a good price. From the appetizers to the Ramen my family from every nation... literally... is always satisfied... \nParking doesnt exist but what would you expect in this spot at NYC? Pay the few bucks for a stress free meal which will probably want you to take a walk after.' u"3+\n\nWhat is wrong with all these reviewers? Why are you all so disappointed that a Japanese restaurant doesn't serve sushi? Japanese people eat other things besides sushi!\n\nEverything is enjoyable here - ramen noodle bowls gyoza kimchi soup. The portions are quite large the service is attentive and the prices are reasonable for midtown. The happy hour deals are also make it affordable. Definitely recommended."],0.4019,0.73,0.27,0.0
105.Cock & Bull,[u'We were in Manhattan for a trip and were meeting with a friend here at the Irish pub. It was very close to Rockefeller center and walking distance to Times Square. We went in the restaurant and were greeted immediately by the friendly waitress. She brought us to a booth so we could relax and have fun time without being interrupted by people going around us. \n\nThe restaurant has a very cool Irish vibe where you could see the Irish decorations all over the restaurant. I ordered the grilled wings and they both had yummy slider burgers with onions and mushrooms in them. The sauce they gave me went quite well with the wings and loved it. So we also ordered some drinks and had nice conversations. They waitress was very good about refilling my hot water and helped picked up the plates when we were finished. \n\nCool vibe and will come back next time visiting Manhattan.' u'Bar tender just stands behind the bar chatting and chatting never taking orders.  \n\nMediocre food at expensive prices.' u"What I drank: Young's double chocolate stout \nVisit date: October 16 2017\nFirst time? Yes.\n\nCock & Bull is a super chill hangout with plenty of seating and a great selection of beers. It was fairly quiet (I'm guessing because we went on a Monday night) which was nice because we were looking for a casual place to hang out. I had the Young's double chocolate stout which was on tap. It was really smooth and I surprisingly drank the whole thing which means it was either really good or I'm getting really good at drinking stouts." u'This place has a huge variety of drinks including cask beer and high-end scotches. I was there at 2 so after the lunch rush but there were enough people around the vibe was nice for an afternoon break. I sat at the bar and had the Cock and Bull draft which was good and a scotch egg which was tasty but not the best one I\'ve ever had - the egg was slightly over-cooked. \n\nThey also sell British food in a miniature "bodega" behind the counter.\n\nOverall a good place for a drink.' u'Was in New York City and stopped by this pub for a pint in the middle of the afternoon.    The place was practically empty waiting for the onslaught of office workers who would be getting off work in a few hours.    I had the cask conditioned ale.   It is served near room temperature this ale has very little carbonization and is quite hoppy.   I had the pale ale made by a local microbrewery.   It was excellent.   \nI did not try any food as I was going out for dinner soon.   They did have bangers and mash on the menu.   I will try those next time.' u"You had me at cask ale. Good location for post show drinks/food. The food was pretty decent. I had the hangar steak sandwich and enjoyed it.  I would give this place another go in a heartbeat - everything that passed by looked and smelled good service was on point and the beer menu is stellar. We slunk to the back because we weren't feeling social but the bar looked like a great place to hang out and b.s. with the bartender and patrons." u'We had the fish and chips and a pint of their house rye ale.  The cod tasted fresh and the beer batter had a good texture and flavor.  Fast and friendly service too.  The place has a good vibe to it as well.' u"I came here with some friends for lunch some time ago and none of us were expecting that much; we were just hungry and saw a place to eat. However all of us were completely blown away by the food. It was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted and one of my friends a Buffalo native said the Buffalo Wings were the best she ever had (and she had come in expecting to be a wing snob!). \n\nIf you're ever near Rockefeller Center it's definitely worth going to. The burgers are simply to die for." u"Cock & Bull British Pub & Eatery is nicely located in Midtown Manhattan just off Fifth Avenue. My husband & I stopped in for some early evening drinks and an appetizer. \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is warm and befitting of a British Pub. Our bar service was super friendly. The Scottish Egg was delicious. Shared one but it was so tasty that we definitely could've each enjoyed our own. \n\nI would visit again for more of the same and a meal." u"Was in the area and tried the place. It definitely has a nice and dark vibe that creates that British pub vibe. That being stated I went for dinner and tried the Crab Cake and a Burger. The crab cake definitely had a crabby taste and was solid. The burger seemed to be like any generic burger just solid also. I wouldn't say that this is a place that I would go out of my way to go to but think it's a nice place to just hang out with a friend." u"This is a fun little restaurant. It has an English theme to it. There are two floors to it. My husband and I stopped in on a Monday around 1pm. I ordered the iceburg salad with the tomato and fennel soup and my husband got the chicken wrap. My salad was decently good. A light amount of bacon and dressing. It could have used a little more blue cheese and a little less tomato to it. The tomato and fennel soup was great. Very creamy with so much flavor. My husbands chicken wrap was decent. It could have used mustard or something on it because it was a little dry. \n\nThis place looks like a great spot to watch a game. There is a giant TV that you can see from the second floor. There are also tons of Tv's by the bar area. I was suprised at how well lit the place was. From the outside it looked like it might be a bit dreary but to our surprise it wasnt!\n\nOverall prices were decent service as good and the food was good. I would definitely recommend stopping in here." u"Based on other reputable reviews I was expecting more. Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience. There was a bartender (male) who wasn't very friendly and actually quite rude. The female ones were pleasant. Their HH prices aren't really a deal.\nDid like their beer selection and really enjoyed their housemade rye beer. \nDoubtful I would return..." u"Decent but kinda pricey spot for lunch.\nEntrees hover around $20 and even sandwiches w/ fries go for around $15.\n\nThe beer selection is a bit small - and the beer flight seems like a bit of a rip off (comes out to about $4 for 6oz tasting glasses while 10oz half pints of anything are $4.50)\n\nTried their cask beer - wasn't impressed with it. As other's have said - its a little weird to be drinking room temperature/warm beer.\n\nThe famous fish and chips was pretty good but maybe not $20 good. I loved the thick cut home-made fries but they definitely needed salt. The portion of fish was pretty good though. The star of the show is their home-made tartar sauce - goes great with everything.\n\nOverall - decent spot but too pricey to keep coming back" u"Service friendly attentive and professional... a trifecta! The fish and chips perfect with the fish perfectly done. Just enough to fill and a juicy lemon quarter to add zing. Tartar sauce of course. Thick cut fries great.  Mushy peas with bacon superb.\n\nThe house CEB ... their house bitter... was one of the best I've had. Clear clean tasting refreshing with a hoppy seriousness every decent bitter requires.\n\nGreat establishment that is great at what they do." u'O. M. G. The potato leek soup!!! For the soup a 5 out of 5 for taste! Blended bacon within = amazing flavor!\nAs for the rest.. eh. Sub par? More like a 3 out of 5.  I had the British Bulldog. The pork sausage itself was tasty but the casing was very incredibly tough. The baguette was perfect. The sides were mediocre.\nWould return simply for the soup.  Realistically would give this place a 3.5 out of 5 stars because the meal itself was not impressive but since I had to round up or down I went with the Christmas spirit for the 4 out of 5 stars.' u"Cozy and authentic feel of an English pub.  The Shepherd's Pie is a favorite." u'Visiting New York and was so excited to find this place!! We loved the food in the UK and this place delivers! Fish and Chips along with Sticky Toffee Pudding were delicious and our server was perfect!! So glad we found this place!' u'GREAT place great food and good service.   All smiles and good atmosphere.  The fish and chips are worth coming for.  The steak sandwich and chicken pot pie are good to go!!!!!\n\nGlad we walked 9 blocks to get here and will definitely come back next time we are in NYC.' u"Great food! Great service! We had fish and chips steak sandwich and chicken pot pie. All were delicious. We'll definitely comeback when in NYC." u"From the outside you can't tell but it's pretty nice inside .. I gave it five stars because though the service was average the food & drink were delightful and affordable. You walk upstairs to a nice mood lit eating area with comfy seating. Don't want to leave negative comment on friendliness of our server service was fine maybe she was on autopilot ..but James (who helped our server) was so genuinely friendly. His beautiful smile reflected his personality..his service was outstanding ..but everything was delicious & you definitely won't leave hungry here."],0.9513,0.58,0.42,0.0
197.Ellen’s Stardust Diner,[u"Ellen's Stardust Diner is the ultimate restaurant for fans of musicals live entertainment and kitschy theming. I've eaten here three times and always like to show it off to visitors of the city. \n\n1950s decor + singing waitstaff = absolute fun. All the servers are aspiring Broadway performers who take turns singing show tunes Disney songs and classic hits in between serving food. It's a riot and the more you sing along the more fun you'll have. Oh and it's very very loud in here. A couple times throughout your stay the staff will pass around a bucket and collect donations to fund training/classes for the staff to grow in their careers. Bring a few dollars and help out! \n\nI come here for the entertainment and experience not the eats. The food--classic American diner stuff--is pricy and certainly nothing to rave about. If this restaurant axed the singing I wouldn't recommend it at all. A bowl of soup costs 10 bucks and a sandwich is almost 20. I suggest coming with a small appetite and splitting something. The milkshakes are good and add to the 50s diner experience. \n\nExpect to wait a while outside for a table. There's often a line wrapped outside the building meaning you could wait anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours and your whole party must be present to be seated. As fun as this place is I wouldn't wait more than 40 minutes to eat here. On my last trip to New York it took walking by on three separate nights to finally see a line short enough to wait in." u"The concept and passion to this place is pretty spectacular. Singing waiters are the best!\n\nThe food really needs some more pizzazz it really should be just as enjoyable as the singers are but it really feels half way there when it came to the food. \n\nAlthough they really have a special thing going on here their sound system NEEDS to be updated it's too loud and doesn't sound right a lot of the time through the evening. \n\nThe experience when the servers interact with the tables make women and men blush getting the audience to participate is something worth seeing and enjoying at least once in your life!" u"VERY overpriced diner with very loud music/singing. \n\nI came here during a week day lunch time and there was no queue which was a result as I've been past here before and people are lining up around the block.\n\nEllen's is exactly what I expected it to be except with a little less atmosphere. I had this vision of people singing a long and dancing in their seat to the music but it was not like that at all. Some people were just getting on with their meals like all this singing and dancing wasn't going on behind them. It was strange. \n\nFood wise... it's midtown Manhattan right but $17.50 for a grilled cheese sandwich is pretty outrageous. On the other hand the portions are huge. The calamari appetizer is enough for maybe 4 people. I feel like sharing a few plates would work well here. \n\nWouldn't go back myself but maybe it would be a fun family dinner with the kids if visiting nyc." u"All of the wait staff are singers. They take turns performing various songs. The singing is all of very high quality. 17 of the staff has graduated to be Broadway performers with the help of lessons paid for through diners' donations.  We went to eat here at about 345pm. It was not yet too busy but cramped and full. I was happy to be there at shift change. At the beginning of each shift  they have a happy birthday sing-along. The food was very good. When we were done we were not rushed out even thougb there was a line forming outside already. The food portion sizes were good not too big but enough. Prizes were NYC average. The milkshake was huge! The staff are all very friendly helpful and talented. They work very hard and still smile all the time.  If you get a chance to eat here take it and enjoy the experience!" u'When we asked our daughters the best part of the long weekend.. this was on the top!! We did wait in the freezing cold 18 degrees... about 40 min.. must say the entertainment was so worth it!! The smiles on the kids faces was not just worth but we enjoyed it to!! The burgers fries and shakes!!!  Save room or split the meal.. to get a shake!!\nWe will go back!!' u'This was one of the greatest and funnest meal experiences ever!  I had read a bit about this place so I had planned on stopping here for a bite after seeing a Broadway show.  I had thought it was going to be gimmicky singing like Johnny Rockets is.  I had no idea it was singing to this level.  These performers/wait staff are FANTSTIC!!  AMAZING!!!  The level of talent they have is off the charts and they are SOOOOOOO much fun.  They have great fun and engage all of the customers too.  It was so much fun it was really hard to leave.  \n\nThe food was ok.  Nothing terrible but nothing fantastic but lets be honest.  Nobody is there for the food anyway.  They are there for the show.  That deserves 10- stars.  I will be back!!!' u'Such a fun place!  We arrived about 5:00 and got in line. It moved fairly quick and we got a seat in a prime location. \n\nWe all ordered burgers which were huge and good. The waffle fries were cooked perfectly. \n\nBut the entertainment is the best part. We had a great time. The singers are amazing. And we loved how they interacted with the crowd.' u'The food and entertainment was amazing. Aspiring actors and singers perform while dining.....and they are also the servers. They request donations that are only used for lessons. Great experience' u"My children thought the whole experience was fantastic. The waitstaff sang Disney tracks and popular Broadway songs. \nBut that was it. That was the only good thing about this restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is dirty. The seats were filthy and had to wait for them to get clean. The food wasn't served hot and didn't have taste. Didn't receive straws and no saucers for the hot chocolate that were overflowing Good luck trying to get your server's attention because he's now singing to the restaurant. And the part that threw me over the edge was that in the middle of our meal a staff member went around the restaurant with a bucket and tambourine asking for donations for the waitstaff's Broadway career at each table. Are you kidding me?! Can we just enjoy our reheated overpriced diner food without being solicited?! I do not recommend this venue if cleanliness and good food is a priority when going out for a meal." u"I saw someone on here say you don't come to this place for the food. Well actually I did. But only because my friends dragged me to this place while in NYC. The waiters are very talented singers no doubt but honestly my ears were hurting the music was so loud and I couldn't actually watch them sing because of the lights flashing all around were hurting my eyes. One of my other friends felt the same as me while the other 2 really enjoyed it.\n\nThe food was decent and the service was nice but $25 for a friggin grilled cheese and a soda? Are you f'n kidding me?? This place is not worth it I don't understand why people go back.\n\nOh and we were halfway out the door before the staff started screaming at us to use another door. We were halfway outside at this point does it really even matter?" u'We have been passing by this restaurant many times. Always there is a super long line lining up there like in Disney.  On Labor day we walked by it and the line was not that long. So we decided to try this restaurant and see how amazing it is.  \n\nLike the name stardust implies the waitstaff are all "super stars". They performed what they good at. There are Broadway show actor pop singer and comedy actor. Our waiter looks like Nicki Minaj. The experience is sooo good and unique. We had a great time there. \n\nFor the menu the tables and the chairs we are feeling back to 1950\'s which is good. I will offer one more credit if the taste of food could be improved.' u"This was our second visit to Ellen's. We had come once before just about two years prior.  The restaurant has a cute retro feel with the old styled 50's chairs and tables.  The walls are lined with pictures of Broadway stars. Seating is snug  but comfy. Between the booths is a walk way for the performers to walk/dance as they sing. They usually interact with the patrons as well making it a blast for everyone in the family. \n\nThe food is good. It comes out quick and hot. Nothing was over or under cooked. I ordered the pride bagel sandwich a rainbow bagel with egg and cheese served with a side of tater tots.  I added bacon to my sandwich. The only down side to my sandwich was that it wasn't the rainbow bagel I had ordered and was served on a regular bagel.  It was still tasty though! My husband ordered the fruity pebbles pancakes. They were sweet but not overly so and their size was wonderful! We couldn't finish them. They were very visually pleasing too. Almost pretty! \n\nFor a meal and a show it was wonderfully priced!  Perfect for kids and adults.  We will definitely be back!" u'Once you look past the classic old diner decoration  you will fall in love with this place!  I have to say I had to convince the family to go and we had the best time!  The singers are amazing and many make it into shows on Broadway!   The food was okay but NYC priced. Think $150 for lunch to 5.  Super fun and worth the aitnin line!' u"It's already pretty well known that you don't come here for the food. It's a two-story diner where the servers are singers. They perform both broadway songs and popular tunes. I loved the concept and it's a whole lot of fun if you have a large fun group to go with. \n\nThe line is super long it's down the block actually so be ready to wait. The food isn't great and I expected that. I had the turkey wrap with Brie and French fries. The French fries are very good. If you like show tunes the possibility of frequent confetti showers and people singing and dancing during your meal then check this place out at least once. If it's not your thing don't bother coming in." u"It pains me to write a poor review for a SINGING restaurant because I adore the concept but after my experience here I'm left with no choice if I want to maintain my dignity as a self-proclaimed food connoisseur.\n\nTonight was my second time here and it's nothing like I remember it to be. To start rather than singing show tunes as advertised waiters were singing everything from Bruno Mars to Michael Bubl\xe9--though they sang well I came for Broadway hits not Bubl\xe9! \n\nTo make matters worse my food situation was a disaster. I ordered the Sofia Vergara (a vegetarian burrito) and wasn't pleased about paying $17 for an average burrito but oh well. When it came out I found a hair in it that looked to be from a man and it took 10 minutes to flag down my waiter to ask for another. Thankfully my waiter was apologetic and took the burrito off the check but when he brought out a replacement it was the WRONG BURRITO and had chicken in it--I'M A VEGETARIAN. At that point I didn't even know where he was to tell him so I just didn't eat and left hungry and disappointed.\n\nIf you come here don't come for the food or intimate atmosphere. Come for a party-like tourist-y environment and be ready to overpay and wait in line for it. I am all for the American dream but not if my palate suffers in the process." u'My Mom and I came here after a long day in the city.\n\nIt was COMPLETELY worth the wait.\n\nThe food was amazing!\n\nI would recommend the following:\n* South of the Border Quesadillas with Chicken.\n* Mac N\' Cheese (The cheesiest and best Mac n\' Cheese you will EVER eat).\n* Carmel Cheesecake (It has a WONDERFUL Oreo crust!)\n\nThe entertainment is simply mind blowing! I had such a fantastic time.\n\nI am so sorry that I could not remember anyone\'s name... Everyone did such an AMAZING job!\n\nI LOVED Tink\'s performance of "Popular" from Wicked. In this song she interacted with the audience a lot! I was her "Elphaba" so she would play around with me and even borrowed my sunglasses to perform with. It was the cutest thing! She is adorable and such a powerhouse performance! You made my night Tink!\n\nAlso I loved Gabby\'s performance of "Let It Go" from Frozen. I will not share any more about her performance - as to not spoil the surprise. I was blown away by her magical performance! Way to go Gabby!\n\nOur server was Lindsay. She had great recommendations and was so polite and thoughtful!\nI also LOVED her performance as Cosette in "One Day More" from Les Miserable. You\'re amazing Lindsay!\n\nI also wanted to thank the DJ for making the "Three Amigos" reference that only my table seemed to understand. That was great! \n\nI am a musical theatre fan so I mentioned all show tunes but there was a fantastic mix of old songs contemporary songs pop rock musicals etc.  \n\nIt was a perfect night! Everyone here is so talented! Keep up the great work!\n\nThank you everyone!' u"An amazing spot if you're into musical theatre   Tater tots are yummy but the performances are amazing. I went on a Sunday at 8 am and had no wait by the time we left there was a pretty long line to get in. Worth the wait though and make sure to bring cash to tip the sing staff!!" u'Recently tried Ellen\'s Stardust Diner.  A few points: you aren\'t paying for the "best food ever".  You are paying for an experience and to watch and listen to the staff perform.  Keep in mind during busy hours you might have to wait 90+ minutes for food. \n\nThe food is extremely overpriced for what it is.  It\'s good quality food but wraps that coat $15+? \n\nWe were sat in a section where the server was on break.  We didn\'t see him for 15 minutes before taking our order.  It seemed like poor planning.  Luckily we got to watch the servers perform.  \n\nThe food was ok service was decent.  If it wasn\'t for the great entertainment the review would be much different.' u"We really enjoy this place! This is more about the music and atmosphere than the food so if you aren't really into musicals and show tunes and are looking for a nice quiet place to eat then you will not like it here. It is loud!\n\nThat said the food was actually quite good. I liked the steak and eggs (and tots of course) the best and also liked the chicken pot pie. They also have some gluten free options too.\n\nIt can be very busy at peak times where you will have to wait outside and if you are a single or group of two you will get seated with others so be aware of that.\n\nWe used the Google tool to see busy times and went when it wasn't full that improves the experience quite a bit - I don't like waiting outside in lines for things even if I really like the thing.  :)\n\nThe place has a couple levels and the bathrooms are upstairs. They have drink selection and a large milkshake and dessert selection too. Also they have a few all-day breakfast options if you are into that.\n\nThe performers were really great on this trip. We have been here multiple times now and will definitely come back the next time we are in the Theater District." u"Amazing bar! Waiters singing like a broadway show's actors. It was huge line but it worth it"],0.4588,0.4,0.6,0.0
67.Briciola,[u'Fantastic... it seriously sucks that this place was so good on all fronts because I want to go in there all the time on my way home...\n\nGreat service great food and amazing ambience!\n\nCheers.' u"I wish i could give this place a 3.5 stars. The ambiance was great candlelit and very intimate. I think perhaps i had the best sauvignon blanc there. I really reccomend it!\n\nAs for the food we ordered a shrimp with lenils over polenta and the baked clams. The shrimp dish was decent but I was missing the 'italianess' of it. The baked clams were awesome they had the perfect crunch with an oregano flavor and a lemony touch.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the black truffle gnocchi and I was slightly disappointed. It honestly just tasted like mac and cheese with mushrooms topped on it. I was expecting a better dish. The sauce was just too white and you couldn't really taste the truffle in it. The dessert was great I got the chocolate souffle and it was VERY chocolatey. Definitely was delicious but I kind of wish we tried the tiramisu!" u"I had really high expectations because of the great reviews but this place fell short. First off I was kind of shocked at how small it was. It was very difficult getting on and off my stool without hitting everyone left and right of me. \n\n2 stars: Convenient bag hooks under the table since everyone had huge jackets. The wine list was very impressive and the quality of the food wasn't bad. They had a clean bathroom. \n\nWhy only 2 stars?: the portion of the pastas were so small I could've finished it in 5 bites. Inside my pasta had that stainless steel dish scrubbing thing. That pretty much ruined my meal. How did it get there in the first place? \n\n\nMy friends and I had a decent meal but we probably won't be coming back." u"HO-LY SHIT. Best restaurant we attended in NYC so far...and it was 2 blocks from our AirBnB! Visited for lunch and post Avenue Q food/drink...wish we had come for dinner as well! The owner was there both times we dropped in and was super friendly/helpful/fun/all of the above. Small location which I love because it's a get-to-know-your-neighbor kind of vibe esp in the common dinner room. \nGet your ass here if you haven't yet...do it again if you have. We may live here during our next visit and I'm not. even. kidding" u"Trendy restaurant with good food but not great for groups. \n\nPros: The food is pretty good. The Kale Salad was tasty even for a salad! the dressing was light so a good option if you're watching what you eat. The Linguine Vongole's sauce had great flavor and I enjoyed this pasta dish a lot but it's too bad that the clams in this dish were TINY. i could barely find them but still they didn't miss the mark on the flavor of this dish. We had the steak over a bed of spinach and potatoes which were decent. we asked for it medium rare and they cooked it right but i wasn't a big fan of the sauce they drizzled on top. We also had a plate of prosciutto which was as expected although the cuts were a little thick for my preference. I saw others around us ordering the prosciutto with mozzarella cheese and it looked really appetizing! In hindsight i should've ordered that instead.\n\nFor dessert we had tiramisu which was amazeballs. order it. I had the riesling which i really enjoyed as well. Unfortunately there is no happy hour here.\n\nCons: the seating is cafeteria style and you will have ZERO room between you and the people next to you so you'll be able to hear others' conversations and they'll be able to hear your's. There is barely any room for your elbows and good luck if you need to leave your seat to use the bathroom.\n\nGood pick for italian in Hell's Kitchen!" u"Excellent place to grab some wine & quality Italian food.  It's very cozy/crammed be aware of your elbows.  Wine comes in 3 different sizes: the middle size seems the best value you get 1.5-2 glasses for not much more than the price of a glass. \n\nFood is great some of my favorites are the organic kale salad (Pecorino e Kale) brussel sprouts (Cavolini) grilled eggplant (Melanzane e Caprino) and the slow-roasted wild boar pasta (Pappardelle Cinghiale).  Dessert always sounds good but I haven't yet saved room for it. \n\nKnocking a star off because I've tried to make reservations a few times and there's consistently a system error so I end up having to wait outside (they don't let you leave your name and come back) for a spot to open up." u'A really cute little place with delicious food. Was a great place for a date. Although the seating area is intimate we still felt as if we had space to ourselves and could hold conversation without everyone hearing. \n\nThe food was delicious. The $1 oysters were fresh and flavorful and the octopus appetizer was tender and also well-flavored--not over cooked or rubbery. We split truffle mac & cheese. Although it sounds basic it was a well done and with just the right amount of truffle. The cheesecake dessert was delicious! \n\nThe staff were great. They were very nice and helpful-providing good suggestions when asked. They also found my phone when I lost it and kept it for me.' u"Cute and intimate Italian restaurant with communal style dining. Came with a friend and sat at a long shared table with other people. Wouldn't bring a group here!\n\nThe octopus salad is great here highly recommend. Also got the penne pesto dish which was pretty good as well. The pesto wasn't too heavy or oily like some places. Wish it would've had a pesto option with meat or something though." u"Great find!  Enjoyed a drink and small plates after seeing Wicked at the Gershwin theater right down the street.  Monday at the bar wasn't super busy.  We split a couple small plates.  The food was delicious with quality ingredients.  \nWe split the tortelloni proscuitto with peas in a parmesan cream sauce and the lamb chops w/\nroasted potatoes.  Dishes were $14 & $12 perfect bites for a late night spot." u'Was in the area looking for a place for dinner and this came up on Yelp. From the photos it looked cute and reasonably priced. When we got there we found out that the place is super small! It is divided into two sections one where you can sit at the bar and the room over is a communal table. \n\nLoved the $1 oyster deal (ON A FRIDAY! super rare) I had ordered one of the specials for the day - the black truffle gnocchi. OH MY GOD. My taste buds went to heaven. I wish it never ended. \n\nWe arrived around 6pm but as we left the place was packed. Come early!' u'We went to this place with high expectations but my wife and I were disappointed.\nThe restaurant is tiny the "waiter" that served us wasn\'t nice he almost pushed us to drink something (wine).\nI asked him if he can change the sauce on the gnocchi and he said yes when I received the dish the portion was for a kid and the flavor was just ok.\nThen when I received the check they charged me $9 yes $9 for a sauce that wasn\'t that good.( he told me a different amount $4 extra) I didn\'t complain because the waiter was coky and he though he was better than everyone and I can\'t handle that kind of people.\nI never write bad reviews but this place deserve it.' u"Briciola is the type of restaurant I always see in movies. It's adorable and nicely decorated with Christmas lights outside. The inside has wine bottles as decorations on the walls. There's two sections to the restaurant both of which have one long table that you share with other people. The tables are not for individual parties but it's cool sharing a table with others. It's a very small space but it's enough. \n\nIn terms of food we got the spinach ravioli with artichokes and the gnocchi with truffle oil (one of the specials). Both of these were bursting with flavor! The only downfall was that the ravioli was a really small proportion. We also got the chocolate souffl\xe9 which was fresh out of the oven and melted in our mouths! I just wish they gave a little more ice cream with the souffl\xe9. Overall great place to try!" u"This place looks extremely charming from the outside and probably makes for a great Instagram post but otherwise it is not quite that great.\n\nFirst of all I wasn't a big fan of the setup. It 's more 'wine cellar with one table' than 'wine bar'. Also some level of noise is to be expected but people to the left and right were so loud that it was quite hard to make conversation. Not an intimate ambiance anymore when your neighbors voices drown out your own.\n\nWine options here are plentiful as advertised. We had a couple of glasses of red and they were quite good. The food here is just alright though. We really liked the Crostini Porchetta which was tasty and well seasoned. However the pastas were quite bland. The truffle gnocchi (special) hardly had any truffle taste in it. The Ricotta ravioli tasted better but it was a too dense. \n\nIt was disappointing since we expected a lot more from the place after reading all the rave reviews. Cute concept in theory but there are many better Italian places you can go to." u'My favorite local Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. I just love the quality of the food here. This cute place is pretty small so sharing table with different people is considered the norm. Came here with a friend for her belated birthday and we were seated in a bar covered with white tiles. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The wait was about half hour on a Tuesday night. For drinks we got a glass of champagne. For the appetizer we got the Torino di Granchio e Funghi. That is a crab & shrimp cake with mushroom. The flavor was just right and the texture was very tender. For the entree I ordered the Fettuccine at Funghi and it was perfect. Will definitely be back to try out more dishes!!' u'Stumbled upon this place and what a treat! This small and cozy wine bar had a superb wine list and amazing food. Ordered the orecchiette salssicia rapini and it was perfect. Delicious flavor and just the right portion for its richness. Very reasonable prices for wine and food. Was able to sample a couple wine options based on suggestions from the server based on my taste preference. A perfect spot for a solo traveler or a couple on a date. I highly recommend giving this place a try.' u"Briciola is a great place if you're looking for a casual quality Italian restaurant. While the restaurant is very cozy with a bar in one room and a single elongated table in the other it makes for a homey environment. However because it is so small you will be sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with other customers during your meal.\n\nAs for the food it was extremely affordable and of high quality where my friend and I really enjoyed the linguine with clams and the lobster ravioli. For the quality of food that is served the prices are very affordable with entrees starting at $12 in addition to your meal coming with complementary bread. I would definitely recommend Briciola for a casual meal/date." u"I went there in 30th October so the restaurant was decorated for Halloween! It was not a real spider web lol. The staff was so kind. And salads with rooster and gnocchi tasted truffle were very good. It was a little pricy (especially gnocchi) but it's ok. We didn't order wines but they had a good wine list. I would like to try it next time!" u"Great family owned Italian restaurant! Came here based on the yelp reviews of top 10 Italian restaurants in HK. I was craving Italian and I'm Glad I came here.\nWhat I had...\n\nAppetizer: \nCrostini di pulpo (octopus on bread)- loved that the crostini was soft. I hate it when the crostini is too toasted and scrapes the roof of my palate. The tomato pesto and the octopus was the perfect blend.\n\nEntree:\nLasagne bolognese (meat lasagna)- this dish is definitely not plain Jane at all! If you love lasagna you'll like this one. It's Very cheesy meaty and just the right portion size. The portion may look small but it's a heavy dish.\n\nGarganelli osso bucco (tube shaped pasta with osso bucco)- This dish was delicious. It tasted like an osso bucco stew with pasta. The meat was tender was and the dish was surprisingly light.\n\nTip: If you're coming in just for drinks you have to sit adjacent to the bar. Bar tops are for diners only.\nIt's space is pretty limited so it's not ideal for big groups." u"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The bar is super narrow and reminds you that you're in one of the most crowded yet amazing metropolitan cities in the country. Their original restaurant has one Barry dining room adjacent to the bar area and you feel like you're dining in a winery in Europe. Old wine bottles and candles decorate the walls surrounding the one communal table. \n\nThe food is AMAAAAAZING! Come with friends so you can order several dishes to share. I will be back here next time I'm in the city. Along with The Smith restaurants this has made my TOP PLACES IN NYC list. Make sure to make a reservation." u"Great pre theater meal with my family. We were there early so it wasn't crowded. The house made gnocchi with truffle cream sauce stole the show. The lobster avocado and arugula salad and burrata and prosciutto were solid starters. The wine list is limited and the plates should have been heated to keep food hot while sharing."],-0.2263,0.0,0.899,0.101
2.Carmine’s Italian Restaurant - Times Square,[u"Still one of the best family style Italian restaurants around! Came with the boyfriend after a show and were quickly able to get seats though it was pretty packed as always.\n\nFood: 5/5\n\nLove their bread basket- such a variety of options and the best is the marinara one (aka Pizza bread).\n\nSpicy Scarpariello Wings- it caught our eye this particular evening and the waitress insisted on its flavor packed goodness. She was right! These wings not what this place is known for mind you were pretty amazing! Garlicky tangy slightly sweet juicy wings definitely worth a try. \n\nLinguine w/ white clam sauce- we literally always get this dish because it is just so good! Love their fresh plump clams and their sauce is just so light yet flavorful. Be warned their pasta portions are extremely generous.\n\nChicken Parmigiana- the weakest of all the dishes nothing particularly amazing... the chicken was dry and there wasn't enough sauce. There are better chicken dishes to try here even the wings.\n\nWe had plenty of leftovers to take home for next day lunches- which are still good a day old!\n\nAmbience: 5:5\nIt is a very popular restaurant so expect lots of people noise and a bit of a wait; but given that this is a hot spot in Times Square service is relatively quick and efficient." u'Great food and Awesome NYC experience.  Not over the top but definitely what we needed after a long day of walking.  Food is served "family style" and it tasted great !  Portions are large so be warned !\nIf I was a local this would be one of my weekly hangouts.\n\nWe\'ll go back..' u"This restaurant was ok. It's in the heart of time square so expect a long wait and for it to be crowded. I highly recommend a reservation  we had one for Sunday night and were seated within a few minutes which was great. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and do a great job of explaining how the menu works however after we got our food there were times we couldnt find our waiteress. We needed clean plates and utensils after ours were cleared after the first course. \n\nThis restaurant is family style with each dish serving 2-3 people. It's definitely a lot of food and I recommend coming here with a large group. The prices are fair for the amount of food you get. We had the house salad for the table (I really liked the dressing) and we got the eggplant parm.  For the parm definitely ask for extra sauce on the side because it seemed to be lacking on the dish itself. There is also an unlimited bread basket of some great breads. \n\nOverall personally I'm not a huge fan of family style especially if you have very differing tastes at your table and I think you can get better Italian food in little Italy but carmines is definitely an experience so if you have a large group come with empty stomachs and enjoy!" u"Carmine's is always a great place to grab a family style meal with family or friends or both either after a Broadway show or if you want to share a couple of Italian dishes with a few great folks. \n\nI have never taken the time to review it but my family and I stopped in for a quick lunch a few days ago. \n\nSome tips it does look pricey at first glance but keep in mind although each dish is about $30+ the meals are meant to be shared each dish will feed 5-6 people. So order up several things and share away. We had four people in our party and took home plenty of left overs. Another tip early lunch may not require a reservation but anytime past 3pm and on I suggest making a reservation. \n\nThe staff is very kind and accommodating. We were seated immediately this time. \nWe ordered the huge fried calamari lasagna and chicken Parmesan. They also offer a large basket of mixed house made breads. We never have room for dessert ever. \n\nSo if you are celebrating something or just in the mood for family style you will never go wrong with Carmine's." u"I really don't understand what the fuss is about. \n\nThe food is good and the service is fine but why would anyone eat in a place packed with tourists? for alright Italian food? where they are basically rushing you out the door before the next reservation starts? when we are literally in the largest food hub in the world...\n\nIf you're going to go the eggplant parm was good but it needs a side order of sauce." u"My wife and I were in Manhattan for a show and decided to dine at Carmine's. We had reservations for 6:30 but we arrived early and were seated in just a few minutes. They brought us upstairs and were seated at a table for 2 a very quaint area of the restaurant. It felt very comfortable and inviting. The d\xe9cor resembles a nice Italian eatery.  \n\nOur Waitress Ana came over introduced herself and took our order. She was efficient and did not rush us so we can enjoy our meal and each other.\n\nWe have eaten here several times and it has always been great. We know about their huge family style portions so we just ordered the Fried Calamari and a bottle of wine. Since we were going to a show we didn't want any leftovers. We love their Calamari it's one of the best we have ever had so it's one of our favorites.  We enjoyed our food and wine immensely and were full. Had a pleasant evening even speaking with other patrons.  Just an overall good experience. \n\nCarmine's is always a good choice great food at a fair price and good service. That's why there always busy." u'One of the best old school Italian restaurants I\'ve been to. It\'s in the heart of Times Square. The decor reminds me of something from The Godfather bright ornate chandeliers- lots of tables. Everything is served "family style" for the table to share. Be careful with over ordering it\'s a lot of food! I love the shrimp linguini in garlic & olive oil sauce chicken Marsala and rigatoni & meatballs - amazing! VERY pricey though! Stills must if in NYC!!' u"As I sit here in Carmine's Italian Restaurant I cant help but praise the amazing food I just digested!  The Hubby and I ordered the Salmon Scarpariello with added angel hair pasta as suggested by our waiter.  Seriously it is the best Italian food I've had in my life.  Not even kidding!  The portions are HUGE folks enough for three or four people to share.  They serve family sized meals so choose wisely.  Do yourself a favor and make your way to Carmine's whenever you're in the big apple!" u'This is leaning towards a 5 star.. but since it is only based off 1 thing ordered I will refrain.\n\nFirst they are open late - which is a plus. Second location is right on Times Square.. nice and central. Third they text you when your table is ready so if there is a long wait like we had you can check out the surrounding entertainment - super convenient!\n\nSince my husband is very strict about what he  does and does not eat because of his diet our out-of-town or "going out" meals have mainly consisted of seafood steak and lobster. I live a rough life I know.\n\nHere we went with the porterhouse and ordered it contadina style served over roasted potatoes onions and peppers with sausage.\n\nA good thing to know before you go is that all meals are served family style one dish or salad is enough for 4-5 people. Hence the porthouse is the cut they serve here since you basically end up with a filet and a strip all on one bone. \n\nThe steak is rubbed with oil garlic and parsley and then broiled.. its very juicy yet crispy on the outside. Size wise it is ridiculously large.. but luckily we were very hungry!' u"I am visiting the NYC area for work and a co-worker recommended Carmen's.  I sat at the bar since I was alone and Trinidad was my server.  He was excellent and was very interesting!  The menu features mainly family-sized entrees but Trinidad recommended several options for someone dining alone.  So I took his recommendation of Chicken Lemon & Butter Sauce without the pasta.  While waiting for my entree I ate a LOT of their excellent bread.  Having been to Rome and the surrounding areas this summer and having been disappointed with the bread there I was very happy to find that the bread at this Italian restaurant was so good.  The entree was VERY good.  Carmine's has a great ambience and was hopping on a Tuesday night.  If you're in the area I highly recommend this excellent restaurant." u"Low rating because of my experience \n\nI really really wanted to like this place \nI was so excited to go here I love pasta. Who doesn't?!\n\nI made our reservation for 11 I wasn't sure what time the show would be done. We ended up at the resturtant at 10 they had a 45 minute wait so we walked around. We came back at 1040 and they seated us right away.\n\nI ordered the processco in a quart ($15). My boyfriend got a beer.\n\nWe got the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce since I'm a vegetarian. \n\nIt came out in about 10 minutes not too bad a wait. \n\nI had about one plate of it then I realized there was a chunk that resembled meat. I had my boyfriend try it to make sure. He said it definietly was meat. I dug around my plate and he looked through his and sure enough there was meat everywhere. \n\nI told the waiter and he was confused how the meat got in there since it was marinara. At first he didn't believe us I was like then try this chunk of meat which he couldn't do. \n\nThe manager came by to apologize and said they were bringing out another plate of just marinara. She said the bolognase looks like marinara sauce... We didn't want it anymore since I felt sick and couldn't even think about eating. \n\nThey took off the pasta from the bill so we just paid for the drinks ($24).\n\nHonestly that shouldn't gave happened especially at a place where the prices are so high and is very established. I am really disappointed and really had high hopes for carmines." u'This place is ALWAYS packed.  Reservations recommended or patience at the door. Huge bar to wait at or in my case dine at. \nRule of thumb dishes are FAMILY style= huge portions.  As a party of one a goody bag was what I left with along with a full belly. \nOpted for the beet n goat cheese salad and the Caprese Salad.  All very huge!' u'Omg! Italian family style!!\nOne block off the square!! Say no more and reasonably priced.' u"Love the festive feel of this restaurant! All dishes served family style and perfect for large family or friend gatherings as well as work/team events. As a resident of NYC I typically avoid the Times Square area (fighting my way out of the crowds can be like Escape the Room maybe even harder). However I also love Broadway shows; when my family visits around the holidays they love Carmine's for the scenery the bustling vibe which encapsulates Manhattan and the mega-sized desserts. Carmine's prices are fair and probably average out to less per head than going to a non family style Italian restaurant in the same part of the city. \n\nThe last time I was here my party of seven and I were seated at 8 finished eating drinking and conversing at 10:30 and as we were leaving I noticed the long line of families waiting to be seated for dinner even at 10:30pm at night - proof of this restaurant's reputation! It is certainly popular amongst tourists. However I would also remind NYCers to have a meal here if they haven't yet!!" u"Back when I lived in NY whenever I wanted great Italian food but didn't want to go all the way to Queens I went to Carmine's (both locations) several times a year.  The food was always tasty prices were reasonable portions were huge and eating family-style was fun.  \n\nOn a recent trip to NYC with the family we had reservations for a dinner on a Friday night.  We were seated right on time.  \n\nIf your eyesight isn't great you'll need to put on some glasses to see the menu boards which are placed on the walls throughout the restaurant.  The waiter did a good job of rattling off the specials of the day though. \n\nIt was still fun eating family-style but the food was overly salty (although still fresh with good flavor) portion was still big and the prices were high although not outrageous by any means.  The service was decent and the restaurant was crowded and as loud as I remembered.  \n\nIf you have a larger group and like to eat family style in a hectic noisy place this is still a good place.  If you're looking for a romantic evening for two there are better options in Manhattan." u"First time here in almost 20 years. And you know what . . ? I think it's better NOW. We were a party of 11 loved ones. We ordered the Chicken Parmesan Porterhouse Contadina (steak with Italian sausage peepers and onions) the fried calamari the shrimp linguine the Caesar salad the Lasagna and the salmon with oysters. Everything was absolute fire. Oh and I had a Blue Moon too; wifey ordered a Sicilian Moscow Mule. Our total bill was $450 which is a bit pricey but for a four-star Italian restaurant in the heart of Times Square that sent each in our party home with leftovers it was worth every penny. As I type this out I'm already trying to figure out how this So-Cal foodie is going to make his next return visit here." u'W o a h.\n\nI went to see Wicked with my aunt and best friend while on vacation in New York and I was blown away by Carmine\'s afterward. \n\nOk it\'s pricey ($300 for the three of us). And yes we didn\'t need that much food for 3 people. BUT I\'m on vacation and we party hard.\n\nWe got the calamari and the cheesy garlic bread to start. And then two lobsters over a huge bed of penne for the main course. Oh and a massive pitcher of sangria. The waitress was like "you\'re making a mistake that is so much food". We had no regrets.\n\nThe calamari was delicious and perfectly fried. The cheesy bread was so sinful but I just HAD to have two. But the star was the lobster and the penne. I could probably say the penne itself was some of the best I\'ve had (and I\'m Italian). But the lobster was to die for.\n\nIf you have a big group - GO! You will wait for a table but it\'s totally worth it.' u'Great family style restaurant!  Delicious and great price.  Plates are huge.  Chicken Parm good enough to share between 4-6.  Enjoyed very much!' u"Hands down best Italian food restaurant I've tried . It's family style so make sure you go family style or with a group of friend  we tried penne a la Vodka  the antipasto salad and spaghetti carbonara and they were all delish" u'Huge portion! We ordered lemon chicken spaghettini with garlic and clams in garlic were delicious! The two order was enough for five of us (adults). My brother is a very picky eater and ended up ordered another clams in garlic. \n\nThe ambience is very family oriented. Price is not that bad and the server was great. \nIf you craving Italian this is not a bad place to go!'],0.484,0.239,0.761,0.0
47.Luke’s Lobster Times Square,[u"Lobster roll was pretty moist. It is really good and was straight lobster. There weren't any fillers. \n\nThe lobster seemed fresh and freshly caught. Bread was a soft typical white bread. \n\nThey also serve classic Maine sodas including blueberry lemonade" u"Lobster rolls are up there on my favorite foods ever list so my standards are fairly high. Luke's lobster is served cold without mayo  on a warm bun. \n\nThe $17 price tag is a little high for the amount of lobster even if it does taste fresh. I really prefer my lobster to be warmer and with a little butter either drizzled on top or on the side neither was the case with Luke's. \n\nService was fast and we sat on stools at a counter as the one table was occupied." u"Ordered the trio. The sign that says the trio isn't meant for sharing is 100% correct. I've had lobster rolls before but I was completely thrown off with the rolls I got here. The meat tasted fresh but extremely ICE COLD! I love eating cold things but the coldness in the rolls was too much. I was also disappointed with the clam chowder. All the food was mediocre. I won't visit a Luke's Lobster again after this experience. \n\nThe establishment is located on the second floor and the bathrooms are located on the basement level." u"I've been itching to try Luke's Lobster so the location at City Kitchen was the perfect opportunity without the crazy wait. Ok there was still a wait but definitely much better than I could have expected from a sit-down restaurant.\n\nAfter ordering my food the wait was torturous. However I was excited to get my two orders of Luke's Trio (1/2 crab roll 1/2 lobster roll 1/2 shrimp roll) and lobster bisque. After we scored a table for 4 we dug in. We weren't super hungry so this portion was perfect for 4 people. The lobster roll and crab roll were on point the shrimp not so much. Each roll was chock-full of fresh seafood which was what I expect with the price I paid with the exception of the shrimp. Yes there was plenty of shrimp but the meat itself was meh. The lobster bisque had a nice kick with enough bits of lobster meat in it to feel like I got my money's worth. \n\nYes it's pricey. Seating also kind of sucks at the City Kitchen. But it was a quick and painless meal without being overly filling." u'It was an okay lobster roll and was kinda pricey for the roll.\n\nLocation: it is located inside City Kitchen in timesquare. There is a lot of seats and it is a food court style so you have to order and look for a seat. Very clean. It is located on the second floor so you have to take the stairs or elevator.\n\nService: The server is okay. Not really friendly.\n\nFood: The lobster roll was okay not something that I will come back for. It is kinda pricey too $17 for a very small roll. The roll could fit in my hand. I was actually shocked when I saw the roll. The lobster is well seasoned you could taste the butter as well. The roll is soft and as what I said you could taste the butter. For drinks try the Maine blueberry lemonade it was refreshing.\n\nAgain I will not come back for more. I think it is too pricey for a small lobster roll.' u'While staying in the city i decided ti try a lobster roll with clam chowder. The soup was flavorful but the lobster roll was really really sad. The meat was not the freshest sad little claw meat nothing spectacular. I would not go back.' u"Just because you have to be at the office instead of at the beach doesn't mean you can't indulge in some vacation fare.  This is way better than an unimaginative salad or sandwich in the area but doesn't quite stack up against other purveyors of shellfish rolls.  It's fine to satisfy a craving but that's about the extent of it.  The lobster roll is by far the best roll choice of the three.\n\nLobster Roll: I'm a big fan of Connecticut-style rolls with warm lobster and drawn butter and nothing else.  Their's obviously wasn't that style but it wasn't bad either.  I'm glad they were very judicious about mayo use.  Not my ideal but fine for a fix.\n\nCrab Roll: A bit meh.  Didn't see any large chunks of crab just small flakes.  Not much going in terms of additional sauces/spices.  I'm glad they didn't dress it like a tuna fish sandwich but still lacked a bit of umph.\n\nShrimp Roll: The most disappointing of the trio.  The shrimp were too small and had a slimy texture.  They felt like only a small upgrade above bay shrimp." u"Pretty awful experience in this location. \n\nI'm usually a fan of Luke's Lobster. Though it's overpriced I can appreciate a quick-service fresh lobster roll and bisque. I came to this location in the hopes of getting fresh food but turned out to be the opposite. \n\nFirst this location is in City Kitchen in Times Square. There's a few other restaurants in this food court but it's easy to find. There were three people working which all of them were on their phones the entire time I tried to order. The person at the counter was on his phone and refused to look at me when I tried to request my order. He kept looking down on his phone as well as his coworkers even though I was asking about the menu. \n\nI ordered the clam chowder lobster bisque and skipped on the roll because of how rude the workers were. I asked for utensils and napkins and still the workers were on their phone and refusing to 1) answer and 2) look up. \n\nBoth items were disappointing. The bisque was too salty much more than their other locations and the clam chowder was very watered down. And not that much seafood in it. \n\nI would not suggest going to this location." u'Last time I was in New York City my main regret was not eating enough lobster. \xa0 \xa0 \n\nFirst lunch in the city in a year and we head for Luke\'s Lobster Times Square.\n\nPlace is upstairs in this building called City Kitchen. \xa0 Turned out to be a food kitchen with half a dozen very upscale fast food restaurants. \xa0 \n\nWe checked out Luke\'s Lobster and it\'s basic menu: bottled drink with chips and pickle with \nshrimp $12 crab $16 lobster $19. \xa0Add a soup to the combo for $4 more. \xa0Line up at the counter place your order pay find a seat wait for your number and pick up your order. \xa0Common seating on long benches among the half dozen restaurants in the food court.\n\nPlace was packed and noisy with very few open tables available and those tables covered with food and drink debris from the previous occupant -one star deducted for poor service keeping open tables clean. \xa0Lots of people seemed to be nursing a drink enjoying the view down below oblivious to those people with full meals looking for an open table in short supply.\n\nWe managed to get a table but had to sweep all the food debris onto the floor and put other people\'s garbage away -habits of locals! \xa0 Welcome to New York City! \xa0Not the best of ambiance for a hot date but after 13 years of marriage my wife is very accommodating. \n\nWe get our order one $17 lobster sandwich one $19.50 Luke\'s trio and one $9 lobster bisque soup.  I tried to order the clam chowder but they were starting a new batch cooking and it would be awhile. \xa0\n\nTable for six people we on one end another pair in the middle and a third party pair on the far end.  Got to make do with the surroundings and the other two pairs were pairs of young ladies next to us old fart seniors.    \n\nThe lobster bisque is about 12 ounces with hunks of lobster throughout although not as fresh as the lobster in the sandwiches.\n\nThe lobster sandwich is about 6" long with large hunks of fresh lobster soaked in butter with no mayonnaise like you see in California.  Bread is also a bit salty with the seasonings.. \n\nLuke\'s trio comes with 1/2 crab sandwich 1/2 shrimp sandwich and 1/2 lobster sandwich.    \n\nThe crab on a bun is also excellent not too salty with crab from the body not the more desirable leg area and not saturated with mayo as we see in California.  About a 3" bun for the 1/2 sandwiches.  \n\nWith tax total order comes to $52 out the door.  \n\nExcellent meal but pricey for what you get and I\'ve tasted better crab sandwiches but not too often. \xa0Never had a lobster roll before  and so can\'t compare it. \xa0Serving size is small for the price.  Gives new meaning to "gone in sixty seconds".' u"I love Luke's Lobster! It was the best lobster  roll I ever had! There was so much lobster in one rolls! I felt like I was in heaven! I can't wait to go back to NYC to eat this again!" u'I went here with my girlfriend. We ate a seafood pasta clam chowder and lobster bisque! The clam chowder is the best ! The past is a little bit garlicky...!' u"Very small lobster roll for 17.00 dollars. They put a good amount of lobster in the small bun but dang!! I know that NYC is notorious for over pricing things but this was a bit of a let down. Especially since I know what a lobster roll is suppose to look and taste like. This was mediocre \n\nIt wasn't bad but it definitely will not be sought after if I ever make my way to   NY again. I  enjoyed  the sand which all three bites of it." u"The food is fantastic no questions about that. If you got a little bit more for the cost it would absolutely be 5 stars. \n\nThat's the only flaw everything else is amazing. Very well crafted bites with tasty seafood crunchy rolls and a salty topping. I actually prefer the crab roll the most here as you do get a good amount of fresh cool crab in that crunchy toasted roll and a nice contrast with salty seasoning. It really is a great bite. \n\nThe location is in a kitchen market with nice seating along the windows to enjoy your meal. Check it out!" u"You can never go wrong with Luke's trio! Start with the shrimp roll follow with the crab & finish with the lobster. The flavor consistently gets better. Don't be fooled by the size. Small portions but very filling!" u"I've wanted to try Luke's for a while now and I finally had the opportunity to visit the one in the City Kitchen food market. I went on a Sunday afternoon and there was surprisingly a lot of seating. \n\nI opted just for the classic Lobster Roll ($16). The lobster roll comes in a small box (which is good especially if you can't find seating very quickly in City Kitchen) on buttery and crispy bread. The cold lobster itself had a great flavor - the dressing was nice and light so the flavor of the fresh lobster meat was really apparent. \n\nI wish that the rolls were a little bigger because I would definitely have appreciated a bit more for the price. I definitely want to visit again and try the Lobster Bisque." u'My favorite lobster roll place. I found this place in Boston and it has become my all time favorite for roll. Highly recommend =) a little pricy given the quantity of the food so i gave 4 stars. But quality is 5 stars' u"I had Luke's lobster roll today for lunch. It was as good as the five star ratings given by other reviewer's it was deliciously seasoned and fresh and that's all you can ask for in the lobster roll no fillers or anything yucky all lobster wonderful!" u"When comes down to lobster rolls Luke's is definitely somewhere high on the list. Unlike Red Hook which focuses on lobster rolls in different styles Luke's is simple and straightforward - lobster crab or shrimp make your choice. \n\nPretty generous in terms of quantity and as you took each bite of the roll the lobster chunk started to fall off. We did not get a chance to try their clam chowder yet it was on my list next time visiting. \n\nMultiple locations in the city. Location closer by - the one in Plaza Food Hall near central park." u"If I were to rate this place on their Lobster Bisque alone it would be 4 stars. So delicious but I WANT MORE. More in the sense that even the large is a pretty tiny cup and I want more lobster. Not nearly enough for $11.\n\nService is kind of slow and isn't exceptionally friendly and they completely lost (forgot?) about my friends order then tried to say maybe someone else took it... when they definitely didn't call her number.\n\nPrices are steep but it is what it is when you're paying for lobster.\n\nOverall great food and amazingly delicious lobster bisque (I mean I really can't get over it) but I'd prefer more lobster since I'm paying for it anyway. *shrugs*\n\nI'd go back for that bisque though if I were in the mood and had a chunk of money to frivolously spend." u"Pretty decent lobster sammich. Wouldn't say the best I've had but if you haven't had one before give it a try! Got some chips and drink for a deal. If I had to get it again I'd share a sandwich here and get some soap"],0.296,0.145,0.855,0.0
13.Sweet Churros With Coffeed,[u"BEST CHURROS EVER. \n\nI was only in the area for the weekend and I had to come here twice!! \n\n--Matcha crunch with soft serve: absolutely amazing. Biting into the churro was the best food moment of my life. It was perfectly fried and it wasn't greasy or overly sweet. The cold soft swerve and warm churro is an amazing combination. I also love matcha so the matcha crunch just topped off the churro. I'm sure without the matcha it'd taste just as great. \n\nTo add to my great experience the staff was so nice and funny. \n\nI left extremely happy and wanting more! I will be back when I'm in NY again." u'churros for dessert? "Churro-k" with me!\n\nwe got:\nchurro sampler: 15$\n\noriginal -cinnamon -these were so good it will def test your self discipline to resist the "SINnamon" if youre on a diet\n\nstrawberry-this was not my favorite. too sweet for me but my friend liked it a lot. \n\nmatcha-this and me were a "matcha" made in heaven. so good\n\nchocolate and almond- this was my FAVORITE. you can never go wrong with chocolate and churro. I was "nuts" about it' u"Honestly the hype about this place didn't match my expectations. I wasn't thoroughly impressed with how our churros came out. They were not crispy or even moderately warm. They were dry with moderate flavor. We got the churro sampler platter which was around $10. We tried the matcha strawberry and chocolate almond. My personal favorite was the chocolate almond if I were to choose one. And if I were you I would get it with ice cream. So even though I wasn't impressed I'm sure others will be. If you're in the area and in a churro mood give it a shot. But personally I would look at more options." u"Freaking uh-mazing!! The best churros I have had in the city hands down. Don't let the price discourage you from trying them at least once. I can't write a longer review right now because I'm dying in this NYC heat. I'm melting like a crayon!" u"So much yes.  Churros are amazing  guys at the stand were bad ass and wasn't too pricey" u"This was fantastic! I am a Churro fan so it's very hard to go wrong for me but the Churro was not too sweet and it was just crisp enough. I also got it with the ice cream and while I am not the biggest ice cream fan this ice cream was delicious! So thick and creamy and unlike any other ice cream I've had. Not to mention the service was quick and so friendly. I hope this pop-up shop stays for awhile because I need to go back!" u"Not the best churro we've had but above average you'll find anywhere on the east coast. The pricing is moderate considering this is New York City. \n\nSpecifically request a FRESH churro of your liking with extra toppings of your liking. If you request fresh churro with extra topping you're looking at a 5 Star churro my friends." u"One of the best churros I have had! Must try when you're in NYC. We got one plain churro and one chocolate almond and I can say that the chocolate almond was amazing. Great snack to munch on while you're walking around Times Square!" u'Fresh churro (still warm!) and for a decent price ($5) especially given their location in Times Square. I ordered the Chocolate Almond Crispy Churro - not overly sweet but just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I went on a Saturday around 11am and there was no line at all - plus there were seats available right in front. Nice guys too!' u"Great coffee but they didn't have churros for breakfast seems they only have them on specific days and times. Also nothing else but churros if you are looking for a complete breakfast. But try the caramel macchiato better than Starbucks!"],0.4926,0.313,0.687,0.0
146.Pelicana Chicken,[u"Between Olive BBQ chicken and Pelicana I prefer Pelicana. \n\nI get it it's in Food Gallery and a trek to go up the stairs. Yes it's a bit pricey for being inside Food Gallery but hey at least it's tastey!\n\nWhat I love about this spot is the crispy outer skin and the soft not dry meat. Even better? They don't drown it in sauce so you can really taste the meat and it's not too salty. (Ask for the sauce on the side if you can!) \n\nEven better? They provide finger gloves to help you grab the chicken! Yup meaning no more greasy fingers!\n\nAlso tried the truffle fries which were cut thin and whatever but c'mon it's a chicken store! Not a French fry shop!" u"My friend told me about this place and we decided to check it out since it is brand new and part of the Food Gallery 32 in K-town. First impression: cute bar set up but I wish they were in a spot where it was easier to spot. I guess it's also the colors of the decor that didn't make the place pop out so I couldn't see it.\n\nI was excited when I saw the fried chicken and truffle fries that we ordered. We ordered half chicken and honestly--it was a lot! The amount seemed a lot because of how large the pieces are! As for the fries--oh man I thought it wasn't bad. I wish I could taste a bit more of the truffle but the amount of fries they give you are quite generous (definitely worth the price you pay for). I also think their signature sauce goes very well with their fried chicken.\n\nTo be honest--when I went I've actually been craving for fried chicken for a good while. So you can imagine how happy I was when I encountered some yummy fried chicken mmmmm. I would definitely come back because I want to try the other flavors and sauces that they offer. I just don't find it fair to base my review on only the first impression so I guess you'll have to stay tuned.\n\nBut so far--yes. It's a yes. I do recommend this place!" u"I'm pretty surprised this place has such good reviews so far. Sadly I forgot to take a picture since I was pretty hungry then had to wait half an hour for my food. This place is pretty average. I got the crispy boneless half. It's a generous portion but it does set you back a bit. There are plenty of other places in K-town with equal or better quality at lower prices. \n\nOn the plus side service was super friendly and the girl behind the register kindly went over the different options with me. You do get little tickets where if you collect five for free fries or ten for free chicken. However I won't be returning unless it is to try a beer float or the fries." u"Quick note the chicken here is so crispy and tastes so delicious! Some of the greatest I've had in a long while so I will be sure to come back and update my review. Wait was No issue at all. 15-20 minutes for fresh fried chicken? I'd gladly wait. Great job guys make sure you keep up the great work! \n\n-try the Pa-Dak. Korean style with green onions shaved on the top. Authentic and delicious." u"We found this place accidentally while on a Korean fried chicken crawl. We googled and yelped but nothing showed up. SUPER PSYCHED we decided to pull up to the bar as one of the first customers!  FYI this place is in the food court on the 3rd floor.\n\nWe talked to the manager and found out the grand opening was recent and he gave us some excellent personalized service.\n\nWe ordered the wings in original flavor without the sauce some parm fries and a grapefruit hefeweizen.\n\nWings came out piping hot and crunchy.  The meat was moist and juicy.  We loved the fries! Besides being crispy the parmesan made the fries more buttery than cheesy Got to love that buttery tasting fries over peanut or veggie oiled fry.  The side of slaw was creamy but wasn't drippy went of dressing. It had a nice crunch also.  The cabbage was not in shreds but instead diced.  To top off the meal we got a grapefruit hef. Its 50% hef and 50% grapefruit juice. It's both grapefruit refreshing while giving a slight buzz to people who hate beer.  You can also get the grapefruit beer as a frozen tropical drink.\n\nExcellent find IMO. We will definitely have to come back for the other stickier wings." u'The first Manhattan location of the rapidly expanding Pelican Chicken chain just opened inside Food Gallery 32 in Koreatown.\n\nThey make some excellent chicken as good as all the other chains around here. Try the Pelicana Signature Chicken and definitely get some Yellow Snowing Cheese Fries to go with it.\n\nThis is a great spot for some quick satisfying food and perfectly located across from Spot Dessert Bar for dessert on the top floor.' u'Excited! Always wanted to try this place out but didn\'t want to travel all the way to Queens. Flavors were on point! \n\nMy friend and I shared the boneless chicken full size "roughly 20 pieces" and we did half with honey garlic sauce and half with snow white. We also shared tuffle oil fries. \n\nHoney Garlic (4/5) - A tad too sweet for my taste but the flavoring was great. The garlic was there and obviously the honey flavored. \n\nSnow white (3.5/5) - Parmesan cheese. Yummy. A bit dry but that\'s okay. \n\nTruffle Oil Fries (4/5) - Cripsy! Tasty! Not too strong of tuffle flavor.' u"Pricy pricy pricy for the quality of chicken. \nThe sauces are very hit or miss and can drown out any enjoyment of the chicken. The Signature sauces are akin to duck sauce sweet and not appealing to my palette. Since this location is in ktown I do not recommend the signature sauce. The hot smoky chicken is a tasty spicy and has a reasonable punch for people who can't handle much spice. I actually liked the original with nothing since the chicken had some flavor. \n\nBack to the price though each piece costs about $2-3! The whole chicken is chicken pieces cut up into wing sized portions. It is not just a fried version of a rotisserie chicken. \n\nTruffle fries are meh.\n\nThey also ran a promotion for 10% off for the first week but I'm not sure how $3 is 10% of $50... for all the hype of the facebook event promoting this place there were not many people ordering." u"This place is a nice addition to the food court. It's on the second floor right across from Spot and is a decent choice to grab some fried chicken if you're in the mood for it and don't feel like going to one of the many other restaurants that serve it in this area. It's a less formal atmosphere (food court) but the chicken took about 20-30 minutes to be ready and you could see 4-5 other parties waiting around the same time for their chicken. We ordered two types (original and honey garlic) and the truffle fries. All of them were definitely very good and good quality ingredients. The original and fries came out steaming hot while the honey garlic was barely warm. Would go again if with a group who were in the mood for different foods/food court setting was a benefit but there are many other restaurants to get good if not better fried chicken around here." u"While I was eating my 'salad' I found a piece of plastic so I brought it up to the cash register but she didn't do anything about it. My rice was half cold and somewhat warm. The chicken was good but food is pricey. I found it ridiculous when I saw that radish was $1 extra when it's usually free... Food took over 15-20min so I became kind of impatient. Overall I wouldn't come back unless I'm having a huge craving." u"Unfortunately this place was a huge miss.. we had the chicken sandwiches and they were so disappointing. Took a long time to make and the portion is tiny.. not to mention overpriced. I took a bite and really didn't feel like taking another. The flavors were odd and a little off. Do yourself a favor and just go to Chick Fil A a few blocks away- way cheaper and tastes fantastic! Waffle fries to boot."],0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
119.Bar Bacon,[u'Bacon + beer = happiness.\n\nEverything on the menu is bacon oriented and they sport a great beer selection to complement all that pork belly.  \n\nBeers were definitely in order and I went for one of the IPAs on the menu - no surprise for me.  My wife ordered a brown ale from Cigar City Brewing Company in Tampa FL - one of our favorites that we did not expect in NYC.  It was excellent and wound up being a great pairing with the bacon that was to come.\n\nWe ordered the bacon flight and enjoyed the different flavors of glaze on offer.  For mains she ordered the Bacon Grilled Cheese and I ordered the Bacon Caesar Salad.  My salad was good and hit the spot - but to hear her tell it that was the best grilled cheese sandwich she had ever had.  \n\nLooking back on the trip this was one of the culinary highlights. I highly recommend Bar Bacon!' u"Bar Bacon didn't disappoint. We started with a flight of bacon (jalape\xf1o maple brown sugar and one other) and I'm glad we did because it was phenomenal. I'm a sucker for a good Rueben so I ended up getting the house cured lamb bacon Reuben to see how it compares to others I've had. His was absolutely near the top of my list (if not the best I've ever had). I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that remotely likes Rueben's. The house chips are pretty standard so I'd pair it with something different next time. \n\nWe sat at the bar and had excellent service. All around great experience!" u"If you like bacon at all you'll love this place.  My girlfriend and I visited to catch up before her class and I'm so glad we tried out this Hell's Kitchen joint.  We were able to get in before 6PM which means we scored the happy hour price on white sangria for $5...cheaper than you could imagine for Manhattan.  The specialty cocktails with cool bacon-infused liquors were more pricey  (from $13-$15) but the sangrias we got set the stage for some tasty food exploits. \n\n We started with house-made bacon sampler the maple pecan and spicy jalapeno bacons were my favorite and you received two strips of 4 flavors so it was perfect for sharing.  I also ordered the tater tots that came in a neat little fry basket and tasted like crunchy awesomeness along with pulled-pork fried dumplings...and dear baby Jesus they were amazeballs in my face.  I didn't want to share them.  Why weren't they invented years ago?  I could eat them forever.  My girlfriend was very pleased with her seasoned fries and chicken bacon quesadilla and offered to share--but I was lovin' my own grub too much.  \n\nService was fabulous!  It could have been because it was Halloween and the place was only half full but the staff went out of there way to make sure we had water checked in with us and didn't mind when we took forever to choose our treats for ordering.  Very friendly and polite and quick to clear away extra plates.\n\nBottom line:  You're not going to Bar Bacon for diet food...understand that you're going to this place to honor the deliciousness of the bacon in it's natural element.  I can't wait to go back." u"Bacon Themed  // Upscale Casual\nFriendly Staff // Neighborhood spot\n\nThe best bacons paired with the best local artisanal beers. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a bacon bloody mary or have yet to try one then this is a good spot to stop by. Whether you're up for a full meal or just some snacks Bar Bacon's enthusiastic staff clearly loves the place and if you searched for bacon it's likely you'll enjoy this spot too. \n\nThe bacon flight is great for sharing salads and portions are substantial. The more you share the more dishes you can try. I would suggest getting an entree to share and some appetizers. It is easy to get bacon'd out in this place but there are hearty and lighter options. The cocktails with bacon infused are subtle no need to fear! \n\nChef/Owner of the restaurant worked grew up in New York City and worked with Joel Robuchon David Boule the Four Season's Hotel among others. Which is clear when you dig into the details. The very approachable menu crafted by a bacon connoisseur clearly wants to cater to the cravings of a bacon fan. Does it? Well you can be the judge of that. I think when When someone is in the mood for bacon this is a fun HK spot for an adventure.\n\nThe Scene: Low Key Casual Hip\nDestination Rating: 8\nDate Rating: 7\nHob Nob Potential: 7\n\nStrong Suggestion: Try their brunch! Great options. Nice wide windows open on days without rain." u"Really solid brunch spot with a cool sports bar feel. Our waiter recommended the scramble (or pretty much anything with bacon) and it was definitely a good choice. It was light but also plenty filling. The sausage of course was great. The tomatoes were larger than I would've expected/liked but it was a solid combo of ingredients and the toast provided a nice base. The menu seemed a bit pricey but that may just be standard for nyc brunch fare." u"Food: Full of bacon of course and delicious. Although the type of meal itself is very rich due to what the main ingredient is it is definitely a treat to try once in a while as long as you end up balancing it out with something healthy the rest of the week!\n\nCost: Nothing I would consider too expensive or cheap. An average cost for the food that you are getting. It is NY so the price is on the expensive side but that is nothing to be surprised about. \n\nEnvironment: A very relaxed and chill vibe throughout the restaurant. I enjoyed looking at the various items that are on the walls throughout the restaurant. There is this one poster on the wall opposite of where the bathroom is located. It is filled with a bunch of bacon facts that was very interesting!\n\nService: The waiters were all very kind and tended to our needs very well. They all had a bit of a laid-back vibe which was very relaxing and inviting. They provided great recommendations which we listened to and we didn't regret it at all.\n\nUniqueness: Bacon lovers this is paradise. I have never been to a restaurant that specialized with bacon and so this was all very new to me." u"Food was a letdown. I found the bacon on the pulled pork sandwich kind of tough and the pork itself was a little dry. Wasn't impressed by the burger either. Chips were great but fries were meh. We had good service." u"I may have to give this place another try. \n\nFor a while I have been meaning to check out this place for its food because I do not know if anything is better than bacon. For example I could go for a couple strips of bacon right now. I visited this place around 6 pm on a weeknight and it was pretty empty so there was no wait for a table. Since I was starving I did not really inspect the menu and I went for the first non salad item that could be prepared pretty fast. I went with the open faced chicken club (I guess a club sandwich is kind of like a salad) which had applewood smoked bacon and chipotle mayo. Everything besides the chicken was delicious. The chicken component of the sandwich was  dry and rubbery.  I really had to hack at the chicken to cut it into chewable  pieces. Also the chicken really did not have much flavor to it - it helps that there was plenty of chipotle mayo surrounding the sandwich on the plate. The presentation of the dish was very artistic so it had the looks without the flavor. Although my sandwich was a little disappointing I am definitely game for trying some other things on the menu. \n\nBar Bacon really scores points with its diverse craft beer menu (and it's interesting bacon-inspired cocktails). So this place just is not all about bacon it's also all about draaaanks too. I will visit this place again because I very intrigued by the pork belly tacos." u'How have I not reviewed Bar Bacon yet? My dating profile picture includes their cocktail! Granted I think most people are swiping right due to the bacon in the drink...\n\nGood atmosphere tasty bar good (including surprisingly good brussel sprouts) and long drink list. What more could a gal want?' u"Seriously if you're a a bac-aholic like myself this place will hit the spot. The lamb Reuben was so freaking good and the Bloody's are on spot! Great staff and awesome atmosphere I really love the decor." u'I usually take pictures of food but I got too excited about the food and just inhaled it. \n\nItems ordered: Cobb salad (no dressing) and tater tots. The salad was a surprisingly large portion featuring nicely done thick cut bacon. I kind of half wished that I didn\'t order the tater tots but my other half won and ate all of them. \n\nAmbience: Friday night definitely a poppin\' place. Only had a 15 minute wait when we swung by at 630pm. It\'s loud so this is not the place to have a meaningful conversation unless you\'re ok with "what speak up they broke your heart? Is that what happened? Can you tell me again how they dumped you? I missed that part."' u"1st time here and it was my dates pick..\n\nFirst impressions: the space is really nice/cool bartenders and staff were pleasant and laid back loved the open kitchen concept and the aesthetic. it was very hot Wednesday and they didn't have A/C pumping good enough and the fans were on a slow crawl lol. \n\nFood: they have these specials on the chalkboards so I orders the Hanger Steak+Frites ($20 special) it comes with chimichurri and succotash that has a char to it: the delivery of the dish is problematic as it's brought out on a sizzling fajita like cast iron skillet so when I order my steak medium or medium rare it's well done by the time it makes it to me; we all know food continues to cook after you take it off the grill etc. the steak portion was small and drowned in the chimichurri I had to dig for it literally lol. The frites were good the succotash had a char to it that overpowered the taste I only tasted char the whole time and because the skillet was piping hot forever it took me a long time to eat the food was too hot temperature wise to eat it. My date was almost done by time I could eat.\n\nHappy Hour: well drinks draft beers $5 great deal!! The guy with the beard poured nicely lol also the pineapple beer was good and refreshing the Montauk watermelon was a no you don't taste any watermelon. \n\nHigh note: my dates pork-belly tacos were great!! You get 3 I ate one of them since they claim they were spicy either the drizzle or the pickled cabbage has the spice i liked them! \n\n3.5 stars I'll come back to try something else and or atleast to drink but it's summer in NYC turn on your damn a/c." u"Fantastic!!! The lure of beer bacon and bourbon got us. The vibe is very cool. It's a great little gastropub. The music was a little loud but the staff was very nice and helpful in recommending something local to drink. The lamb bacon Ruben is amazing!!! The flavors are great and I never thought to use lamb instead of pastrami. The food overall was a little greasy (which I would expect from bacon based foods but this was a little more than I'd expected). We really liked it and would definitely go back!" u"Bar Bacon is a pretty average gastropub focusing on bacon. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.\n\nI had the chicken club one day for a work lunch and it seemed pretty standard. \n\n\nI appreciate bacon but I don't go out of my way to seek it out. I guess if I knew someone who liked beer and bacon (most guys out there) I'd tell them about this spot." u'This is a great place.. bacon everything!! Beers cold food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. The mac and cheese and the bacon appetizer was amazing. Def coming back. A big must..' u"I've been here twice. It's very kitschy. The food isn't amazing. The first time I got the bacon and beer sampler which was pretty good but honestly not very good for you.\n\nI feel like if I were still 22-26 this would be right up my alley. BEER! BACON! YEAHHHH...except I'm like 30 now and I need some veggies." u'Came here pretty tipsy so might have just been influenced by the alcohol but everything was delicious! Went with a few friends so we split 4 dishes amongst the four of us which was plenty. We went with the platter of bacon sausage with sauerkraut mashed potatoes bacon Mac and cheese and a hamburger with some fries. \n\nThe added bacon was a definite plus but the food was all great on their own as well. Worth the trip if you are a huge bacon fan!' u'WOW! First time visit on a Sunday around 130pm and this place was packed. We had reservations thankfully. Sampled the deep fried pickles and tater tots as an appetizer highly recommend both - they were delicious. As the location name implies this menu is BACON HEAVY. And this is not "typical store bacon"... this is like a slab of BBQ on your plate "bacon". This place is inexpensive and the portions are sizable enough that you can easily need a take home box. Our table sampled a variety of plates - and everyone was satisfied. They happened to be out of quite a few of their brunch menu options which was disappointing. But the Benedict burger mango bacon salad were all delicious. I had an egg scrambler and didn\'t particularly think my option was "Great" but the taste of the meat really threw me off personally.\n\nIn regard to the Benedict: it\'s a traditional benny and they serve the hollandaise on the side so you can drench it to your hearts content. The eggs are served over almost an egg casserole in a small skillet (a sausage bread pudding type casserole with bacon).  The burger was a standard breakfast burger topped with egg and served with house made chips. The bacon mango salad actually was enormous and the "bacon" was enormous CHUNKS of meat - very good. \n\nGet here early and make reservations.' u'A delicious but heavy meal! I ordered the Kentucky Fried Bacon burger which was a fantastic mix of fried bacon pork sausage and pineapple jalape\xf1o coleslaw.
